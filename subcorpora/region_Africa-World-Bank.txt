B.   Introduction and Context

Country Context
Djibouti is extremely water scarce with conditions set to be exacerbated by population growth and 
climate change. As a consequence, access to safe drinking water is a daily challenge for the 
majority of the population, particularly for people living in rural areas. Poverty and food 
insecurity affect more or less the entire country and both are recognized to be highly correlated 
with water access issues. The extreme aspect of the geo-climatic profile leads to low erratic 
annual rainfall that averages hardly 150 mm, to the absence of perennial surface freshwater flow, 
and to the slow renewing of its aquifers. The current situation shows that more than 70 percent of 
the rural population and its herds do not have access to water within a reasonable distance. During 
the three-to four-month dry season, pastoral households are subject to the lack of access to water 
that represents a major constraint to human and livestock mobility, and to the proper use of the 
limited and sparsely distributed agro-pastoral resources.
Sectoral and institutional Context
Climate change impacts are projected to exacerbate these already precarious water resource 
challenges. Climate change is expected to induce an increase of the temperatures by 1.7-2.1 C by 
2050, while precipitation is set to decrease by 4-11 percent . This could lead to an increase of both 
severity of dry spells and intensity of wet extremes, thus accelerating land degradation, floods and 
erosion. Sea level rise is also projected to further exacerbate these impacts through saltwater 
intrusion of coastal aquifers. 
 
The Government of Djibouti (GoD) considers securing access to water and energy as the foremost 
major challenges that are prerequisites to reducing poverty and ensuring a nation-wide sustainable 
socio-economic development. To tackle the country’s structural gap in water resources demand 
and supply, the GoD is in quest of support from key partners for the development of non-
conventional water resources mobilization facilities including desalination plants, sewage water 
treatment plants and transboundary water transfer from Ethiopia.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Original Project Development Objective(s) - Parent
The objective of the Project is to increase access of rural communities to water and enhance their 
capacity to manage water and agro-pastoral resources in the project areas using a participatory 
approach to community-based development.

Key Results 
� Increase in the number of rural households with access to drinking water within a 
reasonable travel time (two hours round trip) in the project areas   
� Increase in the number of heads of livestock with access to water within a reasonable 
distance (20 km radius) in the project areas; 
� Increase in available grazing biomass  in the targeted rangelands in the project areas.  
� Communities in the project areas are organized in community-based structures (CPLs, 
CGEPs and women/fishermen associations) that actively prepare and implement SAAHPs

� Beneficiaries that feel project investments reflect their needs

D.  Project Description

The AF-2 investments will aim to upscale up activities under the parent project to surrounding 
naturally and socially linked pastoral areas, including (i) Community investments (water 
mobilization and soil conservation; agriculture, livestock and Fisheries development; and income-
generating activities), (ii) capacity building and technical assistance and (iii) Project management 
and coordination.

Component Name
Priority Community Investment Subprojects
Comments (optional)
The proposed AF-2 would finance US$4.0 million (57%), to scale-up existing activities, e.g. 
priority community investment sub-projects. The funding covers consultant services for carrying 
out the detailed design and supervision, as well as goods and civil works for the implementation 
and the operation of the community sub-projects. Community investments will be demand-driven 
and will comprise the following sub-projects: (i) water mobilization and soil conservation; (ii) 
agriculture, livestock and Fisheries; and (iii) income-generating activities.

Component Name
Capacity Building and  Provision of Technical Assistance
Comments (optional)
A total of US$1.6 million (23%) will be allocated to scale-up existing activities, e.g. capacity-
building activities and the provision of technical assistance. the AF-2 will finance capacity-
building activities for the PMU, the grassroots organizations such as Water Users Associations 
(WUA) and community groups to support the formulation and the implementation of 
participatory schemes, while improving local contingency planning to better face the impact and 
challenges in the aftermath of extreme events. The component will sensitize and mobilize 
beneficiary communities and other stakeholders to facilitate effective involvement in the planning 
and the project implementation process as well as their awareness on nutrition, sanitary and water 
quality issues. The use of ICT.

Component Name
Project Coordination and Management
Comments (optional)
A total of US$1.1 million (15.7%) will be allocated to further support project coordination and 
management activities. This component will support the PMU through the provision of goods, 
works, consultant services, training and incremental operating costs associated with project 
management, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and audits. Incremental costs to be 
financed include incremental contractual staff costs, office rehabilitation works, equipment and 
operations, transportation equipment and operations, and domestic travel, to name a few.

E.  Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis (if known)

The geographic targeting principles of the proposed AF-2 area of interventions consist mainly in 
scaling-up the activities of the parent project in the neighbor pastoral areas and new fishing areas, 



Page 4 of 8

while consolidating current achievements in the already covered areas. The unit of project 
intervention is based on traditionally recognized local communal grazing areas or "parcours", 
shared by a particular group of localities and communities who possess traditional grazing rights 
over a common area of rangeland. In total, the project area will cover in addition to the 12 
"parcours" already covered by the parent project, six additional with the AF-2 financing: three in 
Obock, (Fididiss-Allaylou, Moulhoulé-Andoli, and Saday-Waddi), one in Tadjoura (Garabtissam-
Balho) and two in Dikhil (Kori-Gagadé and Dawdaya-Der Ela). Two additional fisheries sites will 
also be included in the project areas, e.g. Goubet and Arta-Plage. The extension of PRODERMO 
project activities to the socially linked neighbor pastoral routes  and new fishing areas through 
additional financing will not require additional environmental assessment beyond that which is 
already provided in the current Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Framework 
(ESIAF) prepared for PRODERMO. The existing Environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF) will be updated to address issues related to agricultural inputs, to ensure 
proper management and minimize any adverse impacts.

II. Implementation
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements
No changes are introduced to the institutional, implementation, procurement, or financial 
management arrangements. The Ministry of Agriculture, Water, Fisheries, Livestock and Halieutic 
Resources (MAEPERH) through its existing PMU will continue to be the implementing agency 
responsible for the AF-2 implementation. As indicated previously, the PMU’s Regional Office 
located in Obock, Tadjourah and Dikhil will be reinforced with Staff and vehicles in order to support 
the implementation of the AF-2 activities in the new and additional project area. The other entities 
involved in the AF-2 implementation include the beneficiary communities organized into 
Community Management Committees (CGEPs); the Local Development Committee (CPLs); and 
other community groups, as well as the existing National Steering Committee which was established 
under the original project.

IV. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify 

and describe any potential large scale,  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
While the project might not have significant or irreversible negative impacts, the main risks can be 
controlled by the design and the operation of sub-projects. Groundwater depletion through 
increased used of boreholes can be mitigated through close groundwater monitoring and strict 
adherence to defined recharge regimes.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities 
in the project area:
There are no expected long-term negative social impacts.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts.
N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
Under the parent project and the AF-1, the recipient has satisfactorily implemented the 
requirements of the existing ESMF. The project has designated focal points for the Environmental 
and Social Management Plan (ESMP) implementation in the regions where the project is being 



Page 6 of 8

implemented. Beneficiary communities have also received training on Environmental and Social 
requirements in order to ensure that implementation continues along the various levels of the 
project. Environmental and social screening is carried out regularly with the requisite 
documentation. The PMU prepares monthly reports on the implementation of the Environmental 
and Social Management Framework (ESMF) requirements and shares these with the Bank for 
review. 
 
The project triggers OP/BP 4.01. To meet the requirements of the policy, the recipient has 
prepared an ESMF. The ESMF outlines the screening procedures for the sub-projects, as well as 
the institutional implementation arrangements. 
The project does not trigger OP/BP 4.12. For the parent and the AF-1 operations, the recipient 
prepared documentation tools to ensure that choice and mobilization of land parcels are voluntary 
and participatory.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The revised ESMF was consulted upon in 18 localities, one for each pasture, including women.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
Sierra Leone, a low-income country with a population of 7.1 million people, has made good progress towards political 
stability and economic growth. The country has had three relatively peaceful national elections since the end of the 10 
year civil war in 2002 and recorded average annual growth of 7.8 percent from 2003-2014. Post-war economic growth 
continued to be robust, bolstered by the resumption of iron ore exports, increased inflows of foreign direct investment 
(FDI), and rising government revenues. These developments led to a surge in economic activity, manifested in GDP 
growth of 15.2 percent in 2012 and 13 percent in 2013. In spite of the impressive growth, 2015 GDP per capita was 
US$653.1, well below the Sub-Saharan Africa average of US$1588.5. Poverty levels remain high, even though the 
poverty headcount declined from 66.4 percent in 2003 to 52.9 percent in 2011.

1
 Strong growth in rural areas, where 

poverty declined from 78.7 percent in 2003 to 66.1 percent in 2011, explains much of overall reductions in poverty. 
However, rural poverty level is still higher than urban poverty. While about 62 percent of the working age-population is 
formally or informally employed, there is a dearth of good quality jobs, particularly among urban youth and in rural 
areas.

2
 The lack of sufficient technical and vocational skills needed for the labor market compounds the unemployment 

problem despite the potential offered by a growing workforce that is dominated by young people 
 
Sierra Leone has vast natural resources and the economy is heavily dependent on its land endowments; mineral 
resources including rutile, diamonds, gold, chromite and iron ore; water and tourism. Agriculture including forestry and 
fisheries still accounts for the largest GDP share but that share declined from 57percent in 2012 to 41percent in 2013. 
The mining sector’s contribution to GDP increased substantially from 8.5 percent in 2011 to 16.8 percent in 2012 and 
on to 27.2 percent in 2013 due to the expansion of large-scale iron ore operations. The service sector, led by banking, 
retail, transport and tourism, accounted for 28.8 percent of GDP in 2013, down from 35.5 percent in 2011, while the 
manufacturing sector, dominated by cement and light manufacturing, accounts for only 2percent of GDP.

3
  

 
 
 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
The promotion of value addition and private sector-led growth in agriculture are essential elements in achieving its 
vision and goal of the AfP. The National Sustainable Agriculture Development Plan (NSADP) serves as the overarching 
sector strategy with a focus on: (i) Commodity Commercialization, (ii) Agriculture Infrastructure Development, (iii) 
Private Sector Promotion and (iv) Sector Coordination and Management. Through the NSDAP, The Smallholder 
Commercialization Program (SCP) 2010 -2015, helped organize smallholder farmers by establishing Farmer Based 
Organizations (FBOs) and Agribusiness Centers (ABCs), involving about 122,500 farmers, of which 30 percent were 
female-headed households. The ABCs were designed as farmer-owned multi-purpose facilities delivering a broad range 
of services, including micro-credit, sales of inputs and tools, rental of labour-saving equipment, storage of seeds and 
farm products, processing, transport, information on new technologies and markets and group marketing. The 
successor of the SCP, the Inclusive Comprehensive Agricultural Development Program (ICADEP), 2016-2020 focuses on 
private sector-led commercialization and agribusiness development as a basis for inclusive growth. Key tenets of the 
strategy emphasizes reduced government intervention with an emphasis on implementing evidence-based private

sector support policies and projects.  
 
Strengthening economic diversification is a policy priority for achieving strong and sustainable growth and reducing 
poverty in Sierra Leone. Currently, the economy is dominated by mining and agriculture but there is huge potential to 
diversify into other sectors such as fisheries, light manufacturing, and tourism. While mining has dimmed, there are 
bright prospects for agribusiness investments. The Sierra Leone Investment and Export Promotion Agency (SLIEPA), has 
prioritized increased investment inflows in agribusiness as a key objective in its Strategic Plan, 2016 – 2018. This strategy 
aims to attract domestic and foreign direct investments and to develop and diversify exports, particularly in the 
agricultural sector, given the sector’s contribution to GDP and livelihoods. In addition, SLIEPA supports SMEs to enhance 
their competitiveness and participation in trade. Both the investment Promotion and Export Development and 
Promotion Departments have developed strategies and activities that focus on enhancing competitiveness of 
agribusiness, SMEs and other segments in agribusiness value chains that have strong potential for creating jobs and 
income opportunities. 
 
Relationship to CPF 
 
The proposed project is aligned to Pillar 1 of the Bank’s Strategy for Africa, competitiveness and employment and 
consistent with the pillars on diversified economic growth and international competitiveness in GoSL’s Agenda for 
Prosperity, the Third Generation Poverty Reduction Strategy, 2013-2018. The AfP prioritizes agriculture and 
agribusiness as a key sector for promoting economic diversification because of its long term potential for inclusive 
sustainable growth and value addition. In addition, the proposed project is aligned to components 2 and 3 of the 
Inclusive Comprehensive Agricultural Development Project (ICADEP) that focus on commercialization and agribusiness 
development. Project interventions are also consistent with the Private Sector Recovery Priorities relating to creating 
jobs and supporting MSMEs to increase their competitiveness in key agricultural value chains.  
 

The proposed project will directly contribute to the Joint Country Assistance Strategy (JCAS) 2010-2013. Pillar 1 on 
promoting inclusive growth. The 2012 Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report (CASPR) recognized the potential of 
agriculture, agricultural value addition, and supporting services in driving an inclusive growth strategy. 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 

 
 
The project objective is to improve business environment in agribusiness sector and increase productivity of targeted 
agro-processing firms in Sierra Leone. 

 
Key Results (From PCN) 

 

 Lower unit cost of production for local agro-processing firms 
 

 Increased agro processing investment (from existing and new agro-processing firms) 
 

 Improved institutional framework for coordination of agro processing investments

D. Concept Description 
In Sierra Leone, productivity and growth of agro-processing firms is held back by key market failures and constraints, 
characterized by limited knowledge of FDI linkages and market opportunities, coordination externalities, weak supply 
chain linkages, lack of access to finance and technology, policy failures, and skills gap. Consequently, most local and 
foreign-owned agro-processing firms have installed modern plants and utilize state of the art technology but have low 
productivity and operate at less than 30 percent utilization 
 
The proposed project focuses on enhancing domestic value addition in agro-processing through strengthening vertical 
(forward and backward) linkages between local companies and foreign investors. Such linkages provide important 
channels for enhancing competitiveness of the sub-sector through flow of new technology, know-how, innovation, and 
skills. Interventions supporting domestic value addition in agro-processing will involve local and foreign actors that are 
operating in the sub-sector as well as those that provide goods and services to the industry. Project interventions will 
emphasize upgrading of local large enterprises and SMEs, enabling them to be competitive in domestic, regional, and 
international markets.  

 
Project interventions will address key market failures and constraints that limit competitiveness of agro-processing firms 
in domestic and international markets (see annex 1). Modalities for project support will include financing and technical 
assistance for targeted investment promotion and retention and connecting local companies to foreign investors in ways 
that enhance the benefits of agglomeration economies and networking effects 
 

 
 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The project location is collocated with the catchment area of the SCADeP Project. The specific sub-project sites are yet to 

be determined. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The Ministry of Trade and Industry being the burrower for the project will work in close collaboration with the Ministry 

of Agriculture Forestry and Food Security through the Worldbank Funded Smallholder Commercialization and 
Agribusiness Development Project (SCADeP). The project coordinating unit for the implementation of the project will 
recruit a safeguards specialist and will work in close collaboration with the safeguards specialist of the SCADeP project 
who are already in place. It is expected that through the close collaboration with the SCADeP project, the needed capacity 
building for the client will take place throughout implementation.

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The proposed project categorization is B (partial 
assessment). The project will fund agro-processing 
equipment and other value chain enhancement 
activities, the impacts associated with these activities 
are expected to be site-specific and reversible in 
nature. An environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF) will be prepared and disclosed 
prior to appraisal. The ESMF will outline measures for 
screening of sub-projects to determine any further 
environmental assessment that might be required 
during implementation. The ESMF will also provide a 
template for the preparation of an EMP based on the 
screening results of sub-projects. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No 

The project is not expected to impact on any natural 
habitats because the proposed activities will be limited 
to existing agro processing firms. The project is also 
not expected to fund any expansions in agriculture 
production areas. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No Forests will not be impacted by the project 

Pest Management OP 4.09 No 
The project activities do not involve any pest 
management activities. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No 
It is not expected that any physical cultural resources 
will be impacted. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
The policy is not triggered because there are no 
indigenous people (as per definition) in the project 
area. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 TBD 

Triggering OP4.12 will be determined during appraisal. 
The project will provide matching grant to support 
domestic value addition in agro-processing. The 
project still needs to clarify whether or not the 
activities funded under the matching grant will lead to 
construction of warehouses, agro-processing units or 
any activities that may require land acquisition. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 
The Project does not involve construction or 
rehabilitation / maintenance of dams. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No The Project does not involve International Waterways. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No The Project does not involve Disputed Areas.

below the poverty line and 34 percent fall below the extreme poverty line (CPF, 2016). The country is 
also beset with high unemployment rates and a high incidence of HIV/AIDS. This interaction of socio-
economic factors and environmental constraints results in low agricultural productivity with maize 
yields averaging only 800 kg/ha leading to food and nutrition insecurity.

Variations in the Kingdom’s topography and micro-climate shape its ecological zones—the lowlands, 
the foothills, the highlands, and the Senqu (Orange) River Valley. Annual precipitation is highly 
variable, both temporally and spatially, ranging from 500 mm to 760 mm. Temperatures are also 
highly variable, ranging from –10°C to 30°C. Agriculture accounts for less than 10 percent of the 
country’s gross domestic product, but it provides employment for as many as 63 percent of the 
country's population. The crop sector’s contribution to agriculture GDP declined by 17.2% in 2015, 
with the main crops of maize, sorghum, and wheat planted on more than 85 percent of the cultivated 
area.  Livestock contributes 30 percent of total agricultural output, including domestic production of 
pigs and poultry and extensive production of wool and mohair on rangelands in the hill and highland 
areas.
The IPCC categorizes Lesotho as one of the countries highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate 
change. The country has a temperate climate with subalpine characteristics, having four distinct 
seasons, and experiences regular droughts, floods, frosts, snow, hailstorms, and strong winds.  
Frequent droughts result in poor harvests and large livestock losses to rural farmers. Dry spells also 
create food shortages and can lead to an increase in invasive plants and destructive insects. Strong 
winds and floods also pose devastating threats to Lesotho’s agricultural sector; as a result, there are 
large swings in output, with maize yields ranging from a high of more than 1.5 t/ha in 1977 to only 
170 kg/ha in 2011.

The impact of climate change on crop and livestock production systems, and consequently livelihoods, 
may be severe if existing cropping and land use systems remain unchanged.  Lesotho is over-reliant on 
rain-fed agriculture for food production and has a large rural population engaged in undiversified 
subsistence farming. Climate change and increasing climate variability may be reflected in reduced 
crop yields and increased incidence of crop failure. There is also likely to be a decrease in forage 
production and a decline in the carrying capacity of the rangelands, which will have negative impacts 
on livestock production resulting from reduced animal vigor and fertility. As animal condition 
deteriorates, the quality of animal products, especially wool may decline. Furthermore, there may be a 
higher incidence of livestock pests and diseases which will have negative implications for animal 
production.

Less than 1 percent of crop production in Lesotho is under irrigation and almost all subsistence and 
smallholder farming is rain-fed. The development of medium to larger irrigation schemes is expensive 
and may not be suitable due to the demanding topography and geology, and lack of local scheme 
management skills and experience is a serious limitation. The fragile soils also demand very careful 
irrigation management. Thus, while water is available, it is being allocated for other purposes and 
farmers have yet to productively exploit their country’s water resources. Small-scale water harvesting 
schemes are seriously lacking and yet these remain viable adaption options for smallholders in the face 
of expected climate change impacts on water resources.

The commercial farming sector in Lesotho  remains underdeveloped. Full-time commercial farmers 
are still few in number, and specialized agribusiness firms are equally scarce. Lesotho stands in stark 
contrast with neighboring South Africa, where production, processing, and distribution of food is 
carried out by commercial producers and agribusiness firms.

Opportunities continue to exist in Lesotho for developing commercially viable smallholder agriculture. 



Demographic changes, compounded by rising incomes and accelerating urbanization, and improved 
access to South African markets, are fueling changes in consumption patterns that are creating new 
opportunities for agricultural producers and processors. Local and regional demand is projected to 
continue to strengthen in the coming years for fresh fruits and vegetables; for meat and processed 
livestock products (sold through local market stalls, small and medium-scale butcheries, and large-
scale meat wholesalers); for milk and dairy products; and, for processed foods and products (dried 
fruits, processed meat and animal feed).

Continued support to smallholders and close coordination at the national, district and community 
levels is still needed.  Strategies for strengthening smallholder capacity must take into account the 
communities’ stated needs and aspirations and align them with targeted innovations to create resilience 
and sustainability.  However, guidance is needed to help farmers gradually re-orientate their farming 
approaches to produce for markets and to be resilient to the imminent impacts of climate change in 
fragile and highly vulnerable production systems.

Two options for scaling-up the SADP were considered: (i) increase counterpart funding; and (ii) seek 
additional IDA 17 financing. Given fiscal restrictions, the Government of Lesotho is unable to 
increase counterpart funding for the SADP. Therefore, additional IDA 17 financing was identified as 
the most appropriate mechanism to enable expansion of the SADP’s activities to new districts. With 
the AF, the SADP’s objectives, which include increasing marketed output among project beneficiaries 
in Lesotho’s smallholder agriculture sector, can be expanded in more districts in the country, 
contributing to government efforts to develop smallholder agriculture. The proposed scale-up can be 
completed by February 28, 2020 – representing a cumulative implementation period of less than ten 
years. The original closing date is March 31, 2018.

The AF for the Smallholder Agricultural Development Project (SADP II) will continue to support 
smallholder farmers in targeted areas of Lesotho – Botha-Bothe, Leribe, Berea, and Mafeteng, rural 
Maseru, Mohale's Hoek, and Quthing – with the goal of helping them exploit opportunities to increase 
their productivity in a changing climate and diversify into market-oriented agriculture, and to improve 
the enabling environment for agribusiness activities.  Project support will continue to be driven by 
market opportunities and perceived commercial viability of enterprises and products.  These three 
additional border districts with good potential and accessibility to markets, have a rural population of 
almost 500,000 people (about 100,000 households); a cropped area of about 80,000 ha; and ready 
access to Maseru and South African markets due to their location along the border.  The addition of 
these three districts will result in all of the more productive lowlands and foothill areas being included 
in the project.  It is expected that at least an additional 18,000 beneficiaries will benefit from the AF in 
addition to the 55,000 already reached under SADP.

The overall zones of intervention for this project have been identified and prioritized to complement 
current activities supported under the Smallholder Agriculture Development Project (SADP) and to 
consolidate and support the achievements under SADP.  SADP supports smallholder farmers in 
targeted areas of Lesotho, with the goal of helping them exploit opportunities to diversify into market-
oriented agriculture. SADP is driven by market opportunities and perceived commercial viability of 
enterprises. The proposed Additional Financing will focus on continuing to increase the capacity of 
farmers in Lesotho, smallholder and commercial, to build more productive climate resilient 
commercial agricultural systems.

The incremental benefits of this AF are expected to be extensive. For example, by initiating the 
process of discussing food quality and safety standards in Lesotho, the GoL and the international 
community can begin to finance and provide the focused expertise and funds needed to undertake 



actions in setting standards and strengthen capacity to enforce them.

Sectoral and Institutional Context

Rural and agricultural sector. Manufacturing and mining contribute the largest shares to GDP in 
Lesotho, but agriculture remains important as a major provider of employment and source of food.  
About 70-80 percent of Lesotho’s people live in rural areas, and more than three-quarters of these are 
engaged in agriculture – mostly traditional, low input, low output, rain-fed cereal production and 
extensive animal grazing.  In the past, remittances from mineworkers were a major source of rural 
livelihoods, providing vital cash needed to purchase agricultural inputs and productive assets or to 
invest in household assets and housing, but remittances have declined steadily over the past decade as 
the number of Basotho employed in the South African mining sector has declined substantially from 
more than 100,000 20 years ago to less than 30,000 at present. Despite the economic growth that has 
been achieved in recent years, income-generating opportunities remain limited and are generally 
confined to urban areas and wage employment in the industrial sector especially in garment 
production.

Because the urban economy has limited ability to absorb new labor market entrants, the rural economy 
in general and agriculture in particular will continue to play a major role in Lesotho’s development 
strategy for the foreseeable future. Agricultural development faces a number of challenges; however, 
most significant are difficult agro-climatic conditions and limited availability of irrigable arable land. 
The country’s limited production potential is not fully exploited due to poor farming practices, limited 
use of quality seeds, inappropriate crop selection and lack of diversification. Agricultural productivity 
is further undermined by unsustainable land management practices that in many cases have led to 
declining soil fertility and severe soil erosion. If agriculture were commercially viable, these 
constraints could likely be overcome through well-targeted investments, but the development of 
market-oriented crop and livestock production enterprises faces a number of constraints such as 
limited small-scale irrigation, lack of access to finance, and limited supply of produce of the required 
quality.

Institutional Context:
The successful transformation of Lesotho’s smallholder agricultural sector will continue to depend on 
sustained support in the form of technical advisory services, improved technology, and investment 
capital, among other factors. This support has come from three main sources: (i) public service 
providers, (ii) producer organizations, trade associations, and other industry groups; (iii) NGOs and 
donor-funded programs. SADP II will continue to benefit from the current institutional arrangement of 
having the PMU embedded within the main service provider in this sector - MAFS, which has proven 
efficient as an implementation and communication strategy. The Ministry of Forestry, Range and Soil 
Conservation continue to be implementing partners in NRM projects along with the Ministry of Water 
Affairs.  Producer groups such as piggery and poultry associations, as well as wool and mohair 
grower’s associations are also important partners and can prove instrumental in setting standards, 
prices and spreading knowledge towards increasing marketed output; however, much still needs to be 
done for this to be realized.  NGOs and donors provide services in support of agricultural 
development.  Most technological innovations continue to be introduced by both national and 
international NGOs, donor-funded projects and programs, and by private entrepreneurs in some cases.

D. Project Description

The proposed AF offers a well performing vehicle to scale up smallholder agricultural productivity to 
other districts in Lesotho – reinforcing a key component of the CPF pillar on private sector jobs, in 
line with Lesotho’s National Strategic Development Plan.  The AF provides combined multi-faceted 
support in the form of technical advisory services, improved technology, and investment capital that 
are key to meeting the government’s goals in the new districts. The AF will be allocated to expand 
project activities to three additional border districts with good potential and accessibility to markets, 
namely rural Maseru, Mohale's Hoek and Quthing.  The addition of these three districts will result in 
all of the more productive lowlands and foothill areas being included in the project.  It is expected that 
at least an additional 18,000 beneficiaries will benefit from the AF in addition to the 55,000 already 
reached under SADP.

E. Project location and Salient physical characteristics            relevant to the safeguard analysis 
(if known)
The activities to be financed by the Additional Financing include small-scale gravity irrigation 
schemes, small-scale water harvesting structures such as weirs and tanks for households or community 
groups, small-scale investments in livestock operations (such as piggery), cultivation of high value 
crops, wool and mohair production, production of tree seedlings and horticulture, processing and 
storage, rangeland management, climate smart agriculture, gully reclamation and catchment 



conservation. Although a list of potential sub-projects is known, the specific sub-project locations are 
not yet known. The project is designed as demand driven and, therefore, the exact locations will only 
be known at the time when the applications are received by the PMU through the Competitive Grants 
Programme. This will take place during the implementation phase of the project.

The Additional Financing will be scaled up in three (3) additional districts which have been identified 
as suitable for agriculture and have good potential for accessing markets, namely (i) rural Maseru, (ii) 
Mohale's Hoek, and (iii) Quthing located in the southern lowlands agro-ecological zone. ..

Topographically, Lesotho is predominantly mountainous, with the mountain zone covering 
approximately 65% of the total land area. The land is mostly characterized by steep slopes with fragile 
soil formations which are extensively degraded. Only 9% of Lesotho’s land is arable and over 80% of 
this is found in the lowlands, where it is not only used for agriculture, but rather for other purposes 
such as housing. They typically have rich black soils or sandy loams in the valleys where the major 
agricultural activities occur. The southern lowlands, where the new districts are located, are 
characterized by poor soils and low rainfall and cover the western part of the country, occupying about 
2,700 km2 which is 9% of the total surface area. Generally, the lowland soils are the duplex type 
which are prone to erosion, and have poor moisture retention capacity. They are thus liable to rapid 
loss of top soil. The region forms the main livestock grazing area in the country. Although the soils are 
much less susceptible to erosion, inadequate grass cover combined with the steep slopes, and torrential 
rains result in massive erosion in this zone. It will be important to include sub-projects that will control 
runoff and control soil erosion such as sustainable landscape management, gully reclamation, 
catchment management and small-scale infrastructure such as gabions and check dams.

II. IMPLEMENTATION
The AF will benefit from the institutional arrangements established under Parent Project which 
established a Project Management Unit (PMU) However, the capacity of the existing Project 
Management Unit (PMU) to implement, monitor and report on environmental and social 
safeguard issues during the implementation of the Parent Project was inadequate. With the 
guidance of the World Bank, the PMU is currently in the process of recruiting a dedicated 
environmental and social specialist who will oversee the screening of sub-projects to determine 
the level and degree of risk and impacts, ensure that site-specific ESMPs are prepared and 
mitigation measures are implemented, monitored and reported on in the progress reports, and 
which will eventually strengthen the capacity of the PMU. Further safeguard training will be 
provided by the World Bank staff throughout the implementation phase to ensure adequate 
capacity is retained.
.

III. SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY
Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 
4.01

Yes The Additional Financing to the Lesotho 
Smallholder Agriculture Development 
Program will maintain the Environmental 
Category B classification of the Parent 



Project. Environmental risks and impacts 
inherent to the agriculture and agribusiness 
industry are largely related to effluent 
discharges from use of pesticides/herbicides in 
controlling weed infestation, use of fertilizer 
to increase crop productivity, pollution of soil 
and water resources from runoff, occupational 
health and safety of workers, efficient use of 
water and energy resources, and solid waste 
disposal. The review of the ESMF of the 
Parent Project indicates that the instrument is 
adequate for the Additional Financing in terms 
of identifying potential environmental impacts 
that will likely occur from implementing the 
project activities, the proposed measures to 
mitigate the impacts and monitor the 
implementation, the pest management 
approaches to be used to ensure sustainable 
use of fertilizers and pesticides, and 
community health and safety issues. The 
ESMF also contains adequate and very clear 
screening procedures and methodologies to 
guide the PIU in the screening, assessment, 
review, approval, implementation and 
reporting of environmental issues for the sub-
projects.

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No The project will not support sub-projects that 
have the potential to adversely alter or impact 
natural or critical habitats as defined under OP 
4.04. Therefore, the policy is not triggered.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No The project will not support sub-projects 
located within forested areas or plantations as 
defined under OP 4.36. Therefore, the policy 
is not triggered.

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes The Pest Management Policy is triggered to 
allow for the use of agrochemicals, as needed, 
using licensed professions and in a manner 
described in the Integrated Pest Management 
Plan (IPMP). The initial screening of the 
potential sub-projects to be funded under the 
AF, indicates that the risk of pesticides use is 
minor to moderate due to the small amounts of 
pesticides currently being used in the sub-
projects of the Parent Project. The ESMF 
prepared for the Parent Project, incorporates 
an Integrated Pest Management Plan (IPMP) 
which provides guidance on the sustainable 
application of fertilizers and pesticides taking 
into consideration the soil type and slope to 



ensure protection of watershed and 
groundwater. The use or purchase of 
significant amounts of pesticides will be 
excluded in the screening process described in 
the ESMF.

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 
4.11

No The AF will not support physical cultural 
resources but in some of the districts that the 
project will be implemented, artifacts from 
historical cultural resources have been found. 
The ESMF of the Parent Project have included 
Physical Cultural Resources Chance Find 
procedures for handling chance finds that 
might occur during the implementation of the 
sub-projects.

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No OP 4.10 is not triggered as there are no 
indigenous people within the project area of 
influence.

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes It is not anticipated that there will be any land 
acquisitions as a direct result of the project. 
However, communities are expected to 
continue to pool their land or provide 
voluntary land donations of communal land. 
This potentially impact livelihood through 
affecting access, for example for grazing and 
water. The existing RPF will be applied to 
screen and guide implementation.

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No OP 4.37 is not triggered as the project will not 
finance construction or rehabilitation of dams, 
nor will it rely on the performance of an 
existing dam or a dam under construction, as 
defined in the policy.

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50

No The project is not expected to affect 
international waterways and, therefore, OP 
7.50 is not triggered.

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 
7.60

No The project will not finance any activities 
located in any known areas under territorial 
dispute as defined in OP 7.60. Therefore, the 
policy is not triggered.

.

IV. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and 
describe any potential large scale,  significant and/or irreversible impacts:

The activities to be financed by the Additional Financing include small-scale gravity irrigation 
schemes, small-scale water harvesting structures such as weirs and tanks for households or 
community groups, small-scale investments in livestock operations (such as piggery), 



cultivation of high value crops, wool and mohair production, production of tree seedlings and 
horticulture, processing and storage, rangeland management, climate smart agriculture, gully 
reclamation and catchment conservation. The sub-projects are similar to those that are already 
being financed under the Parent Project, and therefore the AF will maintain the Environmental 
Category B classification of the Parent Project. Environmental risks and impacts inherent to 
the agriculture and agribusiness industry are largely related to effluent discharges from use of 
pesticides/herbicides in controlling weed infestation, use of fertilizer to increase crop 
productivity, pollution of soil and water resources from runoff, occupational health and safety 
of workers, efficient use of water and energy resources, and solid waste disposal. The 
anticipated risks and impacts are expected to be small-scale in nature and scope, limited to the 
project sites and can be addressed with known mitigation measures. Overall, there are no large 
scale, significant or irreversible impacts that have been identified.

The PMU will use the ESMF of the Parent Project – which describes the screening, 
reviewing, implementing and monitoring procedures – to assess the risks and impacts and 
prepare the appropriate mitigation measures during the implementation phase.  Review of the 
ESMF of the Parent Project indicates that the instrument is adequate for the Additional 
Financing in terms of identifying potential environmental impacts that will likely occur from 
implementing the project activities, the proposed measures to mitigate the impacts and 
monitor the implementation, the pest management approaches to be used to ensure sustainable 
use of fertilizers and pesticides, and community health and safety issues. The ESMF also 
contains adequate and very clear screening procedures and methodologies to guide the PIU in 
the screening, assessment, review, approval, implementation and reporting of environmental 
issues for the sub-projects.

Review of the environmental performance of the Parent Project:

The team has been continuously reviewing the environmental performance the Parent Project 
through regular missions to the sub-project sites, and the overall environmental performance 
of the Parent Project is moderately unsatisfactory. Some of the issues identified under the 
parent project relate to, for example, improper handling of solid and liquid waste, insufficient 
monitoring of water access, improper handling of agrochemicals. A detailed time bound 
action plan has been agreed with the Borrower to remedy any environmental issues and avoid 
them reoccurring in the future

Climate Vulnerability
There is a need for climate vulnerability to be considered particularly during the siting of 
subprojects.  One poultry subproject is located on a mountainside exposed to severe wind and 
cold, and consequently many of the chickens died. Recently, a number of horticulture tunnels 
were damaged due to strong winds, hail and rain, and although these conditions were 
reportedly a one-off event, tunnels that were located in less sheltered terrain were more 
severely damaged than those that were somewhat sheltered.   The siting of subprojects taking 
into account climatic factors is therefore important in ensuring sustainability of the 
investments.
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in 
the project area:



The sub-projects to be supported under the AF will not generate indirect and/or long term 
impacts in the sub-project areas. It is, however, anticipated that some of the sub-projects that 
entail landscape restoration and management, will result into long term positive and beneficial 
impacts.
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts.

In accordance with the RPF, voluntary land contributions will only be permitted where the 
land is communal land. If private use the communal land contributed under the project exists, 
then the private users must either benefit directly from project activities or be provided 
suitable alternatives. Such arrangements must be fully documented and are subject to 
informed consent procedures.
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.

The Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) prepared for the Parent 
Project by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security will serve as the key environmental 
safeguard instrument for the project. Review of the ESMF by the project team indicate that 
the instrument is adequate for the Additional Financing in terms of identifying potential 
environmental impacts that will likely occur from implementing the project activities, the 
proposed measures to mitigate the impacts and monitor the implementation, the pest 
management approaches to be used to ensure sustainable use of fertilizers and pesticides, and 
community health and safety issues. The ESMF also contains adequate and very clear 
screening procedures and methodologies to guide the PIU in the screening, assessment, 
review, approval, implementation and reporting of environmental issues for the sub-projects

With the guidance of the World Bank, the PMU is currently in the process of recruiting a 
dedicated environmental and social specialist who will oversee the screening of sub-projects 
to determine the level and degree of risk and impacts, site-specific ESMPs are prepared and 
mitigation measures are implemented, monitored and reported on in the progress reports, and 
which will eventually strengthen the capacity of the PMU. Further safeguard training will be 
provided by the World Bank staff throughout the implementation phase to ensure adequate 
capacity is retained. The first task to be carried out by the PMU environmental specialist will 
be to undertake an environmental audit for all ongoing sub-projects to assess the extent to 
which the World Bank Safeguard Polices are complied with and make recommendations on 
how environmental risks and impacts will be mitigated.

All other institutions that will be involved in implementing the AF have previously 
implemented World Bank funded projects or are currently involved in implementation of 
other World Bank programs. As such they are familiar with World Bank safeguard policies 
and have gained experience in the implementation and oversight of Bank projects.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

The safeguards documents (ESMF and RPF) were subject to discussions with various groups 
of stakeholders at district and national level, including relevant government agencies, national 
and international NGOs, and farmer associations during appraisal of the original project in 



2011. In addition, beneficiary farmers and communities will receive appropriate training, as 
they will participate in screening, verification and mitigation measures (as relevant).

Country Context
The Kingdom of Lesotho is a small, landlocked, lower-middle-income country with a per capita 
GNI of US$1,350. Lesotho is one of the poorest countries in Southern Africa, and has one of the 
highest income inequality in the world. Home to about 2 million people, Lesotho is surrounded by 
South Africa, the second largest and most industrialized economy in Africa. Lesotho generates 
income mainly by exporting textiles, water, and diamonds, and is a member of the Southern 
African Customs Union (SACU), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and 
the Common Monetary Area (CMA). The national currency➢❨  the loti➢❨ is pegged to the South 
African rand. Lesotho➢❨ s main trading partners are South Africa and the United States. 
 
Several factors are concerning for Lesotho➢❨ s fiscal and economic outlook: in the short term, a 
projected sharp decline in SACU revenues and higher food prices caused by drought; in the 
medium term, insecurity in textile manufacturing given uncertainty of continued renewal of the 
African Growth and Opportunity Act, and risks caused by the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Lesotho 
now faces large fiscal and current account deficits, which will require substantial fiscal 
adjustment to restore macroeconomic stability and avert erosion of the exchange rate peg to the 
South African rand.  
 
The signs of fragility are exacerbated by other vulnerabilities, such as political instability, climatic 
vulnerability, including El NiÃ±o, and high rates of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), and maternal 
and infant mortality. The 2015/16 El NiÃ±o induced drought prompted authorities to declare a 
state of emergency in December 2015, with a high share of the rural population now expected to 
be food insecure through the March 2017 harvest. For Lesotho➢❨ s small and highly dependent 
subsistence farming economy, El NiÃ±o related stress factors risks further depressing household 
incomes, which had already dropped due to declining migrant remittances from South Africa➢❨ s 
mining sector. Lesotho➢❨ s poor historical record in addressing climatic vulnerabilities adds to 
the capacity risks. The burden of disease is disproportionately higher among HIV/AIDS affected 
households.
Sectoral and institutional Context
Several factors hinder Lesotho➢❨ s private-sector growth, affecting both Foreign Direct 
Investment (FDI) and the growth of the local micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). The 
Trans-Pacific partnership could cause FDI in textile manufacturing to fall over the medium term. 
All quantitative measures ➢❨  including the Global Trade Reports, Doing Business Indicators, 
and Enterprise Surveys ➢❨  suggest that business regulations seriously constrain growth. Despite 
making progress in streamlining business and property registration and in establishing and 
operating a credit bureau, Lesotho ranks low on key Doing Business Indicators ➢❨  such as 
dealing with construction permits, accessing finance, and the cost of capital. These are constraints 
on domestic entrepreneurship, suggesting that the domestic private sector remains dependent on 
the state and non-tradable sectors. Over the last two decades, Lesotho shifted its growth drivers 
from export-led development towards dependency on government spending. 
 
Increased public spending has further crowded out private sector investment. Limited job 
opportunities in the private sector have exacerbated poverty and inequality and led to a situation 
in which the public sector has become a de facto social safety by absorbing employment which 
has led to a bloated public sector and oversized public spending. This has led to a vicious cycle 
that simultaneously crowds out investment in the country.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Original Project Development Objective(s) - Parent
The development objective of the proposed project is to contribute to the development of selected 
non-textile sectors resulting in increased private sector investment, firm growth and job creation.

Proposed Project Development Objective(s) - Additional Financing
To improve the business environment for firms, strengthen select government institutions, and 
further diversify the economy.

Key Results 
The Additional Financing (AF) would seek to ensure that: (i) legislation supported by the Project 
is passed and implemented, (ii) automated systems supported by the Project are widely used, (iii) 
institutional changes supported by the Project are completed and institutional entities are fully 
operational, and (iv) deciduous fruit production, piloted by the Project, is supported by an 
enabling environment that facilitates investment in the sector. A new activity would include 
support for issues of trade facilitation and logistics given their cross-cutting importance to the 
economy.

D.  Project Description

The AF will provide additional support to the three original components, as well as support a new 
subcomponent on trade facilitation and logistics. Activities have been chosen for the following 
reasons: (i) those which can be completed during the time available for implementation of the AF; 
(ii) those with overall positive results during the current project; (iii) those where implementation 
needs to continue in order for benefits for firms to be realized and sustained; (iv) those with 
significant stakeholder buy-in and clear alignment with the country➢❨ s economic needs and 
policies, including the Vision 2020 and the NSDP for 2012➢❨ 2017; and (v) those 
complementary with other private sector development projects.  
 
Component 1: 
 
Project activities under this component will continue to support efforts to reduce the time and cost 
associated with doing business, and increase access to finance. Subcomponent 1A would be 
divided into two subcomponents, in order to properly reflect anticipated results against Doing 
Business indicators. A new subcomponent on trade facilitation and logistics aims to make trading 
across borders faster and cheaper for firms. 
 
In Subcomponent 1A, support would continue under the AF for the enactment of the business 
registration and licensing bill, and the implementation of automated business licensing and e-
payment gateway services at the One Stop Business Facilitation Centre (OBFC). The AF would 
additionally support: 
 
(i) Strengthening of the OBFC, which would include developing OBFC➢❨ s legal framework; 
integrating the Business Registration system with LRA➢❨ s system to issue tax identifier 
numbers; supporting OBFC management; designing and implementing a capacity building 
program; completing necessary technology upgrades; developing and deploying a reform 
communication strategy; and creating public access sites in various districts for OBFC and other 



Page 4 of 12

government-to-business services. 
 
(ii) Improving business inspections reform, through a careful review of the legal and regulatory 
framework, the training of inspectors, and the development of a business inspections policy and 
associated manuals, risk-assessment tools, and training modules for its implementation. 
 
In Subcomponent 1B (formerly part of 1A) support would continue for the automation of the 
construction permit system. The AF would additionally support the implementation of an e-
payment system, and system support and maintenance for two years.  
 
In Subcomponent 1C (formerly 1B), support would continue under the AF for access to finance 
activities. 
With regards to the establishment of the credit information bureau (CIB), the AF would 
additionally support: 
 
(i) Expanding CIB coverage to include businesses, which would require legal reforms since the 
current law only allows for collection of consumer (individual) data. 
  
(ii) Training to enable credit providers associations and microfinance institutions to upgrade 
systems and processes and use various new credit information tools being developed by the 
project. 
With regards to the establishment of a movable assets collateral registry, the AF would 
additionally support: (i) extensive campaigns to raise public awareness; (ii) development of a 
mobile application; (iii) development and implementation of a capacity building program for 
credit providers; (iv) continuous alignment and harmonization of associated laws. 
 
With regards to the establishment of a leasing industry, the AF would support technical assistance 
on financial leasing for credit providers.  
 
With regards to insolvency reform, the AF would additionally support: (i) extensive campaigns to 
raise public awareness; (ii) intensive training to prepare for the implementation of the new Bill, 
focused on the Office of the Master of the High Court, the judiciary, and insolvency practitioners; 
and (iii) the design and implementation of ICT systems to ensure efficiency in insolvency 
proceedings and for the Master of the High Court. 
 
Finally, in order to ensure the sustainability of ongoing reforms and to entrench capacity within 
Lesotho to generate further reforms as needed, an institutional assessment of the Office of 
Parliamentary Counsel (OPC) will be undertaken under the AF in the areas of technology, skills, 
and human resources, and a training and capacity building plan will be developed and deployed. 
 
Subcomponent 1D would be new, and it would support two trade facilitation and logistics 
activities. Importantly, the majority of the related technical assistance and training would be 
funded by the LICP. 
 
(i) Support for Customs operations. This would cover the upgrading of ASYCUDAWorld, 
including additional modules, and the provision of redundancy for the system: a disaster recovery 
site to secure and sustain the customs operation, a back-up server, a stand by generator and other 
equipment as required. 



Page 5 of 12

 
(ii) Support for preparing and developing a single window that would connect selected 
government agencies involved in trade. This would enable Lesotho to move towards a paperless 
environment for import/export related procedures and processes.  
 
This component would finance technical assistance, training, goods, works, and equipment. 
Indicatively, Subcomponent 1A would be US$ 1.3M, Subcomponent 1B (formerly part of 1A) 
would be US$ 0.03M, Subcomponent 1C (formerly 1B) would be US$ 1.7M, and Subcomponent 
1D would be US$ 2.3M. 
 
Component 2: 
 
This component will continue to support economic diversification activities. 
 
In Subcomponent 2A, support would continue under the AF for investment promotion and 
fostering increased linkages to the local economy. The AF would additionally support: (i) the 
reorganization of the LNDC, including implementation support for the resulting entity(ies); (ii) 
the development of a Private Sector Development Strategy; and (iii) the scaling up of a linkages 
program currently being piloted, including capacity building in the government to sustain the 
program.   
 
Subcomponent 2B will continue supporting the tourism sector, albeit in a different capacity given 
the complementarity with the AFDB project. Under the AF, support would be provided for: (i) the 
construction and management of the Tourism & Handicraft Information Center, which would 
provide information to tourists, offer retail space for fashion accessories and home decor 
products, and offer leisure and entertainment; and (ii) the development and implementation of a 
business plan for the handicrafts sector.  
Subcomponent 2C will continue supporting commercial horticulture by building out the value 
chain for fresh fruit produce and leveraging the private sector to scale-up production. The AF 
would additionally support:  
  
(i) Support for the existing commercial horticulture plots in order to render them commercially 
sustainable. 
 This includes upgrading the irrigation system; and developing and implementing a marketing and 
distribution strategy; among others.  
 
(ii) Development of a research and training center, to conduct applied research, including variety 
testing, and yield and performance monitoring, and to provide training on good farm practices, 
retail standards, and business skills to farmers in Lesotho. If adequately funded and governed, the 
research and training Center could take over many horticulture- related activities, currently 
managed by the PMU, when the Project ends. 
 
(iii) Development and implementation of a capacity building program for quality and standards, 
directed at farmers, trainers, auditors and GoL Officials.  
 
(iv) Integrate horticulture suitability maps with the master irrigation plans that are being 
developed for Lesotho.  
 



Page 6 of 12

(v) Support for financial institutions, to strengthen their capacity to effectively assess business 
plans, conduct due diligence, and gauge risks in the fresh fruit sector. After the initial assessment, 
support could be provided through LEAP. 
 
(vi) Support for a targeted investor attraction program, that clarifies at which levels of the value 
chain investors may seek to engage or invest, what the GoL expects from investors, and what 
potential investors can expect in return. This would include support for road shows in selected 
target markets, including South Africa and Kenya, among others. 
 
(vii) Support for agri-logistics, including a feasibility study for a packhouse, among others. LICP 
is embarking on an in-depth agri-logistics survey to identify technical and regulatory constraints 
from the field to domestic and international retailers, with a special emphasis on cross-border 
logistics and cold chains (storage and transport). The AF would consider supporting some of the 
recommendations, subject to financing availability. 
 
Subcomponent 2D will continue to support the management of the Lesotho Enterprise Assistance 
Program (LEAP) Program. A review of the systems and processes of LEAP will be carried out 
under the current project such that under the AF, the scope of the LEAP matching grants program 
can be expanded to include machinery and equipment. 
 
This component would primarily finance technical assistance, training, goods and works. 
Indicatively, Subcomponent 2A would be US$ 1.4M, Subcomponent 2B would be US$ 1.7M, 
Subcomponent 2C would be US$ 2.4M, and Subcomponent 2D would be US$ 0.5M. 
  
Component 3: 
 
This component will continue supporting the costs of the Project Management Unit, including the 
Monitoring and Evaluation system, and the management and implementation of the Environment 
and Social Management Plans (ESMP). To accommodate the larger scope of the PSCED-II 
Project under the AF, it is proposed that the PMU hire a Horticulture Coordinator, an Investment 
Climate / Business Environment officer, and a Communications Specialist. While the first of 
these is contemplated under the current project but has never been filled, the latter two positions 
would be new. A review of salaries is proposed to ensure PMU staff are paid competitively and 
according to their experience and performance.

II. Implementation
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements
Reflecting the multi-sector nature of the project, implementation arrangements are intended to offer a 
balance between the effective overall supervision and monitoring of the activities at the project level, 
as well as reinforcing the management and institutional responsibilities of individual sub-
components.  
 
Project Steering Committee (PSC): The PSC consists of members representing the agencies 
responsible for the project implementation i.e. the principal secretaries from the MTICM, MTEC, 
MAFS, MFLR, MoF, MDP, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, Town Clerk of the MCC, the 
Parliamentary Counsel, Master of High Court and the CEOs from LNDC and LTDC. The committee 
meets every semester to monitor the implementation progress of the project and help to resolve 
technical and implementation problems affecting project progress. Meetings are chaired by the 
Principal Secretary of MTICM. 
 
Project Management Unit (PMU): The day-to-day operations of the project are overseen by a Project 
Management Unit that is headed by a qualified Project Manager. In addition, the PMU includes a 
Financial Manager and a Procurement Manager who oversee the Financial Management and 
Procurement issues respectively. The PMU provides for overall fiduciary management, monitoring 
and evaluation, project oversight, and coordination. The role and functions of the PMU have been 
detailed in the Project Implementation Manual (PIM). The Project Manager is responsible for: (i) 
overall day-today management of the project, including coordination of procurement, financial 
management and M&E; (ii) coordination with all the implementing agencies responsible for the 
implementation of the various sub-components; and (iii) coordination with other donors and relevant 
programs/projects. The Project Manager reports to the Project Steering Committee chaired by the 
Principal Secretary, MTICM. The project covers the operating costs of the PMU, necessary 
equipment purchase, training of staff and the costs of annual audits of project accounts.

III. Safeguard Policies that might apply

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)



Page 8 of 12

Environmental Assessment 
OP/BP 4.01

Yes The Additional Financing to the Second Private 
Sector Competitiveness & Economic Diversification 
Project will maintain the Category B classification of 
the original loan. The environmental impacts of the 
AF are expected to derive mainly from the 
horticulture activities and the small-scale 
construction works related to the Tourism Handicraft 
Center which were assessed in the original loan. 
Potential minor to moderate adverse impacts are 
being managed and monitored through Global GAP 
certification for the horticulture sub-component, and 
through the provisions of the Environmental and 
Social Management Framework (ESMF) prepared 
for the horticulture sub-component and the 
Environmental and Social Management Plan 
(ESMP). Both instruments where prepared in 
anticipation that the project will scale up horticulture 
production in Lesotho, and was therefore designed 
for the Government of Lesotho to use post PSCED-II 
Project. Given the nature and scale of the project, the 
environmental impacts are expected to be generally 
limited to the sites and can be addressed with known 
mitigation measures included in the ESMF 
 
Environmental safeguard implementation 
arrangements will follow the arrangements that are 
already in place for the parent project. Activities to 
be carried out under the proposed Additional 
Financing (establishment of nurseries and a research 
center) are derived from continuity of the current 
project, and therefore the Additional Financing will 
not trigger additional safeguards policy.

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No The project will not support activities that will affect 
natural or critical habitats.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No The projects will not support activities located within 
forested areas or plantations as defined under OP 
4.36.

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes While the total land under the project is not 
substantial (only 30-35 hectares) and the risk of 
pesticides is minor to moderate due to the small 
amounts of pesticides being used, the ESMF 
incorporates an integrated pest management plan 
(IPMP). The application of fertilizers and pesticides 
will consider soil type and slope to ensure protection 
of watershed and groundwater. Application of 
pesticides and fertilizers will follow sustainable 



Page 9 of 12

approaches described in the Integrated Pest 
Management Plan (IPMP) for the parent project and 
monitored under the Global Gap framework. The 
subscription to Global Gap ensures that the project is 
compliant with international norms in the use and 
handling of agrochemicals. The horticulture 
coordinator will monitor erosion, water quality and 
soil nutrition, but with the 
Global Gap the project has enhanced inspection with 
an independent monitoring regime.

Physical Cultural Resources 
OP/BP 4.11

No While the project will finance minor construction 
works related to the Tourism Handicraft Center that 
will provide information on tourism sites, including 
physical cultural resources, the AF will not have 
direct impacts on physical cultural resources.

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 
4.10

No There are no Indigenous Peoples identified in the 
project areas.

Involuntary Resettlement OP/
BP 4.12

No The Tourism Information & Handicraft Center will 
be built on land on which there are no encroachers or 
squatters. A shortlist of potential sites has been 
developed for the tourism center and all shortlisted 
sites are held by public entities. Activities under the 
project will avoid any potential involuntary 
resettlement impacts and will ensure that if land 
acquisition is necessary, it will be carried out in a 
fully voluntary nature. Given that risk of involuntary 
resettlement impacts is low, the ESMP will include 
land acquisition screening criteria in order to ensure 
that involuntary resettlement impacts are avoided.

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No The project will not finance construction or 
rehabilitation of dams, nor will it rely on the 
performance of an existing dam or a dam under 
construction, as defined in the policy.

Projects on International 
Waterways OP/BP 7.50

No The project will not affect international waterways.

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/
BP 7.60

No The project will not finance any activities located in 
any known areas under territorial dispute as defined 
in OP 7.60.

IV. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify 

and describe any potential large scale,  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
There are no large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts anticipated from the project since 
the project will mainly be providing technical assistance to the GoL in Maseru, and only sub-
components 2B and 2C will support the tourism sector and horticulture, respectively. Potential 



Page 10 of 12

minor to moderate potential adverse impacts are being managed through Global GAP certification 
for the horticulture subcomponent, and through the provisions of the ESMP and ESMF prepared 
for the sub-components, respectively.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities 
in the project area:
There are no potential indirect and/or long term impacts envisaged in the project area.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts.
N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The AF will benefit from the institutional arrangements established under PSCED II Project. In 
anticipation of potential adverse impacts that could arise from construction of the Tourism 
Handicraft Centre, an ESMP has been prepared, and for implementation of the horticulture 
subcomponent, an ESMF has been prepared.  
 
All institutions that will be involved have implemented bank projects previously or are currently 
involved in implementation of other programs. As such they are familiar with World Bank 
safeguards and have gained experience in the implementation and oversight of Bank projects.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders include: (i) the Ministry of Trade and Industry, which provides guidance to 
the PMU; (ii) The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, which provides support to the 
Ministry of Trade and Industry; (iii) The Ministry of Forestry, which provides guidance to the 
project on matters related to technical on-farm activities; (iv) The Project Steering Committee, 
which consists of the principal secretaries from the MTICM, MTEC, MAFS, MFLS, the Central 
Bank, Registrar General and CEOs from LNDC and LTDC; (v) The National Environmental 
Secretariat (NES), the environmental agency responsible for reviewing and clearing all safeguards 
documentation for the project; (vi) operators in the handicraft sector in Lesotho who were 
consulted during the preparation of the ESMP for the Tourism Handicraft Center to be constructed 
in Maseru; (vii) the current participating farmers in the horticulture industry who have been 
consulted during the preparation of PSCEDP II as well as ESMF preparation; and (viii) the 
Lesotho Revenue Authority (LRA), which will be the beneficiary of activities relating to the 
Project's new trade facilitation & logistics subcomponent.

B. Introduction and Context  
 
Country Context  
Benin is one of the world’s least-developed countries, with an annual per capita income of approximately US$830 in 
2017.  Poverty remains widespread, with a poverty rate of about 50 percent (US$1.90 a day poverty line – 2011 
purchasing power parity) in 2016. With an average per capita gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 1.4 percent 
(2007-2016) driven primarily by the services sector, poverty reduction has been limited, highlighting the need to ensure 
a broad-based and stronger growth. There are significant regional disparities in poverty rates and rural poverty rates 
are higher than those in urban areas. Fewer female-headed households fall below the national poverty line than male-
headed households. However, women continue to suffer from a lack of economic opportunity and are under-
represented in politics and in other high-level decision-making positions. 
 
The macroeconomic policy framework provides an adequate basis for the proposed operation. This assessment is 
affirmed by favorable medium-term growth prospects underpinned by continued strength in agricultural production 
and sustained investments. It is further strengthened by the Government commitment to meet the 2019 West African 
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) fiscal deficit target; and the participation to the WAEMU and the prudent 
monetary policy at the union level. The Government macroeconomic and fiscal framework is supported by an 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) External Credit Facility (ECF) supported program which aims to address Benin’s 
balance of payments needs, and alleviate the impediments to inclusive growth and poverty reduction by creating fiscal 
space for infrastructure investment and priority social spending.  While public debt has risen in recent years, the results 
of the external debt sustainability analysis (DSA) show that Benin’s debt dynamics are sustainable, facing a moderate 
risk of debt distress. 
 
The operation supports Benin’s efforts to strengthen fiscal management; increase agricultural productivity and 
strengthen the financial viability of the power sector; and improve equitable access to education and health services.  
The introduction of a Policy Based Guarantee (PBG) as a part of the second operation aims to improve debt 
management.

Relationship to CPF 
 
DPFs are a key instrument in the World Bank’s ongoing policy dialogue with the Government of Benin and its 
development partners. The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY13-17 (Report No. 75774-BJ) noted the importance 
of relying on a combination of development policy and investment operations in order to encourage a coherent 
approach to supporting structural reforms. The new Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for FY19-FY23 explicitly 
includes the current DPF series as a key IDA instrument for supporting Benin's structural transformation for 
competitiveness and productivity and notes that development policy operations (including the proposed operation) will 
target domestic revenue reforms designed to reduce Government reliance on revenues generated from imports 
informally re-exported to Nigeria.  Furthermore, the recently completed PLR, which extended the CPS for an additional 
year, and the forthcoming Country Partnership Framework (CPF 2018-2023) identified the need for new investments 
and reforms in agriculture as a priority – an area supported under this series. 
 
The success of Benin to attain the WBG twin goals in the coming years is highly dependent on its capacity to promote 
private sector development, which is the most efficient channel to create jobs and to reduce poverty. Achieving this 
goal will require an increase in the productivity of the agriculture sector and also require a regular and affordable supply 
of electricity, which is frequently noted as a leading constraint to private sector growth, particularly in the light 
manufacturing and agricultural processing sectors.  The DPF series aims at supporting the Government in its efforts by 
focusing on two main objectives. The first is to increase the productivity of the agricultural sector through a series of 
measures aimed at developing high value chains and improving the quality of agricultural products. The second 
objective is to strengthen the power sector financial viability and the reliability of electricity supply, which is consistently 
viewed as one of the key constraints by firms operating in Benin. 
 

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s) 
 
The proposed operation supports Benin’s efforts to strengthen fiscal management; increase agricultural productivity 
and strengthen the financial viability of the power sector; and improve equitable access to education and health 
services. 

 
Key Results  
 
The measures supported by this DPF series are expected to strengthen fiscal management; increase agricultural 
productivity and strengthen the financial viability of the power sector; and improve equitable access to education and 
health services. The measures supported by the first pillar are expected to strengthen fiscal management by having a 
positive impact on tax compliance and revenue mobilization and by strengthening human resource management and 
promoting more efficient wage spending. The measures supported by the second pillar will have a short-term impact on 
technology for food processing, quality of agricultural products, and their market access; and a medium-term impact on 
the productivity of the agriculture sector. In addition, they will strengthen the country’s power sector financial viability by 
increasing the energy utility revenues and reducing arrears in the sector. Finally, the measures supported by the third 
pillar will are expected to improve access to education and health services in an equitable manner through a more effective 
deployment of newly recruited education and health personnel. 
 

D. Project Description

Benin Second Fiscal Reform and Growth DPF (P166115)

In the context of rising public debt, this series supports stronger fiscal management (Pillar 1) through measures to 
increase revenue and use public resources efficiently. In the run-up to the 2016 Presidential elections, uncontrolled 
increases in the wage bill and off-budget expenses led to significant increases in public debt (by almost 20 percent of 
GDP) and in the fiscal deficit (from 1.9 percent of GDP in 2014 to 8 percent in 2015, including grants).  The fiscal deficit 
was reduced from 8 percent of GDP in 2015 to 5.9 percent in 2017 by containing public spending. The DPF series 
supports the authorities’ efforts to strengthen fiscal management by improving revenue collection and by managing 
public expenditure more efficiently, particularly wages and transfers. 
 
Increasing agricultural productivity and value addition and strengthening the power sector’s financial viability (Pillar 
2) is a Government’s priority. Addressing the challenges of the agriculture and power sectors is key to promote private 
sector development, which is the most efficient way to create jobs and to reduce poverty. Agriculture employs about 
50 percent of the population and is the economy’s leading formal sector foreign exchange earner. The country has a 
large endowment of arable and fertile land and adequate water resources. However, Benin’s comparative advantage in 
agriculture remains largely unexploited. The sector’s productivity can be improved, once deficiencies in the agriculture 
policy framework and governance structure are addressed and constraints to farming, such as limited access to input 
and output markets and food safety and quality are tackled. As for the power sector, the inconsistent supply of 
electricity is noted as a leading constraint to private sector growth, particularly in the light manufacturing and 
agricultural processing sectors. Strengthening the financial viability of the power sector is essential to increase 
electricity production capacity in a fiscally sustainable manner.  
 
A new third pillar will support to the reforms necessary to improve access to education and health services. This pillar 
is consistent with the new national development strategy that emphasizes the need to strengthen the delivery of social 
services with. While access to education and health care has improved over the last decade, it varies considerably across 
income groups and locations. A key challenge is the disparity in the allocation of primary school teachers and key health 
care staff (doctors, nurses and midwives) across regions, with a relatively low number of them allocated in poor and 
marginal areas of the country.  
 
The introduction of a Policy Based Guarantee (PBG) as a part of the second operation aims to improve debt 
management. The PBG is expected to partially guarantee a Euro-denominated commercial loan extended by 
international commercial banks at more favorable terms than existing CFA-denominated short-term debt. The PBG 
would support the Government’s debt management strategy which aims at increasing the diversification of public 
borrowing and reducing refinancing risks by extending tenor. The Government has expressed its intention to use the 
proceeds of the commercial loan to prepay existing and more expensive short-term debt accumulated on the domestic 
and regional markets. This would reduce the Net Present Value of public debt and lead to reduced interest payments 
over time.

The Ministry of Economy and Finance is responsible for overall implementation of the proposed FRG series. The 
ministry’s Monitoring Unit for Economic and Financial Programs (Cellule de Suivi des Programmes Economiques et 
Financiers – CSPEF) leads the Government's technical team, with additional representatives from sector ministries 
participating as required. The Government has determined that the monitoring and evaluation of the DPF series and 
other externally financed budget-support operations will be based on performance indicators and targets set out in 
sector program budgets. Sector ministries collect data and transmit it to CSPEF, which analyses the data and produces 
periodic reports. This framework, which builds on the mechanism put in place for Benin’s PRSPs, supports the coordinated 
action and synergies between stakeholders involved in the monitoring and evaluation of the Government’s strategy and 
the provision of donor support. The donor community and the Government have agreed to an annual review process 
that includes quarterly review meetings, additional meetings on special subjects as needed, a mid-year progress review 
on the previous year’s aide memoire, individual sector reviews, a joint donor-government review mission and the 
preparation of a new aide memoire for the coming year. The World Bank is fully involved in this process, participating in 
and contributing to every element of it. 

 

F. Poverty and Social Impacts and Environmental Aspects 
 
Poverty and Social Impacts 
 

The FRG series is expected to have a positive impact on poverty reduction through different channels. Some of the 
measures supported will have a mostly indirect through stronger fiscal managemnet, improved public spending efficiency 
and productivity gains as well as job creation in the agricultural and no-farm sectors. This impact has been strengthened 
by the inclusion of the third pillar on human capital development that could have both a direct and indirect influence on 
the level and distribution of poverty.  
 
Prior Actions 1,2 and 3 support measures to strengthen fiscal management. These measures are expected to facilitate 
the delivery of essential public services and to contribute to a macroeconomic environment conducive to economic growth 
and private sector employment creation. Prior actions 4, 5, and 6 focus on increasing agricultural productivity and 
contribute to the Government’s poverty reduction goals. In 2015, 60 percent of the rural population lived below the 
US$1.90 per day poverty line. Limited agricultural growth (around 3.5 percent per year, which is approximately the rate 
of population growth in the country) has weakly contributed to poverty reduction. The development of value chains and 
diversifying production into more valuable crops should boost incomes of households involved in agriculture.  Prior actions 
supported in the power sector pillar (Prior actions 7 and 8) promote reliable access to electricity and a more cost-
effective electricity provision and should have a direct and positive impact on the poor. Only 29 percent of Benin’s 
households have access to electricity, and due to the significant disparities between urban and rural areas, only 6 percent 
of the rural population has access to electricity. The measures supported under this series will support the financial 
viability of the power sector. Furthermore, access to electricity liberates non-paid family time demands, particularly for 
women and girls, and further increases quality of life and opportunities for investment in human capital, including in girls 
and women. Increased and more reliable access at affordable prices should also have a significant impact on firm creation, 
firm growth and resultant employment opportunities, particularly in the higher productivity formal sector.  Prior action 9 
supports equitable access to education services and is expected to have indirect positive effects on poverty reduction. 
Schools quality play a determinant role in education outcomes. Improving school quality (through lower pupil to teacher 
ratios) is likely to improve learning outcomes and increase grade attainment. As education outcomes improve for the 
poor, they will have better job opportunities that offer higher earnings and security.  Prior action 10 supports equitable 
access to health services through the deployment of new health workers to underserved areas. Providing affordable 
health care service to the poor remains a challenge in Benin particularly in the rural areas.  Addressing health care needs

 Page 7 of 8  

     

of the poor requires a multidimensional strategy integrating availability of health services, their quality, and financial 
accessibility.  
 
Environmental Aspects 
 

The reforms and policy actions supported by the proposed operation are not likely to have significant negative impacts 
on the country’s environment, forests and other natural resources. In addition, all the potential environmental and social 
adverse impacts associated with activities supported by the current DPF will rely on the existing National legal and 
regulatory framework and then, will be monitored and addressed through the national procedures in place in Benin.  Over 
the last 20 years, the Government has made significant strides in mainstreaming environmental sustainability in projects. 
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) is a legal requirement and it is widely applied to all developmental 
projects. Environmental assessment is a necessary condition to obtain the approval to implement any development 
project. It has been set up in Law N° 98-30 relating to the environmental framework and in Decree N° 2001-235 relating 
to the environmental assessment procedures. 
 
The prior action of strengthening the financial viability of the power sector is likely to produce climate change mitigation 
co-benefits since strengthening the financial viability of the sector is likely to promote the development of new energy 
efficient production capacities. In the agricultural sector, measures intended to diversify agriculture away from a reliance 
on cotton could have a potentially positive environmental effect as agriculture becomes less mono-culture based and 
increasingly diversified. 
 

G. Risks and Mitigation 

 
The overall risk level associated with this operation is substantial. Substantial governance, institutional capacity, and 
macroeconomic risks could adversely impact the PDO. Despite the substantial risk rating, staff believe that the potential 
benefits of the proposed operation outweigh the risks involved and warrant IDA’s assistance in proceeding with the 
operation and in implementing the critical reforms and policy actions supported by this operation, in coordination with 
other donors, along with appropriate risk mitigation actions.

B. Introduction and Context 

 
Country Context 

1. Guinea-Bissau is one of the most fragile countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, plagued by political 
turmoil and coup d’états since independence in 1974. Between 2000 and the present, the country has 
had 16 Prime-Ministers appointed to lead different Governments. The internal instability, often 
associated with problems in the political and military structure of the country, has prevented the 
formation of stable and accountable institutions and had devastating effects on the economy.   

2. The incidence of poverty is high, with over 69 percent of the population living below the poverty 
line (2011 PPP at US$1.90 per person per day), making it one of the poorest countries in the world. 
Poverty is more entrenched in rural areas where it is compounded by deprivation of social services, human 
capital, and infrastructure. Average real GDP growth, although modest, improved from 0.3 percent per 
year in 2013 to 6 percent per year in 20171, mainly driven by increased global demand for cashew nuts - 
the country’s main export crop. Per capita GDP is now estimated at US$780, although the Gini coefficient 
is high (sharply increasing from 0.35 in 2002 to 0.5 in 2010), pointing to high levels of inequality- with 
economic growth mostly benefiting the top income group. The country ranks 178th out of 189 countries 
on the 2019 United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Human Development Index, and thus falls 
under the low human development category. 

3. The impact of COVID-19 on the overall economy is expected to be severe. The main transmission 
channels include external (falling global cashew demand and price, tighter financial conditions, and low 
oil prices) reduced remittances, and domestic (economic disruptions caused by lockdowns and direct 
health impact of a wider spread of COVID-19). Health sector capacity is low and government effectiveness 
is weak. Guinea-Bissau has no fiscal and financial sector buffers to counter a sharp economic downturn, 
but it benefits from regional monetary buffers in the short-term. In the baseline scenario where 
lockdowns are short-lived, growth is projected to decline from 4.6 percent in 2019 to -1.5 percent in 2020 
and the fiscal deficit to increase from 5.1 to 6.2 percent. In the downside scenario, where lockdowns are 
sustained, growth would decline to -3.1 percent in 2020. The crisis could undo the modest gains made in 
poverty reduction2. 

 
1 Declined to 3.8 percent in 2018 due to a sharp drop in cashew production and somewhat lower international cashew prices.

4. Although Guinea Bissau has mineral resource endowments that could generate substantial 
revenues and greatly contribute to economic growth and development, agriculture is still the mainstay 
of the country’s economy. Over 80 percent of population relies on agriculture for their livelihood and the 
sector employs close to 70 percent of the country’s work force (most of whom are women)3. The sector, 
driven by cashew nut production, generates most - 95 percent - of the country’s foreign exchange, 17 
percent of fiscal revenues, and accounts for over 47 percent of GDP. 

5. Guinea-Bissau is one of the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change. Recent climate 
scenarios portend significant changes in the climate of Guinea-Bissau. These scenarios systematically 
signal increased average daily temperatures of up to +1.4°C for the period 2016-2045, potentially reaching 
up to +2.2°C in the 2046-2075 period, per a low emissions assumption. Under a high emissions scenario, 
the changes are in the order of +1.6°C to +3.1°C for the period 2046 to 2075. These changes are expected 
to lead to a dramatic reduction in rainfall, with serious implications on agriculture, especially production 
of rice, the main staple. 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

6. Agriculture (defined as crops, fisheries, livestock and forestry) is the dominant sector in the 
economy, contributing about 47.5 percent of GDP. Agriculture represents the primary source of income 
for 85 percent of the population and provides the livelihood for most of the poor. Within agriculture, the 
production and export of raw cashew nut is the dominant sector, acting as the main source of income for 
more than two thirds of households and for virtually all smallholders in the country. It also accounts for 
more than 95 percent of total export revenue and 17 percent of its fiscal revenues. High concentration in 
and dependence on cashew nuts exposes the country’s economy to both external and internal shocks on 
the sector.   

7. While the favorable ecological and climatic conditions render more than 60 percent of the total 
land area suitable for crop production, less than 12 percent is currently under permanent or seasonal 
cultivation. Years of instability destroyed household capacity as well as productive relationships, 
traditional markets, infrastructure, and social and economic institutions that support the sector. In 
addition, chronic public sector underinvestment in agriculture (less than 1 percent of GDP) undermines 
delivery of public goods and as a result, the sector is characterized by low productivity - with yields of key 
crops lagging behind those of the country’s regional peers (for example: 320 kilograms per hectare for 
cashew nuts compared to 520 kilograms per hectare in Cote d’Ivoire; and 1.7 tons per hectare for rice, 
compared to 4 tons per hectare in Senegal). Any increases in aggregate production have largely been 
achieved through area expansion, rather than improvements in total factor productivity and average 
annual sector growth has barely kept pace with population growth.  

8. A confluence of the comparatively superior benefits from cashew production (see Table 1), gaps in 
the land property law (which incentivize tree planting as a way of strengthening tenure security), and lack 
of an enabling environment4, has  over the last four decades, mediated a strong shift in the country’s 
agriculture production system towards cashew production.

employment-http://datatopics.worldbank.org/gender/country/guinea-bissau 
4 Including poor infrastructure, constrained access to inputs, technology, knowledge, markets, capital and availability of skilled 
labor.

9. From 14,000 ha in 1978, area under cashew cultivation has expanded at an average annual growth 
rate of 8 percent and now stands at 223,000 ha, which is about 56 percent of total area (about 400,000 
ha) under cultivation. Most farming households maintain a disproportionately higher share of their 
cultivated area under the perennial cashew, devoting the rest to food production- mainly rice, sorghum, 
millet, maize, peanut, and cassava. Farmers also use income from cashew sales to finance the purchase 
of agricultural inputs necessary to produce the food crops. 

10. Low average productivity5 and the already smaller acreage devoted to food crops, constrains, not 
only the production of amounts of food crops enough to meet farming households’ food requirements, 
but also the generation of marketable surpluses that could feed into the domestic market. 
Consequently, most farmers are also net food buyers and yet again use cashew nut proceeds to meet, in 
some cases up to 6 months of their food needs. Because of insufficient domestic production, the country, 
as a whole, relies on imports to bridge the gaps in domestic production. These food imports are mostly 
financed by forex revenues accruing from cashew exports. 

11. Guinea Bissau’s food security is therefore intimately tied to the cashew nut sector and any market 
volatilities or shocks to the cashew sector, are wired to have wide ranging implications on food security. 
The COVID-19 pandemic vividly spotlights these links. The country is now reeling from the effects of 
COVID-19 related cashew value chain disruptions on food security. Among others, due to stalled cashew 
sales: (i) most farmers cannot access necessary input and now face the dire prospect of not engaging in 
the forthcoming food crop growing season; (ii) those who rely on cashew sales and wages from the cashew 
value chain to meet some of their food security requirements are already experiencing challenges in 
accessing food; and (iii) food imports required to fill the demand gaps, are expected to be constrained by 
the limited foreign exchange reserves as a result of both the delayed cashew sales as well as the expected 
lower prices. The prevailing political uncertainty exacerbates these food security challenges. 

12. Government strategies acknowledge the risk posed by the high concentration in and high 
dependence of the economy on a single commodity. Within its limited resource and capacity constraints, 
the Government has been increasingly intentional in supporting more diversified agricultural production 
to wean the country off the raw cashew nut sector. The Government, with support from the World Bank 
Group has also supported the emergence of a cashew processing industry to reduce marketing risks and 
to help the country capture a larger share of final cashew prices through value addition. In the specific 
case of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Government has made available about US$0.65 million to help 
16,359 agricultural households to access input for the coming cropping season. There are also ongoing 
discussions with the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) for a US$43.8 million project 

 
5 Mainly due to limited access to advisory services, inputs, technologies, financing, and poor physical infrastructure.

targeting diversification of production (some of the proceeds of which could go towards supporting 
increased food production in the short to medium term), as well as the African Development Bank for 
assistance with responding to the food security challenge and to support the cashew campaign. In 
addition, the Government also used the WAEMU/Central Bank facility to borrow FCFA 15 billion to support 
the cashew marketing campaign implemented through an MOU with the five locally based commercial 
banks. This operation contributes to these  efforts and will focus on: (i) provision of agricultural input 
(seed, fertilizer, small equipment, and labor) necessary to engage in food production in the short term; 
(ii) provision of a community safety net tied to a public works program; and (iii) developing market risk 
reduction strategies for the raw cashew nut sector. 

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

13. The objectives of the project are: (i) to support increased food crop production; and (ii) increase 
access to food for consumption by food insecure households in Guinea Bissau. 

Key Results 

14. The Project is expected to: (i) reach 50,000 farming households with agricultural assets or services; 
(ii) contribute to the production of 205,000 metric tons of food crops; and (iii) provide immediate 
conditional cash support to 10,000 poor beneficiaries through participation in public works (cash-for-
work). Overall, the Project is expected to reach 378,000 beneficiaries, at least 50 percent of whom will be 
women. 

D. Project Description  
 

15. The proposed project seeks to urgently support the government of Guinea Bissau to proactively 
mitigate the short-to-medium-term food security challenges that the country is expected to face, as result 
of COVID-19 impacts on cashew nut production and marketing and on food production and prices. In 
addition, financing will be provided to strengthen the resilience of the cashew sector to market risks.  The 
project will be organized around five components as described below. 

Component 1: Support to Agricultural Production (US$10.0 million) 

16. The objective of this component is to support an accelerated supply response focused on 
preserving/restoring the productive capacity of 50,000 eligible farming households to enable them to 
effectively engage in continued and expanded production of key staple foods in the short - to medium -
term (6-24 months). The project will finance: (i) procurement and distribution of improved seeds and 
planting materials, with a focus on key food crops and vegetables; (ii) access to necessary farm equipment 
and labor; and (iii) provision of requisite advisory services in support of improved production, productivity 
and production system resilience to climate change. Special focus will be provided to market gardening, 
an important farming activity in the urban and peri-urban areas, which is mainly a women’s vocation. 
Where deemed critical to household food security, the project will support livestock services, including 
vaccination, deworming, and disease management. In addition, support under this component will go 
towards promoting climate-smart agriculture (CSA) techniques and practices, drought-resistant seeds, 
and capacity-building of the farmers.  

Component 2: Support to Community Safety Nets (US$2.5 million) 

17. The COVID-19 pandemic shock on the cashew nut sector is expected to lead to job losses along the 
value chain.  The impact of these job losses is expected to be greater for the multitude of unskilled laborers 



 

The World Bank  
Guinea Bissau Emergency Food Security Project (P174336) 

 

 

  
 Page 7 of 10  

 

in the value chain, for whom the daily labor wages are the only source of income for household food 
security. The anticipated escalation in food prices (partly due to projected lower domestic production and 
higher import prices), is expected to amplify the shock on their household food security.  

18. Investment under this component is to ensure household food security for sections of the 
communities affected by job losses, by mitigating the expected shortfalls in their incomes through support 
for public works community-level works. This activity will target 10,000 beneficiaries, and its focus will be 
on establishing public assets that would contribute to or enhance the impact of support under Component 
1 as well as those that foster adaptation to climate change. These could include support to the distribution 
of inputs, rehabilitation of storage facilities, opening of access roads to agriculturally productive areas, 
public irrigation infrastructure, construction of local markets, rehabilitation of rice fields, etc. Presence of 
clear post operation maintenance mechanisms will be key in choice of public works to be funded to ensure 
sustainability. The daily wages for the cash-for-work activities will be below the local level for unskilled 
labor thus providing an ‘in-built” self-targeting mechanism for the conditional cash transfers that would 
also ensure that the public works do not compete with agriculture for seasonal labor. Where high levels 
of structural unemployment dictate against self-targeting, beneficiary selection will be guided by local 
leadership. Beneficiary selection would be sensitive to gender considerations. 

Component 3: Support to Risk Mitigation (US$1.5 million) 

19. The COVID-19 pandemic, has unveiled the significant vulnerability of Guinea Bissau’s economy to 
shocks, occasioned by high dependence on the quasi monoculture of a singular crop. While diversification 
is the ultimate panacea for this vulnerability, a number of ex-ante risk management measures (e.g. 
forward contracting, insurance, hedging, improved storage, etc.) as well as ex-post risk management 
instruments (e.g. contingent risk financing) can reduce the specific vulnerabilities of the cashew sector to 
market risks. The proposal is to explore the feasibility, and then pilot the implementation of locally 
appropriate market risk management measures for the cashew sector. This would serve to strengthen the 
resilience of the sector to market risks that the sector is increasingly exposed to (e.g. a price drop in 2018, 
current disruptions to the global supply chains) and would lay the ground for a sustainable recovery.  

Component 4:  Project Management (US$1.0 million).   

20. The objective of this component is to support MARD in facilitating   efficient implementation of 
project activities and tracking of results. The component will finance activities related to project 
coordination and management, including developing annual work plans and budgets, financial 
management (FM) and procurement, safeguards compliance, project monitoring and evaluation (M&E), 
citizen engagement as well as a Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM).    

Component 5: Contingent Emergency Response (US$0 million) 

21. This zero-cost, contingent emergency response component (CERC) will finance eligible expenditures 
in case of natural or man-made crises, disasters, severe economic shocks, or other crises and emergencies 
in Guinea Bissau. Implementation of this component will follow a detailed Contingent Emergency 
Response Implementation Plan (CERIP) satisfactory to the World Bank that will be prepared for each 
eligible crisis.

Summary of Assessment of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts 
. 

22. The project is expected to have positive impacts by targeting mitigation of food crisis due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic outbreak through the support of crop diversification, helping smallholders to find 
alternative income besides from cashew value chain production, provide a community safety net tied to 
public works program; and support market risk reduction for raw cashew nuts. As project locations are 
yet to be agreed upon, an Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) will be prepared 
covering environmental and social risks and impacts caused by the civil works, use of pesticides and 
fertilizers and generation of waste during the implementation of the project. The ESMF sets out the 
principles, rules, guidelines and procedures to assess the impacts from civil works provided by the project 
and help guide the preparation of site-specific (Environment and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) and 
Environment and Social Management Plans (ESMPs). It includes screening, measures and plans to reduce, 
mitigate and/or offset adverse risks and impacts, provisions for estimating and budgeting the costs of such 
measures, and information on the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) responsible for 
addressing project risks and impacts, including on its capacity to manage environmental and social risks 
and impacts of the project activities. The ESMF will include general Environment Health and Safety 
Guidelines (EHSGs), Good International Industry Practice (GIIP) and Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) 
measures for the identified sub-projects. In addition, a Pest Management Plan (PMP) will also be 
developed for proper handling and use of pesticides. The recipient will also prepare an Environmental and 
Social Commitment Plan (ESCP), with the support of the Bank. The ESCP will include the commitment and 
the timeline for the preparation of subsequent ESIAs. 

E. Implementation 
 

Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 
 

23. Project implementation will be the responsibility of MARD, through a Project Coordination Unit 
(PCU) to be set up in MARD with project support. The primary responsibility of this PCU will be: (i) ensuring 
coordination, timeliness and technical soundness of implementation; (ii) contracting of implementation 
support partners; (iii) monitoring implementation and reporting to the Bank. For these functions, the PCU 
will be staffed with a competitively selected Coordinator, Agricultural Specialist, Monitoring and 
Evaluation expert, Environment and Social Safeguards specialists, Procurement Specialist, Financial 
Management Specialist, as well as a Communication Specialist. The PCU will also work closely with 
technical staff from the relevant MARD directorates, to provide backstopping support to implementation. 
The relevant MARD staff will be identified as part of the assessment that would need to be conducted. As 
needs arise, other expertise would be hired into the MARD-PCU.  

24. Because of potential delays in establishing a functional PCU against a backdrop of the emergency 
nature of the operation, project implementation will start with the support of the Food and Agriculture

 Page 9 of 10  

 

Organization (FAO) which will manage Component 1 and Component 2 implementation in close 
collaboration with the MARD. In this context, FAO will support the sourcing and distribution of production 
inputs, provision of advisory services to beneficiary farmers, and identification of eligible beneficiaries 
under the cash-for-work activities, overseeing implementation of the cash-for-work activities and 
payments to beneficiaries. Similarly, project procurement and financial management will be initially 
delegated to the Project Implementation Unit of an on-going IDA-financed Safety Net and Basic Services 
Project (P163901), established within the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Regional Integration. Once 
the PCU under MARD is fully functional, it will take full charge of implementation, including for Component 
3 activities. 

25. A Project Steering Committee (PSC), chaired by the Minister, MARD (or his/her representative), will 
be established to provide general oversight of the project. The PSC will include representatives from the 
Ministries of Economy and Finance, Trade, Social Affairs, cashew sector stakeholders, FAO6, and other 
entities deemed relevant. The PSC will be responsible for providing overall implementation and policy 
guidance. The PSC will meet four times a year.

Other Decision (as needed) 
 
 
B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 

1. Zambia is a lower-middle-income country with close to 16 million inhabitants. It had a Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) of US$27.1 billion in 2015, equating to a per capita income of about US$1,300. Zambia 
has made significant socio-economic progress over the past two decades and achieved average growth 
of 7.4 percent between 2004 and 2014. However, since mid-2015 economic growth has slowed down 
considerably to 2.9% in 2015 and a forecasted 3.0 percent in 2016, as external headwinds and domestic 
pressures have intensified.  

2. In 2015, global economic conditions for growth deteriorated and the price of copper (typically 77 
percent of Zambia’s exports) fell further from its 2011 peak. This has put downward pressure on 
revenues, widening the fiscal deficit and reduced the value of exports, opening up a trade deficit. In 
addition, Zambia experienced domestic pressures in the form of: (i) repeat fiscal deficits (reducing 
confidence in the economy); (ii) reduced and delayed rainfall in 2015 (undermining agricultural incomes 
and lowering the water level in reservoirs); and (iii) increased power outages. Further, the strengthening 
of the US$ in 2015 put pressure on the Zambian Kwacha that combined with lower confidence so that 
the local currency lost 41% of its value against the US$. 

3. Close to the end of 2015 the government acted vigorously to contain the impact of ebbing confidence 
with monetary policy measures. These measures restored stability of the Kwacha, which appreciated by 
11.2 percent in the first 9 months of 2016, and helped curb inflation from its peak of 22.9 percent in 
February 2016 to 8.8 percent in November 2016. However, fiscal policy remained loose in 2016 and 
monetary policy has had to remain very tight, reducing liquidity, putting pressure on the financial sector, 
and causing a drag on growth.  

4. The August 2016 elections went in favor of the incumbent President and political party. After five 
elections in ten years the constitutional changes mean that a full five-year term is expected to be served, 
raising cautious optimism about the political space for reform in 2017 and over the medium-term. The 
Government has presented its economic recovery plan: “Zambia Plus” that provides a framework for 
restoring fiscal sustainability, closing the twin deficits and ensuring that structural reforms are carried 
out to boost the non-copper economy. The Government has requested the support of the World Bank, 
IMF and other partners to make it a success. Accordingly, GDP growth is forecast to rise to 4.0 percent in 
2017 and 4.2 percent in 2018. The forecasts are subject to upside and downside risks, but the return of 
investor confidence in the fourth quarter of 2016 (evidenced by over-subscribed bond auctions), bold 
measures by government (including the removal of fuel subsidies), and a rally in copper prices 
(November 2016), suggest that economic circumstances are improving.

5. The rapid and sustained growth achieved from the early 2000s to 2014 was insufficiently inclusive and 
despite the economy doubling in size, poverty remains widespread. As based on the 2015 Living 
Conditions Monitoring Survey Report of the Government’s Central Statistical Office, an estimated 54.4 
percent of Zambians live in extreme poverty (below US$1.90 per day, purchasing power parity terms) 
and poverty is higher among women. Rural poverty (at 76.6 percent) is more than three times the 23.4 
percent rate of urban poverty. The benefits of growth have accrued mainly to those already above the 
poverty line, inequality has remained high, and efforts are needed not only to restore the economy to 
faster growth, but ensure planned pro-poor policies are implemented and more inclusive growth 
follows. 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

6. In Zambia’s Eastern Province (EP), the majority of the province’s 1.7 million people live in rural areas 
with livelihoods dependent on natural resources. As in Zambia as a whole, this rural population is 
characterized by high levels of poverty and addressing this challenge is the highest priority of the 
provincial administration. According to the World Bank’s Mapping Subnational Poverty in Zambia report, 
the Eastern Province is one of three poorest provinces in Zambia

1
. In addition, according to the Living 

Conditions and Monitoring Survey (2015), at 70 percent, the Eastern Province had the fourth highest 
proportion of population that was poor. The Zambian diet is mainly composed of cereals, predominantly 
maize, starchy roots and, to a lesser extent, fruit and vegetables. Cereals provide almost two-thirds of 
the dietary energy supply. According to the 2013-14 Zambia Demographic and Health Survey, the 
nutrition indicators for Eastern province stand at 43 percent for children under five who are stunted and 
20 percent of the women are overweight or obese (ZDHS, 2013-14).  Women and children are the most 
vulnerable to the problems related to nutrition because of their socioeconomic characteristics.  

7. Compounding the challenges of rural development in the EP is a changing climate, which models suggest 
will continue to change dramatically over the coming decades. The country is already experiencing 
climate-induced hazards. Droughts and floods have increased in frequency and intensity over the past 
few decades and have adversely impacted food and water security, water quality, energy generation, 
and livelihoods of people, especially in rural communities. Recent climate trends based on records from 
1960 to 2003 indicate that the mean annual temperature increased by 1.3 degrees Celsius, an average 
rate of 0.34 degrees Celsius per decade. Mean rainfall in Zambia has decreased by an average rate of 1.9 
mm/month (2.3 percent) per decade since 1960. The future trends in the country are towards a higher 
average temperature, a possible decrease in total rainfall, and some indication of more intense rainfall 
events. Zambia’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) report to the UNFCCC has estimated 
national GDP loss due to climate change over a 10-20 year mid-term planning horizon will be in the 
range of US$4,330-5,440 million with the following sector GDP losses: agriculture (US$2,200 – 3,130), 
energy-related (US$270 – 450), health (US$460), and natural resources (US$1,400).  
 

8. In addition to being subject to the impacts of climate change, Zambia contributes to global carbon 
emissions. According to the Second National Communication (SNC), the latest data available from the 
UNFCCC, annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Zambia have increased by 6.2 percent from 51.52 
million tons carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 1994 to 54.72 million tons CO2e in 2000. The largest 
contribution to GHG emissions in 2000 came from land use change and forestry, which accounted for

73.7 percent followed by agriculture at 18.9 percent. 
 

9. Addressing rural poverty and improving livelihoods, helping rural communities adapt to major impacts 
to be expected from climate change, and reducing national carbon emissions from the forest and land 
sector all require a carefully integrated landscape approach. Major sources of rural livelihoods in the EP 
are in agriculture, forestry, and wildlife, but all of these are inter-dependent and all are intertwined with 
climate change adaptation and mitigation. 

 
10. The Government of the Eastern Province is in the process of preparing a development vision in 

consultation with provincial stakeholders. The vision statement is “to improve rural livelihoods in Eastern 
Province by reducing deforestation and forest degradation using a low emission pathway through local 
community participation by 2030”. In order to address the challenges associated with the drivers of 
deforestation, local communities’ participation and commitments as well as private sector involvement 
will be critical in optimizing natural resources management at both communal and individual farmer 
levels. According to the vision, the targets for reducing drivers of deforestation include reducing the 
total annual area burnt from 16.7 percent to 5.0 percent by 2036 through forest fire management; 
establishment of a minimum of 3,000 hectares of plantations on deforested land by 2037; promoting 
ecotourism with community participation to combat poaching; and promoting soil fertility 
improvement, good agricultural practices, and land use planning among 40 percent of the farmers in the 
province to tackle food security and poverty at local level. The estimated financing investment to 
achieve these goals is US$140 million, part of which will be leveraging private sector investments and a 
significant part of which will be mobilization of additional financing for institutional strengthening and 
implementation of activities. The ZIFLP will contribute towards supporting activities for addressing the 
drivers of deforestation as stated in the vision. 
 

11. Institutionally, responsibilities for coordination of the national climate agenda falls to the Interim 
Climate Change Secretariat (ICCS), under the Ministry of National Development Planning (MNDP). The 
ICCS ensures coordination with the many other ministries and organizations which need to be engaged 
in a landscape-level livelihoods/climate change initiative such as this project. Responsibility for 
implementing projects is often with the line ministries. At the provincial level, the provincial 
administration of the Eastern Province exercises considerable control over activities in its jurisdiction, 
consistent with the recently adopted decentralization law of Zambia.

Key Results 
 

13. The achievement of the PDO will be measured using the following indicators i) Forest area brought 
under sustainable management practices as a result of the project (ha); ii) Land area under climate-
smart agricultural practices (ha); iii) Yield change for selected crops (%); and iv) People in targeted 
communities with increased monetary and non-monetary benefits (% share of which women). The 
project outcome and intermediate indicators are presented below in the Results Framework. 

 
D. Project Description  
 

14. The project aims to provide support to rural communities in the EP to allow them to better manage the 
resources of their landscapes so as to reduce deforestation and unsustainable agricultural expansion; 
enhance benefits they receive from forestry, agriculture, and wildlife; and reduce their vulnerability to 
climate change. The project must also invest in ensuring that enabling conditions are in place for these 
changes to happen – conditions such as tenure security, planning at different spatial scales, and capacity 
development. Simultaneously the project will create the enabling environment for emission reduction 
purchases to be made in a subsequent project. 

 
15. ZIFLP will promote the adoption of sustainable landscape management practices and climate-smart 

agriculture (CSA) as an alternative. Community empowerment, strengthening local and traditional 
governance and land use planning are the key to integrating, optimizing multiple land uses within the 
landscape. However, collective action is unlikely in the absence of rights to use, benefit from, and 
protect natural resources. Leverage for transforming the system will include village land use plans, 
improved governance, matching land use with land characteristics, and poverty reduction outcomes 
including emission reduction payments. This will require strong monitoring systems for 
livelihoods/economics, governance, the implementation of land use plans, and resources monitoring 
and protection. 

 
16. ZIFLP would finance activities under four components over a five-year period using funds from the 

BioCFplus-ISFL (US$8.0 million), GEF (US$8.05 million) and IDA (US$17.0 million). The project 
components include 1) Enabling Environment, 2) Livelihood and Low Carbon Investments, and 3) Project 
Management. A fourth component, with a zero budget, is included in the event funds need to be 
reallocated for an emergency response. 
 

17. Component 1: Enabling Environment. This first component is intended to help create conditions that 
will allow the livelihood investment of Component 2 to be successfully implemented. This entails 
supporting plans, partnerships, and regulatory conditions to help rural communities in the project area 
to have the capacity to adopt sustainable and low-carbon land management practices. The component 
would include support for (i) Developing integrated district development and local planning; and (ii) 
Establishing emissions reduction framework leading to an Emission Reduction Payment Agreement 
(ERPA) (for future results-based emissions reduction payments). Enabling environment interventions will 
be financed through grant support from the BioCarbon Fundplus-ISFL. 
 

18. Component 2: Livelihood and Low-Carbon Investments. Component 2 will finance on-the-ground 
activities that improve rural livelihoods, conserve ecosystems and reduce GHG emissions. It has 2

subcomponents: Agriculture and forestry management and Wildlife management. These activities will 
be financed by IDA, BioCFplus-ISFL and GEF resources. Although the subcomponents are sectoral in 
nature, the cross-sectoral and landscape approach of the planning activities that will underlie the 
activities will ensure a landscape approach is retained.  

 
19. Agriculture and forestry management. The objective of this subcomponent is to provide financing for 

interventions that increase agricultural productivity, enhance agro- and forest ecosystem resilience, 
reduce GHG emissions, and sequester carbon using a landscape approach. This subcomponent will cover 
the following activities: (i) scaling up of climate-smart agricultural practices; (ii) community forestry 
management; and (iii) land tenure and resource rights regularization, a pre-condition for the adoption of 
improved agriculture and forestry management. 

 
20. Climate smart agriculture. Interventions under climate smart agriculture will apply a train the trainers 

approach to introduce (i) conservation agriculture (CA) practices and integrated soil fertility 
management, (ii) agroforestry, and (iii) enhanced market access for smallholders and private sector 
engagement. In addition, the project supports community matching grants which can support livelihood 
interventions including climate-smart agriculture interventions, introducing small ruminants or poultry, 
supporting market access through agro-processing. Interventions will aim at enhancing the income and 
livelihood of the communities and farmer families through income generating and value added activities 
in the Eastern Province.  

 
21. Community forestry management. The objective of forestry management is to assist local communities 

and their organizations to improve the management and conservation of their natural resources, create 
income opportunities, and generate carbon benefits. This will be accomplished by developing and 
implementing participatory land and resource use planning and management–including fire control and 
prevention–and providing specialized technical assistance and training to identify viable investments 
from the sustainable production of timber and not-timber forest products. Activities to be supported 
will be consistent with the land and resource use plans developed at the village and district levels. The 
sub-component would finance specialized technical and extensions services, small works and 
equipment, operational costs and non-consultant services (e.g. workshops and study tours).  
 

22. Land tenure and resource rights regularization. The sub-component will provide analytical and 
technical assistance support to expand past and ongoing efforts at documenting land rights that could 
underpin adoption of sustainable low-carbon land management practices and private sector 
engagement.  Activities will feed into the National Land Titling Program, and will comprise (i) developing 
cost-effective systems to sustainably manage information on land rights and linking it to land use; (ii) 
identifying new possibilities of private sector engagement based on an assessment of the extent and 
impact of existing arrangements; (iii) documenting different types of land rights in ways that are 
supported by local stakeholders, and provide incentives for adoption of CSA, sustainable land use and 
intensification; and (iv) linking land rights to key parameters of land use (crop cover, soil moisture, soil 
carbon) using remotely sensed imagery.  

 
23. Wildlife management. This sub-component will have two major focus areas: i) improved management of 

the complex of protected areas centered on Lukusuzi National Park in the Eastern Province; and ii) 
adoption of improved management practices of wildlife at the community level, which can contribute to 



 
The World Bank  
Zambia Integrated Forest Landscape Project (P161490) 

 

 

  
Dec 22, 2016 Page 8 of 18  

 

improved livelihoods of targeted communities. The project will support (i) preparation of park 
management plans; (ii) investments in infrastructure such as guard houses or other park buildings, 
upgrading of existing roads and tracks to facilitate park management and ecotourism, provision of water 
holes, fencing (only in limited areas where judged necessary to minimize human-wildlife conflict, HWC); 
(iii) purchase of equipment such as radios for communication, park guard equipment, patrol equipment, 
etc.; and (iv) support to park patrols, with a particular focus on management of poaching. 

 
24. Component 3: Project management. This third component will finance activities related to national and 

provincial-level project coordination and management, including annual work planning and budgeting; 
fiduciary aspects (financial management and procurement); human resource management; safeguards 
compliance monitoring; M&E and impact assessment studies; and communication strategy and citizen 
engagement).   

 
25. Component 4: Contingent emergency response. This is a zero budget component which is included to 

facilitate the use of IDA funds in the event of a disaster and to be able to respond quickly to a potential 
government request to reallocate some funding from existing World Bank projects to provide 
emergency relief.  

 
E. Implementation 
 
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 
 

26. The major investments of the ZIFLP will take place in the Eastern Province. However, there are activities 
such as those related to REDD+ policy, MRV, safeguards, etc. which are national in scope. 
Implementation of ZIFLP will therefore be at both the national and at the Eastern Province level. A 
National Project Unit (NPU) will be responsible for activities at the national level, and will be located 
within the Ministry of National Development Planning. At the provincial level, the Provincial 
Administration of the Eastern Province will be the executing agency of the project. This implementation 
arrangement aims to: (a) ensure sectoral mainstreaming of investment; (b) lessen the approval layers 
for faster decision-making, enabling more efficient project implementation; and (c) respect the 
constitutionally mandated decentralization process and governance structures at the national and 
provincial levels, to the extent possible.  

 
 

 
 
 .    
F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 

Project location is the Eastern Province of Zambia. Wildlife conservation activities will focus on improved 
management of Lukusuzi National Park (and surrounding areas). The land planning, agriculture, and forestry 
investments will take place throughout the Province.

SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The policy is triggered as this is an integrated forest 
landscape project that will involve afforestation, 
reforestation, promotion of sustainable conservation 
farming methods as well as preservation of wildlife 
habitat in national parks and adjacent GMAs, all of 
which could have environmental or social impacts 
which must be assessed and managed. As a 
landscape management project its impacts are 
nonetheless expected to be overwhelmingly 
positive. 
 
The positive impacts of the program will be a 
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions with 
improved forest cover, rural livelihoods 
improvement, and wildlife conservation. The 
potential negative environmental impacts will be 
known with more specificity as project activities are 
identified during project implementation but are 
expected to be limited, localized, small-scale and not 
significant given that many of the on-the-ground 
project activities will be from community-driven 
development initiatives. An Environmental and 
Social Management Framework (ESMF) has been 
prepared to assess and guide the screening and 
mitigation of any negative impacts of the program. 
The project will monitor possible cumulative 
negative impacts and take action as needed. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

The policy is triggered given the potential impacts on 
natural habitats either directly or indirectly, through 
REDD+ activities, conservation farming, and the 
management of wildlife habitats. The expected 
impact on habitats is overall positive. Changes in 
livelihoods of rural farmers, due to increased 
agriculture activities and the introduction of new 



 

The World Bank  
Zambia Integrated Forest Landscape Project (P161490) 

 

 

  
Dec 22, 2016 Page 10 of 18  

 

agricultural technologies, are likely to have limited 
negative impacts on natural habitats. The proposed 
avoidance and mitigation measures for these 
impacts are included in the project's ESMF. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

The policy is triggered as the project forestry 
management activities seek to assist local 
communities and their organizations to improve the 
management and conservation of their forests. The 
project will have impacts on the health and quality 
of forests, will affect the rights and welfare of people 
and their level of dependence upon and interaction 
with forests, and aims to bring about changes in the 
management, protection, and utilization of natural 
forests. However, the project will not lead to 
significant conversion or degradation of critical 
forest areas or related critical natural habitats. There 
may be continuing intrusion of smallholder farming 
into natural forests in the project area but the 
overall purpose of the project investments is to limit 
such intrusions and never to promote them. The 
project's Environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF) and Process Framework (PF) 
address the potential impact of the project on 
forests and/or the rights and welfare of local 
communities. 
Since the project potentially finances harvesting 
activities carried out by local communities under 
community or even possibly joint forest 
management, such communities will adhere to a 
time-bound phased action plan to achieve a 
standard of forest management developed with the 
meaningful participation of locally affected 
communities, consistent with the principles and 
criteria of responsible forest management as 
outlined in paragraph 10 of OP 4.36. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The policy is triggered as increased agriculture 
activities and the adoption of new climate smart 
agriculture technologies could conceivably result in 
increased usage of agrochemicals by farmer 
beneficiaries. The project additionally will procure 
supplies and equipment for nurseries which may 
include pesticides. While a stand-alone Pest 
Management Plan (PMP) is not required for this 
project, the ESMF contains an abbreviated PMP to 
avoid usage of restricted pesticides, promote use of 



 

The World Bank  
Zambia Integrated Forest Landscape Project (P161490) 

 

 

  
Dec 22, 2016 Page 11 of 18  

 

personal protective equipment (PPE), training of 
producers in proper handling of agrochemicals, and 
to promote integrated pest management. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

The policy is triggered as a preventative measure in 
the event of potential impacts on the known and 
currently unknown physical cultural resources (PCR) 
of the area. The ESMF contains measures for 
avoiding and managing impacts on known PCR in the 
project area as well as chance-find procedures in the 
event new resources are discovered in the course of 
project implementation. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 

The policy is not triggered as the proposed program 
activities in the Eastern Province of Zambia are in 
areas that do not include indigenous groups as 
defined by the policy. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

OP 4.12 is triggered and applies mainly to certain 
activities relating to project interventions in 
protected areas. A Resettlement Policy Framework 
(RPF) was prepared in consultation with key 
stakeholders, consulted, and publicly disclosed. A 
Process Framework (PF) will also be required given 
that the project will support improved management 
of Lukusuzi National Park, adjacent GMAs and 
possibly other protected areas, thus potentially 
limiting access to resources. 
 
The PF is intended to avoid or minimize any adverse 
impacts upon local livelihoods and to support the 
development of alternative livelihoods as needed, 
on the lands already available to the affected 
households or communities. The project will support 
the preparation and implementation of follow-up 
action plans to provide livelihoods support where 
needed, following the criteria and procedures 
specified in the PF.  
 
The Zambian Government has recently resettled 
communities who encroached into Lukusuzi National 
park in the recent past. The Government has 
prepared and sent to the Bank a review of how the 
resettlements were carried out and an action plan to 
cover any remaining gaps that might remain. 
 
During the project, the Government could be 
required to continue to deal with those who have 



 

The World Bank  
Zambia Integrated Forest Landscape Project (P161490) 

 

 

  
Dec 22, 2016 Page 12 of 18  

 

already encroached into the park, or with new 
encroachers. If the project will in any way be 
associated with new resettlements, this would have 
to be done in strict accordance with the RFP. 
Additionally, the PF outlines the process of dealing 
with such situations following the Zambian laws, the 
provisions of the PF in accordance with OP 4.12, as 
well as international best practices.  
 
The Land tenure and resource rights regularization 
activities will be informed by and will be 
complementary to the PF and RPF as appropriate. 
 
All project-supported civil works (such as 
construction of office space, staff accommodations, 
and ranger posts) will be on government, public, or 
voluntarily donated community lands. This will be 
verified through the environmental and social 
screening mechanism specified in the ESMF, before 
any civil works commence. 
 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 

The policy on the Safety of Dams is not triggered as 
the project will not involve the construction of water 
retention structures that are likely to pose potential 
hazards to human or animal health and safety. The 
project will not fund any dams as defined in OP 4.37 
that would trigger the requirements of the policy. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 

The policy for Projects on International Waterways is 
not triggered as the proposed activities will not 
potentially impact any shared international 
waterway. Any conceivable increase in water use 
and direct abstraction of water resources in the 
Luangwa watershed will be of low significance and of 
local impact only. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
The Bank policy on Projects in Disputed Areas is not 
triggered by the project, as it is not located in any 
disputed territory of the country.

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
While there are environmental and social safeguard issues associated with the proposed project, no large-scale, 
significant, or irreversible negative impacts are foreseen. In general, the project is expected to generate positive, 
environmentally friendly land management practices including climate-smart agriculture and implementation of 
national park management plans. However, the project takes place in and could conceivably negatively impact natural 
habitats, protected areas, and forests. Additionally, as a project with an agricultural component, there are safeguard 
issues related to pesticide use. In all these cases, activities are largely community and demand-driven, and potential 
impacts are small-scale and localized. There may be cumulative impacts from these small-scale activities which will 
need monitoring. 
 
Zambia in the past has resettled persons illegally encroaching into national parks, including from Lukusuzi National 
Park, to be supported under the project. There could be possibilities of dealing with encroachment in the life of this 
project. The Government has conducted a review of how resettlement was carried out in the past in Lukusuzi NP as 
well as a gap analysis to identify any additional measures that may be needed to ensure compliance with both 
Zambian law and World Bank requirements. Any resettlement carried out during the project will be subject to the 
project's Resettlement Policy Framework. Additionally, the Process Framework (PF) outlines the process of dealing 
with limiting access to resources, following Zambian laws and the provisions of the PF in accordance with OP 4.12, as 
well as international best practices. 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
No negative long-term impacts are expected. As mentioned, a potentially indirect impact due to increased or new 
agricultural practices may be increased pesticide use but since such activities are largely community and demand-
driven, these issues are small scale and localized. The project will also support livelihood restoration activities and 
sustainable community forestry, which in turn is expected to be beneficial to the local communities. 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
In order to achieve the project objectives of promoting landscape management in the Eastern Province, in agricultural, 
forestry, and wildlife sectors, no project alternatives were identified that would further minimize environmental or 
social impacts and still allow for achievement of project objectives. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The borrower has developed an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF), a Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF), and a Process Framework (PF) in order to address safeguard policy issues. Specifically for issues 
related to the resettlement of encroachers out of Lukusuzi National Park, the Government has prepared a review and 
action plan. Although not related to potential impacts of the project activities, it should also be noted that the project 
includes significant funding to support the preparation of the safeguard instruments that will be needed to advance 
toward signature of an Emissions Reduction Purchase Agreement, in the context of REDD+. 
 
The Interim Climate Change Secretariat, under the Ministry of National Development Planning is currently 



 

The World Bank  
Zambia Integrated Forest Landscape Project (P161490) 

 

 

  
Dec 22, 2016 Page 14 of 18  

 

implementing the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) in the Western Province of Zambia. Hence, the 
implementation unit has good knowledge of safeguards and of implementation requirements. At present there is a 
knowledgeable Environmental and Social Safeguards Officer with proven experience with implementing management 
measures in line with World Bank safeguard policies. Safeguards capacity is much more limited or absent in the 
provincial administration unit; staff will need to be hired or training will need to be provided. Safeguards training 
needs have been identified in the ESMF, which would be provided through the technical assistance component of this 
project. 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Citizen engagement and participation for the project’s implementation will build on the various multi-stakeholder 
consultations that have taken place in the Eastern province during project preparation, and will take account of 
existing communication structures.  
 
Specifically, the project collaborates with stakeholders regularly through the following channels: project preparation 
missions, Monthly REDD+ Working Group meetings organized by the Interim Climate Change Secretariat and Forestry 
Department and Chipata Round Table meetings. The Chipata Roundtable was established to provide a forum for 
government and non-governmental stakeholders to discuss major environmental threats to the Luangwa Valley 
ecosystem, and is chaired by the Permanent Secretary, with active participation of chiefs and civil society. The 
Roundtable will likely be expanded to cover the entire Eastern Province. The ICCS will also develop a clear consultation 
and participation plan and protocols to be operationalized during implementation of this project, to ensure that all 
relevant stakeholders are targeted by the project.

I. Project Context
Country Context
Lake Victoria, with a surface area of about 68,800 km2, is the second largest freshwater body in the 
world. It is a transboundary resource shared by Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. Rwanda and Burundi 
are a part of the upper watershed that drains into Lake Victoria through the Kagera river. Its 
catchment area of 194,000 km2 is shared by five countries: Burundi (7 percent), Kenya (22 
percent), Rwanda (11 percent), Tanzania (44 percent), and Uganda (16 percent). The Lake is also 
part of the Nile River basin system, shared by ten countries: Burundi, the Democratic Republic of 
Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda. The population of

the Lake Victoria Basin (LVB) is about 35 million people, and it represents approximately 30 
percent of the total inhabitants of the East African Community (EAC) Partner States – Burundi, 
Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Kenya. 
 
Lake Victoria is a major population and poverty center in AFR, and a trans-boundary natural asset 
of global importance. The Basin is home to around a third of those below the poverty line in the 
East African Community, living on around a ninth of its land surface.  The Lake supports the 
world’s largest freshwater fishery, with a total annual landed catch value estimated at around US
$0.5 billion, supporting the livelihoods of 3 million people, providing roughly 0.5 million tons of 
fish to local markets and generating US$0.25 billion in export revenues. The establishment of the 
Nile Perch fishery in the 1980s and 1990s provided a resource boom that drew in poor and 
disadvantaged people from the neighboring countries. Large rural poor populations are also 
dependent on the degraded lands in the upper basin, particularly in Burundi, Rwanda and the Kenya 
highlands. In addition, the waters of the Lake and its catchment provide 90% of Uganda’s hydro 
power, most of the hydro power for Rwanda and Burundi, and the water supply to major urban 
centers including Kampala and Entebbe.  Protected areas cover 25% of the Basin’s land area and 
include some of the most renowned wildlife attractions in Africa – Serengeti and Volcanoes 
National Parks. 
 
The Lake Victoria Basin has also become a global example of environmental degradation. 
Historically, the introduction of the Nile Perch was associated with a mass extinction of native fish 
species, but Perch stocks have now themselves declined to probably less than half of their peak 
levels due to increased fishing efforts and other environmental stresses. Environmental degradation 
within the Basin increasingly poses broader threats to livelihoods and welfare. Erosion of soils has 
chronic impacts on agricultural productivity as well as acute impacts where gullies destroy land, 
property and even lives. The flow of sediments and other pollutants into the Basin’s rivers and 
ultimately the Lake reduces the supply of potable water, and causes algal blooms that are 
unpleasant for lakeshore communities and limit the tourism potential of the region. One of the most 
striking indicators of poor ecological health is the rapid colonization of the Lake by water hyacinth. 
Infestations of this invasive floating plant periodically block access to kilometers of lakeshore, 
preventing use of the Lake for transport and fishing, as well as posing serious health and safety 
risks to local inhabitants.  
 
LVEMP aims to tackle the environmental challenges of the Lake Victoria Basin over the long-term 
and basin-wide, to improve the welfare of its inhabitants. It was designed as a regional Series of 
Projects (formerly APL) with three envisioned phases and informed by the studies and lessons 
generated from the original Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project (LVEMP I), 
financed by the GEF and implemented from 1996 to 2005. APL-1 (now SOP-1), covering the three 
riparian states (Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda) as well as a regional coordination and policy 
component (through the EAC’s Lake Victoria Basin Commission, LVBC), is due to close at the end 
of FY15, having already received a 2-year extension. APL-2 (SOP-2), covering Rwanda and 
Burundi, started later and is due to close at the end of FY17. APL-3 (SOP-3) was envisaged to 
extend the program beyond the end of the first project of the series. 
 
The Additional Financing of the LVEMP is for implementation of additional or expanded activities 
that scale up the project’s impact, i.e. additional watershed management subprojects in existing 
focal areas, construction of sanitation and sewerage facilities that were designed but not 
implemented under the original project due to funding constraints, and expansion and deepening of 



Page 3 of 6

cleaner production programs. The additional Additional financing Financing represents roughly 
20% of the original project financing, but is expected to increase most of the key quantitative 
results by around 30-40%. Under the Additional Financing Kenya and Tanzania will each receive 
US$10 million IDA credits, and a US$2 million IDA grant for regional activities under LVBC: 
Credit Nos 4530-TZ, 4531-UG, 4532-KE; GEF grant TF-94205, SIDA grant TF-95196). Pending 
donor approval, an additional grant of US$ 0.5 million from the Cooperation in International 
Waters in Africa trust fund is anticipated, of a total Additional Financing amount of US$ 22.5 
million.

  

Sectoral and institutional Context
The Lake Victoria and its ecosystems support a number of sectors important for economic and 
livelihood development in the Lake Victoria Basin: Fisheries - the Lake fishery contributes to the 
GDP of the riparian countries and provides employment for about 197,000 fishers and 
approximately 600,000 fish traders; Transport - the marine transport provided by the Lake is very 
important for supporting the trade and economic development of the LVB countries; Energy - the 
Lake is the source of hydropower in Uganda generating power exceeding a value of US$350 
million per annum; Water - Approximately five million people living in the major cities and towns 
around the Lake, depend on Lake Victoria for their domestic and industrial water supply.  
 
Governance of the Lake occurs at the regional scale through the East African Community and Lake 
Victoria Basin Commission (LVBC) under the auspices of the Protocol on Sustainable 
Development of the Lake Victoria Basin, and at the national scale by the country governments of 
the LVB through implementation of respective national strategies. Accordingly, the project 
implementation arrangements are based on a two-prong institutional set up provided in the Protocol 
on the Sustainable Development of the LVB, i.e. at the EAC/regional and at national levels. 
 
The Regional Policy Steering Committee (RPSC) - comprising permanent secretaries of various 
line ministries - serves as the EAC coordination committee for LVEMP II (and other regional 
projects in the Basin), and the LVBC serves as the secretariat for the RPSC. National Policy 
Steering Committees (NPSCs) are responsible for the sectoral coordination at the national level and 
for providing operational policy guidance in each country. National Focal Point Ministries 
(NFPMs) in each of the LVB countries serve as the secretariat for the NPSCs. NFPMs are 
accountable for the overall project implementation, which is carried out by National Project 
Coordination Teams in partnership with multiple key ministries and local government authorities.

II. Proposed Development Objectives
A. Current Project Development Objectives – Parent
The objectives of the Project are to contribute to: (i) the improvement of the collaborative 
management of the trans-boundarynatural resources of the LVB among the Partner States; and (ii) 
the improvement of environmental management of targeted pollutionhotspots and selected degraded 
sub-catchments for the benefit of communities who depend on the natural resources of LVB.

III. Project Description

Strengthening institutional capacity for managing shared water and fisheries resources
Comments (optional)
Activities under this component will focus on strengthening the existing institutions to improve the 
cooperative management of shared transboundary natural resources of the LVB. Its objectives are 
to: (i) improve the effectiveness of key regional and national institutions through harmonization of 
national policies, legislation, and standards; (ii) develop options for sustainable financing of the 
natural resources management interventions; and (iii) develop regional frameworks for the 
management of key transboundary natural resources – water and fisheries. The focus here is on 
capacity building of the regional, national, and local institutions responsible for coordination, 
research, management of resources, and enforcement of environmental standards.

Component Name
Point source pollution control and prevention
Comments (optional)
The main objective of this component is to reduce environmental stresses within the Lake and 
littoral zone, through the implementation of mitigation and prevention measures. It will finance 
investments aimed at reducing point sources of pollution in priority hotspots, identified during 
LVEMP I. These investments will complement on-going activities supported by other Bank-funded 
projects in water and sanitation. Major activities include (i) rehabilitation and improvement of 
wastewater treatment facilities; (ii) promotion of cleaner production technologies; and (iii) pollution 
risk management and safety of navigation.

Component Name
Watershed management
Comments (optional)
This component seeks to reduce environmental stresses from the Lake basin, through the 
implementation of non-point sources pollution mitigation and prevention measures. The reduction of 
the non-point sources of pollution (sediment loads, nutrients, and agro-chemicals) by scaling up 
successful models of watershed management practices piloted under LVEMP I and other related 
national projects will improve water-use efficiency, and generate positive downstream externalities. 
Watershed management is being implemented through community-driven investments as a means of 
scaling up management efforts, and also building capacity and ownership at the local level for 
watershed management.

Component Name
Project coordination and management
Comments (optional)
This component will provide resources necessary for the effective coordination and communication, 
and monitoring and evaluation of the project activities. At the regional level, these tasks will be 
carried out by the RPCT mainstreamed in the LVBC, while at the national level they will be the 
responsibility of the National Project Coordination Teams (NPCTs). Activities under this 
component are divided into (i) project coordination and communication; and (ii) monitoring and 
evaluation.

Corporate Review Decision Proceed to Appraisal/Negotiations 

 

 Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement  
 
1. Benin is one of the world’s least-developed countries, with an annual per capita income of 
approximately US$820 in 2016. Poverty remains widespread, with a poverty rate of at about 50 
percent ($1.90 a day poverty line – 2011 PPP) in 2015.  With an average per capita GDP growth rate of 
1.3 percent (2005-2015) driven primarily by the services sector, poverty reduction has been limited, 
highlighting the need to ensure a broad-based and stronger growth. There are significant regional 
disparities in poverty rates and rural poverty rates are higher than those in urban areas. Fewer female-
headed households fall below the national poverty line than male-headed households.  
 
2. Benin’s economic growth has been satisfactory over the past decade (averaging about 4 percent) 
but the country’s economic performance has been hampered by low competitiveness and high 
informality.  Following the temporary slowdown experienced in 2015, economy activity rebounded 
driven by the recovery of private consumption. Economic performance was supported by increased 
cotton production, strong activity at the Port of Cotonou, and rising telecommunications and transport 
sector activity. Despite the satisfactory growth rates, economic performance in Benin is hampered by a 
weak business enabling environment. The high cost and unpredictable supply of electricity is a key 
constraint for private sector development. Agriculture’s export is concentrated in the cotton sector, and 
agriculture suffers from supply chain deficiencies, including in the provision and distribution of inputs as 
well as on the marketing side. Approximately 90 percent of the labor force is engaged in the informal 
sector – agriculture, informal commerce and other services activities. 
 
3. The first pillar of the Fiscal Reform and Growth series on fiscal consolidation is justified given the 
Government’s effort to create fiscal space and improve the efficiency of public spending. In the run-up 
to 2016 Presidential elections, increases in the wage bill and out-of-budget expenses led to significant 
increases in public debt (up by almost 20 percent of GDP) and in the fiscal deficit (up from 2.1 percent of 
GDP in 2014 to 8 percent in 2015). The Government contained expenditures in 2016 to face the drop of 
tax revenues and managed to reduce the fiscal deficit from 8 percent of GDP in 2015 to 6 percent of

GDP in 2016.  The DPO series will support the authorities’ effort to create fiscal space by improving 
revenue collection and managing more efficiently public expenditure, with an emphasis on wages and 
transfers.  In addition to the DPOs, the Government program is supported by an ECF program with the 
IMF approved by the IMF Board on April 7, 2017, providing macroeconomic and fiscal anchors that will 
support the implementation of the reforms. The first review of the Program, carried out in September 
2017, confirmed that the authorities are committed to responsible fiscal management. 

 
4. The second pillar aims at promoting agricultural productivity and strengthening the power sector 
which is a Government’s priority to create productive formal jobs and support inclusive growth. 
Agriculture employs over 50 percent of the population and is the economy’s leading formal sector 
foreign exchange earner. The country has a large endowment of arable and fertile land and adequate 
water resources. However, Benin’s comparative advantage in agriculture remains largely unexploited as 
the governance structure and relatively low food-safety standards had a negative impact on the sector’s 
competitiveness. Also, the inconsistent supply of electricity is frequently noted as a leading constraint to 
private sector growth, particularly in the light manufacturing and agricultural processing sectors. 
Strengthening the financial viability of the power sector and promote private sector participation is 
essential to increase electricity production capacity in a sustainable way. Focusing on these important 
real sectors will help improve productivity, create higher paying jobs and livelihoods, and enhance the 
country’s effort to reach the World Bank’s twin goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity. 
 

 Proposed Objective(s) 
 
5. The overarching goal of the proposed FRGC series is to boost real economic growth, reduce poverty 
and increase opportunities for the poorest in the population. The program development objectives of 
this FRGC series are to: a) support macroeconomic stability by strengthening fiscal management; and b) 
promote economic growth by increasing the productivity and competitiveness of the agricultural sector 
and strengthening the power sector’s financial viability and production capacity.  
 

 Preliminary Description 
 
6. The first pillar of the DPO series will focus on supporting macroeconomic stability by strengthening 
fiscal management. Not only is adequacy of the macroeconomic and fiscal framework a prerequisite for 
sustainable economic growth but budgetary and debt sustainability is necessary to the delivery of 
effective public services that maximize the impact of available revenues on beneficiaries, including the 
poorest segments of the populations. In addition, increasing fiscal space will help relax fiscal constraints 
to accommodate the financing of needed infrastructure projects.  
 
7. The second pillar will seek to promote economic growth by increasing the productivity of the 
agricultural sector and strengthening the power sector’s financial viability and production capacity. 
This series focuses on measures aimed at increasing the productivity of the agricultural sector by 
supporting a policy, regulatory, and institutional framework that strengthens agriculture value chains 
and enhances diversification, promotes higher quality standards for agricultural products and supports 
greater access to credit in the primary sector. Moreover, the measures supported by the operation 
strengthen the financial viability of the power sector that is necessary to attract private sector 
participation and, thus, increase electricity production capacity, including in renewables, and access to 
electricity in a sustainable way. 

 

 Poverty and Social Impacts and Environment Aspects 



 
Poverty and Social Impacts 
 
8. The FRGC series is expected to have a positive impact on poverty reduction. Measures to increase 
revenue and to strengthen public expenditure efficiency are expected to ensure ongoing fiscal space for 
the delivery of essential public services and to contribute to a macroeconomic environment conducive 
to economic growth and private sector employment creation.  
 
9. The supported measures aimed at increasing agricultural productivity and diversification are 
important in achieving the Government’s stated poverty reduction and equitable growth goals. 
Results from the Poverty Assessment indicate that while agricultural growth has contributed strongly to 
overall growth, the impact on poverty reduction has been limited. Diversifying production into more 
valuable crops, focusing more resources on export-oriented crops, and raising productivity should boost 
incomes among the large share of the population, especially the poor population, involved in 
agriculture. 
 
10. Initial results from the 2014 Poverty Assessment note the strong link between unemployment, 
underemployment and poverty. Gender-specific results and recommendations from the assessment 
have informed the policy dialogue with the Government. Gender disparities are especially pronounced 
in the credit market, where improving access to credit has had an important impact on women’s 
economic empowerment. Support for reforms designed to improve credit to agriculture sector and, 
enhance private-sector competitiveness and build a more diversified and resilient economy will have 
positive effects on employment creation and poverty reduction. 
 
11. Supported electricity sector reforms, should they meet their objective of encouraging increased 
access to electricity and more cost-effective provision of electricity, should have a direct and positive 
impact on the poor. Increased and more reliable access at affordable prices should also have a 
significant impact on firm creation, firm growth and resultant employment opportunities, particularly in 
the higher productivity formal sector. 
 
12. A Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) has been carried out to assess the potential impact 
of electricity pricing reforms in Benin. The PSIA concluded that improving the financial situation of the 
SBEE and thus reducing the gap between SBEE’s service unit cost and revenues per kWh are 
prerequisites for the expansion of SBEE operations throughout the country and greater access for poor 
households to electricity. The PSIA study also concluded that the current social policy of subsidizing the 
tariff for the poor is not effective and suggested some possible options to strengthen the policy 
including adopting a tariff policy based on usage and eliminating fixed costs for small customers. 
 
Environment Aspects  
 
13. The policies supported by the proposed DPF are not likely to have negative impacts on the 
country’s natural assets. All the actions supported throughout the first operation are policy-oriented; 
they do not support direct investment in environmentally impactful investments or involve policy 
actions with significant environmental consequences.  The measures supporting domestic resource 
mobilization and efficient management of public expenditure pose no risk to the environment. 
Measures designed to strengthen economic competitiveness are also largely environmentally neutral.  
 



14. Strengthening the financial viability of the power sector will support increased access to electricity 
and is expected to have a positive environmental impact. Households in Benin, particularly rural 
households, are highly dependent on biomass for their daily energy requirements. The reform program 
supported under the energy sector is likely to have positive environmental impacts and would help in 
the reduction of greenhouse gases occasioned by the predominance of fuel biomass (fuelwood, charcoal 
and plant wastes). The prior action of strengthening the financial viability of the power sector is likely to 
produce climate change mitigation co-benefit, since strengthening the financial viability of the sector is 
likely to promote the development of new energy efficient production capacities.  In the agricultural 
sector, measures intended to diversify agriculture away from a reliance on cotton could have a 
potentially positive environmental effect as agriculture becomes less mono-culture based and 
increasingly diversified. 
 
15. Over the last 20 years, the Government has made significant strides in mainstreaming 
environmental sustainability in projects. EIA is a legal requirement and it is widely applied to all 
developmental projects.  Environmental assessment is a necessary condition to obtain the approval to 
implement any development project. It has been set up in the Law N° 98-30 relating to the 
environmental framework and in the Decree N° 2001-235 relating to the environmental assessment 
procedures. The national environmental protection agency (ABE) has the capacity to implement, 
monitor, and report on mitigating measures and/or environmental and social management plans; and 
have been working in direct collaborations with the environmental and social specialists of the Bank 
funded projects.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 
1. Guinea is fortunate to possess considerable agricultural and mining resources. It possesses the world’s richest 

deposits of bauxite and iron as well as abundant agricultural land and water resources (“water tower” of West Africa). 
However, Guinea has yet to take advantage of this endowment to achieve sustainable economic growth and poverty 
reduction. Guinea remains one of Africa’s poorest countries and is classified among the Low Income and Food Deficit 
Countries by the World Bank. Per-capita income was approximately US$490 in 2016, less than one third of the regional 
average (US$1,505), and the majority of the population continues to live in extreme poverty. According to UNDP’s 
2015 Human Development Report1, Guinea ranks 182th out of 188 countries in terms of the Human Development 
Index (HDI). Guinea’s HDI of 0.411 is below the average for countries in the low human development group (0.505) 
and also for countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (0.518).  

 
2. Guinea past economic growth has been too slow and too inconsistent to reduce poverty. Since the mid-80s, 

economic growth increased due in part to the implementation of the Programme de Redressement Economique et 
Financier (Financial and Economic Redressing Program - PREF)2. Annual economic growth averaged 4.5 percent during 
the 1990-97 period, outpacing population growth (3.1 percent). Poverty declined and most social indicators 
improved3. However, these gains were short-lived. After 2000, the country experienced a series of internal political 
crises, and was negatively impacted by conflicts in neighboring countries (Liberia, Sierra Leone and Cote d’Ivoire)4. 
Economic growth slowed and poverty increased from 49 percent in 2002 to 53 percent in 2007 and more than 55 
percent in 2012. As is typical for many Sub-Saharan African countries, most of the poor are living in rural areas with a 
poverty rate of 65 percent against 32 percent in urban area (2012). Per recent detailed surveys of food security in 
Guinea5, close to a third of the country’s households (30.5 percent) are food insecure. 

 
3. Economic growth resumed after 2010 following the presidential elections that resulted in a return to constitutional 

order. Macroeconomic policies improved, structural reforms were carried out in key sectors and the country’s 
cooperation with external partners improved. Guinea reached the Highly-Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Completion 
Point in 2012 with the cancellation of two-thirds of its external debt. However, growth again faltered in 2013-2015 
with the Ebola outbreak which had a devastating impact on economic activity6. Economic growth dropped drastically 
to 2.4 percent in 2013, then 1.1 percent and 0.1 percent respectively in 2014 and 2015. GDP per capita declined 
accordingly to -0.9 percent, -2.1 and -2.2 over those years. The Ebola crisis took a heavy toll on the agriculture and the 
food sectors. Guinea like other African countries is highly vulnerable to internal and external shocks that can wipe out 
hard-earned development gains, and worsen already entrenched poverty. However, in 2016 strong growth was 
recorded (6.7 percent) driven by a strong harvest and the mining sector. 

 
4. Mining and agriculture are the dominant sectors in the country. The agriculture sector represents 20 percent of GDP. 

The mining sector currently consists of industrial-scale mining of bauxite, alumina and gold, and accounts for about

20 percent of GDP, 80 percent of foreign currency earnings and 20 to 25 percent of government revenue. However, 
the extractive industries do not create enough direct jobs opportunities. Secondly, strong investment and policies 
from the Government are a condition to diversify the economy. Thirdly, the sector increases governance risks and the 
potential for corruption. There is a strong risk that Guinea’s economy could become subject to the “resource curse” 
resulting from an overreliance on extractive industries. Such undesirable developments can be avoided by increasing 
investment in agricultural values chains to increase productivity and competitiveness, as well as investing in transport 
and marketing infrastructure and energy to facilitate economic diversification, inclusive private sector development 
and job creation. 
 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
5. The economy of Guinea is not sufficiently diversified, and structural transformation is incomplete. The agricultural 

sector is, along with the mining sector, the main engine of the economy7. Contrary to mining, which provides most of 

the country’s export revenues but creates little employment, agriculture still occupies approximately 80 percent of 

the active population. As a result, sustainable agricultural development is central to Guinea’s economic and social 

development agenda.  

6. Guinea is richly endowed with natural resources: 6.2 million ha of cultivable land, abundant rainfall and varied agro-

climatic conditions favorable to the production of a wide variety of cash and food crops. This considerable potential 

is largely underutilized. Only 25 percent of cultivable land is cultivated (including fallow land, with less than 10 percent 

cropped every year). Only 32,000 ha have been developed for irrigation out of a potential of 360,000 ha (less than 10 

percent).8 Agricultural productivity is very low, using extensive, rainfed agricultural and livestock farming systems. 

Farms are small and produce primarily for household consumption, with very little marketed surplus. The main food 

crops are cereals (rice, maize and fonio), root crops (cassava, yam, sweet potato and potato) and groundnut. Rice is 

by far the main crop representing more than two thirds of all cultivated land, and produced by 80 percent of 

agricultural households. It is also the main food import of the country. Women play particularly a key role in rice 

production, processing and marketing. The main cash crops are coffee, cotton, cashew, oil palm and rubber. Their 

importance in Agricultural GDP is negligible and exports are low despite the potential and market opportunity.  

7. Guinea's agriculture is key for poverty reduction, job creation and food security. The country has not been able to 

build on its natural advantages and on the traditional expertise of its farmers. Agriculture in Guinea is entangled in a 

vicious circle starting from lack of investment, and distorted incentives and interference in markets, leading to low 

productivity and competitiveness. Producers face high costs of factors and inputs, as well as high costs of 

transformation and commercialization. Unable to invest in quality, their products are sold at low prices, and face 

significant challenges reaching domestic and export markets.  

8. As a result, Guinean agriculture is missing the positive outcomes that would have been generated from oversea 

trade and market-oriented agribusiness, while other countries in the region have become world exporters of cash 

crops. Agriculture in Guinea represents 11% of exports and 17% of imports (PNIASA 2012). Agricultural exports are 

declining. In 2013, only five agricultural products were exported overseas: coffee, cocoa, rubber, cashew and mango. 

Cotton and banana, once Guinean major exports, have disappeared from overseas market. Guinean fruits and 

vegetables, as well as palm oil and rice are sold in neighboring countries, that are less demanding in terms of quality. 

 
7 20% for agriculture, 41% for the industrial sector (of which 15%for the mining sector) and 34%for the service sector. 
8 Of which 9 000 ha of bottom land (20% of potential), 15 000 ha of mangrove (13%), 8 000 ha of flood plains (6%).

To break the spell, a holistic approach to agriculture is needed, focused on markets, and enhancing upstream and 

downstream linkages. 

9. Agricultural growth has been driven by the increase in cultivated land estimated at 3% per year, consistent with the 

increase in rural population. Agriculture suffers from very low productivity constrained by a combination of limited 

use of improved technologies, failures in input, output and financial markets, and land tenure issues. Subsistence 

farmers, who account for 95 percent of the cultivated area, use very few agriculture inputs (e.g. improved seeds, 

fertilizer, pesticides, irrigation, and mechanization). Improved seeds are used on less than 8 percent of cultivated land 

with only 7 kg of fertilizer used per hectare, per year (among the lowest use in Africa). Yields are very low and have 

been stagnant for many years at less than 1t/ha for rainfed rice and 5 tons/ha for cassava. Many production areas are 

cut off from markets for part or most of the year, access to financial institutions is nearly non-existent and post-harvest 

losses are high (rice: 10 percent, maize: 15-20 percent, roots and tuber: 20-45 percent, fruits and vegetables: 30-60 

percent) due to poor cultural practices and post-harvest handling, the lack of storage and deficient transport services.  

Processing is negligible and mostly small-scale. The project would be instrumental in addressing these challenges.  

10. Animal husbandry is an important activity for the rural population. Guinea has a large herd of mostly local breeds, 

hardy and trypanotolerant9. Animal husbandry accounts for approximately 20 percent of Agricultural GDP and 4 

percent of total GDP. It provides revenues to approximately 30 percent of agricultural households. It also provides 

much needed animal protein to the population, and thus contributes to food security and nutritional status. Livestock 

systems are mostly traditional, extensive and with low productivity. The country has significant advantages for 

livestock production possessing large tracts of natural pasture land, water resources and ample availability of 

agricultural sub-products. Thus, despite very low public investment (less than 5 percent of public investment is in the 

agricultural sector), Guinea has registered reasonable long-term growth (3.8 percent per year). However, competition 

for land with agriculture is increasingly causing conflict, and constraining prevailing extensive, transhumant cattle 

raising systems. National production cannot keep up with demand, and the country has experienced a significant 

increase in livestock imports, mostly poultry and milk.  

11. Over the last few decades, increasing population pressures have been responsible for an accelerating degradation 

of the natural resource base, most visible in mangrove areas along the coast and in Guinée Forestière. These anthropic 

factors have been amplified by climate change. Data since 1960 show a continuous increase in temperature and 

decline in rainfall, together with an increased variability in the start of the agricultural season and more frequent dry 

spells and floods. Although difficult to predict with any precision, it is anticipated that these trends will continue in 

the future, with important negative impacts on ecosystems and agricultural production with a decrease in crop yields 

estimated at 10 to 25 percent by 205010. To mitigate these adverse developments, Guinea has prepared its Programme 

d’Action National pour l’Adaptation aux Changements Climatiques (National Action Program for Climate Change 

Adaptation - PANA, 2007) which identifies preventive and adaptation measures such as development of irrigation, 

development and dissemination of drought-resistant varieties, protection of forests and watersheds, improved soil 

and water conservation practices, environmental education, etc.  

12. Regarding institutional context, the Government of Guinea has long recognized the critical role of agriculture for 

economic growth and poverty reduction. It has prepared and implemented a series of strategies and plans. The most 

recent are: (i) the Plan National d’Investissement Agricole et de Sécurité Alimentaire (National Agricultural and Food 

 
9 Estimated in 2012 at 5.5 million cattle, 4.0 million small ruminants, 105.000 pigs and 24 million poultry. 
10 Various models forecast a decline in rainfall of 100-to-400 mm and an increase in temperature of 1.5 to 3.0 degrees by 2050.

Security Investment Plan - PNIASA, 2013-2017), (ii) the Programme Accéléré de Sécurité Alimentaire et Nutritionnelle 

et de Développement Agricole Durable (Accelerated Program of Food and Nutritional Security, and Sustainable 

Agricultural Development - PASANDAD, 2016-2020), and (iii) the Plan National de Développment Economique et Social 

(National Economic and Social Development Plan – PNDES, 2016-2020). PASANDAD is a strategy, an orientation 

framework and a program fully integrated in the PNDES and aiming at improving food and nutrition security, 

accelerating agricultural production (crop, animal, fish and forestry), improving commercialization, storage and 

processing, and reducing foods imports. PNDES is targeting a primary sector growth rate of 8.1 percent by 2020 

horizon by setting up agro-poles across the districts focusing on the development of values chains with high value-

added, a core component of PASANDAD. Also, PASANDAD is seeking to spur implementation of PNIASA which will be 

completed on December 31, 2017.  

13. A detailed analysis of PNIASA achievements has been initiated in the context of preparation of the successor 

program (PNIASA 2) for the 2018-22 period. This assessment is on-going and preliminary results from 2015 showed 

clearly that, although some positive results were achieved, most of PNIASA’s strategic objectives will not be met: 

▪ Actual growth in the sector has been lower than the PNIASA annual 6 percent growth target with 5.1 percent in 

2013, 2.7 in 2014 and 4.1 in 2015. Like most of Sub-Saharan African countries, Guinea did not meet the ECOWAS 

and CAADP 6 percent agricultural growth goal;  

▪ About rice production, the objectives - a 300 percent increase in production through increased use of irrigation, 

a doubling of yields (from 1.2 to 2.45 t/ha) and the elimination of rice imports - will not be achieved. Rice 

production continued to increase at about 3% per year, largely through the expansion of cultivated areas, and rice 

imports have increased;  

▪ Regarding food crop diversification, while satisfactory results have been achieved with maize and fonio 

production which has exceeded PNIASA’s objectives, the production of cassava has not; 

▪ With respect to cash crop production and exports, there has been no significant increase, as the current business 

environment related to access to markets, inputs and services is still not conducive to large private investments 

in agricultural sector;    

▪ Concerning livestock production, despite very little public support with less than 2 percent of the agricultural 

budget, the sector continued to show reasonable annual growth of about 4 percent on the strength of its 

traditional extensive systems and also of the development of peri-urban poultry production;  

▪ Regarding development of infrastructure, only 1,400 km of rural roads have been rehabilitated through 2015, 

against an objective of 3,000 km (47 percent), and only 10,000 ha brought under irrigation to date against the end 

of the Plan target of 110,000 ha. 

 

14. The disappointing results registered so far are due in part to the impact of the Ebola epidemic, as well as a large 

shortfall in the PNIASA financing plan. The financing plan suffered from two clear weaknesses: (i) an extreme 

dependency on external sources (approximately 90 percent of financing); and (ii) the low level of financial resources 

mobilized at the start (less than 25 percent). In fact, annual budget allocations for the sector averaged 5 percent, much 

lower than anticipated by PNIASA’s financing plan and the Maputo objective of 10% public spending on agriculture. 

As lessons learnt from PNIASA underperformance, it is worthy to have ambitious development objective, but 

mobilization of required resources and its efficient distribution and use across the activities driving growth are critical 

to meet it. Also, whatever the agricultural potential and opportunities offered by the country, private sector could be 

attracted if and only the business environment is favorable.

15. Like the new PNDES approved in June 2017 by the Parliament, PNIASA 2 will be consistent with the African Union’s 

Agenda 2063 for the structural transformation of Africa, the Paris Agreement (COP 21) on climate change and the 

UN’s Universal Program for Sustainable Development.  PNIASA 2 will also be based on the main principles of the 

Malabo Declaration (2014) which reaffirms that agriculture is at the heart of Africa’s economic and social development 

while enlarging governments’ commitments to areas, such as rural infrastructure, natural resource management and 

nutrition which, are critical for agricultural growth and poverty reduction.  

16. Realigning its interventions to the PASANDAD, World bank will support the development of value chains and the 

emergence of commercial agriculture, complementing ongoing operations with (i) the proposed IDA operation 

focusing on selected staple crops for domestic and regional market, (ii) an IBRD-enclave operation focusing on 

potentially exportable crops for international market, (iii) another IDA operation on rural mobility and connectivity, 

and (iv) a Development Policy Operation (DPO) supporting structural reform in the governance of the sector and 

particularly the agricultural subsidy program for more targeting, transparency and efficiency. In addition, a review of 

the agricultural sector and the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) are being completed. The proposed project will 

draw heavily on findings from these analytical works.  

17. Progress is being made by the Agriculture Sector Support Project (PASA-G) on strengthening institutional capacity 

and by the West Africa Agricultural Productivity Program (WAAPP) on reinforcing research, regional transfer of 

innovations and improved technologies to farmers, and rebuilding seeds production systems. Building on these 

achievements, to pave way for structural agricultural transformation for inclusive economic growth and poverty 

reduction, Guinea needs to: (i) increase agricultural productivity through a climate-smart intensification and 

sustainable mechanization of the production systems to create jobs, leveraging on WAAPP; (ii) develop and integrate 

agricultural values chains and food systems to increase value addition; (iii) improve competitiveness and develop 

agricultural markets seizing upon growing domestic, regional and international food demand; (iv) reinforce basic 

production infrastructure and logistics to enable irrigation, connection, connectivity or mobility, storage and agro-

processing for a better agri-business environment more attractive to the private sector. Also, a special attention 

should be paid to finding ways to attract youth to modern agribusiness including access to water and land-efficient 

technologies, modern labor-saving irrigation and agro-processing technologies, and advisory and financial services. 

The project will be instrumental in contributing to this development agenda. 

Relationship to CPF 
 
18. The last closing Guinea Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, 2014-2017) focused on: (i) improving governance and 

service delivery, (ii) stimulating growth and economic diversification, and (iii) strengthening human capital. A 

Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) is being completed. The SCD identified two hypotheses and the five most critical 

binding constraints and opportunities facing Guinea in achieving the World Bank Group’s twin goals of ending extreme 

poverty and boosting shared prosperity. The first hypothesis arguing that poor political and economic governance is 

at the center of Guinea’s development difficulties, leading to natural resources mismanagement, institutional 

fragmentation, and ineffective public investment. The second hypothesis is that low levels of structural transformation 

are affected by unproductive agriculture and poorly planned urbanization. Guinea’s position regarding agriculture is 

interesting since Guinea is performing significantly below its potential despite abundant rainfall and agricultural land. 

For a variety of historical reasons, agriculture was not given prominence in Guinea, and the potential for agricultural 

development remains largely underexploited. The three critical binding constraints related to agriculture are the 

following. First, although resilient, Guinea’s agriculture is underperforming, partly due to farmers’ limited access to

Jul 23, 2017 Page 8 of 16  

     

quality inputs (fertilizer, seeds, and equipment). Second, Guinea’s poor infrastructure (road, ports and logistics 

services, power and telecommunications) is a major obstacle to private sector development. Finally, access to finance 

is difficult for smallholders and entrepreneurs and low levels of private investment and undercapitalization are 

manifest. Taken together, the improvement in these constraints will be able to help Guinea move forward. The project 

will be instrumental in addressing most of these constraints in the agricultural sector by improving productivity, value 

chain diversification and integration, market development and competitiveness, infrastructures and logistics to enable 

agribusiness development and create job. A multisector approach will be used bringing Agriculture, Trade and 

Competitiveness, and Transport Global Practices to team up. The project will support anticipatively the 

implementation of the upcoming CPS which will be guided by findings from the SCD. The project is also consistent 

with the Africa Regional Strategy. 

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  
 
19. The Project development objective is to increase productivity, processing and market transactions between producers 

and other actors participating in targeted agricultural values chains in the project areas. 

Key Results (From PCN) 
 
20. The proposed PDO level performance indicators are: i) Number of Farmers reached with agricultural assets or services 

of which female (at least 40%) and youth (at least 10%); ii) Increase in productivity (ton/ha) of targeted agricultural 

commodities by direct beneficiaries; (iii) Volume of targeted agricultural commodities processed with the new 

facilities (t); and (iv) Increase in volume of market sales of targeted agricultural commodities by Project-supported 

beneficiaries (%). A detailed result monitoring framework and indicators would be developed during project 

preparation.  

21. It is expected that the project would result in increased productivity and production coupled with reduced post-

harvest losses, more integrated agricultural systems, improved product range and quality, more efficient processing 

with a better access to facilities, and improved marketing and mobility, thereby generating additional incomes for 

producers and other operators in the targeted value chains. The preliminary selected value chains are rice, maize, 

horticulture (vegetables and fruits), livestock (poultry in particular) and aquaculture (fresh, dry and smoked fish) for 

which market opportunities exist and productivity gains are achievable through better water control and adoption of 

proven technologies leveraging on WAAPP. These commodities present potentially profitable business opportunities 

that can attract youth and the private sector and contribute directly to rural poverty reduction as production is 

dominated by poor smallholders. The project will be gender-sensitive targeting both men and women as key players 

of the value chains. It is expected also that the project would develop an innovative business model for youth insertion 

in agribusiness replicable throughout the region. 

22. The project would contribute to integrated agricultural development to improve food security, income and youth 

employment. This would be achieved by improving productive infrastructure, integrating values chains, and 

developing agribusinesses and markets. An integrated approach would be used vertically along the targeted values 

chains and horizontally across the selected agricultural subsectors including crops, livestock and aquaculture.  

 

D. Concept Description

Guinea Integrated Agricultural Development Project (GIADP) (P164326)

23. The design of the proposed project would build upon the achievements and lessons learned from the 

implementation of on-going or closed projects and programs in Guinea and elsewhere in the region. Close 

coordination and synergy would be sought with ongoing or upcoming projects and programs, and approaches would 

be harmonized to leverage support in critical areas, optimize development outcomes and avoid duplication. In 

particular, partnerships would be sought with (i) the project financed by Agence Française de Développement (French 

Development Agency - AFD) and the European Union (EU) for developing rice-cum-fish production; (ii) the forthcoming 

AFD-financed rural road project; (iii) the Third Village Community Project (PACV) financed by IDA and AFD; (iv) the 

West African Agricultural Productivity Program (WAAPP) financed by IDA; (v) the Agriculture Sector Support Project 

(PASA-G); (vi) the Agricultural Services Support Project financed by USAID under its « Feed the Future » Program; (vii) 

the Growth Pole Project under preparation for funding by the Abu Dhabi Development Fund; (viii) the upcoming rural 

mobility and connectivity project financed by IDA; and (ix) the future IBRD-enclave project.  

24. The design of the project considers the growing need for Guinea to transformits agriculture sector by increasing 

substantially productivity and resilience against climate change, integrating values chains, developing markets, 

improving competitiveness, and reinforcing infrastructure to foster economic growth, improve food security and 

nutrition, and contribute to end extreme poverty. With the increasing concern for youth employment, it is more than 

ever critical to enable agriculture to offer attractive business opportunities for youth. The project will focus support 

on (i) a selected number of value chains that are both important in terms of food and nutrition security, and have 

significant development potential to respond to market opportunities; (ii) a selected geographical area to resolve the 

binding constraints on productivity, quality, value-addition and market linkages. 

25. The proposed project would consist of four interconnected components structured as follows: 

Component 1:  Supporting productive infrastructure and logistics systems 
 

26.  This component would support critical public and private infrastructure and logistics systems required to better 
valorize land and water resources to improve productivity and competitiveness of agricultural value chains. It would 
consist of three sub-components: 
 

27. Subcomponent 1.1: Water control and management. This subcomponent would consist of improving water 

management and small scale irrigation systems within existing irrigation schemes to be rehabilitated or developed. 

Land planning and water management are critical in strengthening resilience and increasing productivity and 

competitiveness. This would enable the expansion of cropped areas, the mechanization of production systems and 

production two to three times a year and consequently, yield increases. Increasing the cropping intensity is yet an 

opportunity to be exploited for Guinea agricultural development. Less than 10% of the irrigable land estimated at 

360,000 ha is developed. Also, the project would contribute to restore and develop under-used low-land (9,000 ha 

out of a potential of 180,000 ha) and flood plains (8,000 ha out of a potential of 200,000 ha). A master planning study 

on irrigation is underway and will inform the interventions areas and perimeters to be targeted. By targeting some 

works with no or limited environmental impact such as catchment weirs and drainage networks, supporting small-

scale irrigation systems and promoting the adoption of efficient water and land management technologies, the project 

would contribute significantly to developing irrigated agriculture in line with PANSANDAD priorities. It would support 

the use of improved labor-saving irrigation systems to modernize horticultural production, alleviate women’s 

irrigation burden and attract youth to this business. It would finance water user associations and develop management 

procedures and guidelines to ensure the sustainability of irrigation infrastructures. The project would aim at a

Jul 23, 2017 Page 10 of 16  

     

substantial increase in yield in the irrigated perimeters, leveraging on WAAPP for producer access to improved 

certified seeds and technologies.  

28. Subcomponent 1.2: Storage, conditioning and logistics systems. This subcomponent would address the lack of 

agricultural machinery, storage, conditioning and logistics assets that prevent value chain development. It would seek 

to improve postharvest management facilities to improve quality, lower costs and enhance competitiveness, 

particularly for domestically produced rice and horticultural crops. In particular, the project would finance: (i) storage 

facilities for adequate conservation of the harvest; (ii) agro-processing equipment to reduce post-harvest losses and 

allow processing and packaging of agricultural produces for value addition; (iii) production and processing facilities for 

livestock (poultry and milk) and fish produces (smoked and dry); (iv) agricultural market infrastructure; and (v) 

processing platforms in targeted large production zones and in partnership with the upcoming IBRD-Enclave 

operation. Investment selection would be based on selection criteria including economic analyses. Investments would 

require a business plan, a mechanism for sustainable operation, and be tied to market demand.  Private sector 

involvement in those investments could be structured either through direct investment, joint ventures or PPP projects.  

29. Finally, the project would work closely with the Rural Mobility and Connectivity project under preparation to unlock 

production areas, connect farmers to markets, and attract private sector investment in agricultural values chains.  The 

required roads to be built in the targeted areas would be jointly identified. 

Component 2: Increasing agricultural productivity 
 

30. Subcomponent 2.1: Access to quality inputs and machinery. The project would leverage on WAAPP to enable the 

wide diffusion of improved technologies including certified seeds of improved varieties, fertilizers, best and 

environmentally-friendly practices for the intensification of production systems. The project’s emphasis would be on 

supporting appropriate and sustainable agricultural mechanization through the transfer of improved motorized 

machinery developed throughout the region leveraging on WAAPP, the development of machinery services and 

leasing systems. The project would provide financial and technical assistance for entrepreneurs developing 

agricultural machinery and using appropriate technology to develop prototypes and systems.  It would engage these 

entrepreneurs via business plan competitions and matchmaking with regional and international incubators for 

innovation and appropriate technology.  

31. Subcomponent 2.2: Institutional strengthening. Leveraging on WAAPP, the project would provide support to the 

national extension service, the Agence National de la Promotion Rurale et du Conseil Agricole (National Agency for 

Rural Promotion and Agricultural Council - ANPROCA), strengthening its institutional capacity through financial and 

logistic support, and capacity building. Efforts would be put on connecting and articulating agricultural extension 

services to research to enable dissemination of improved technologies and agricultural advisory services. 

Component 3: Developing and integrating agricultural values chains  
 

32. Subcomponent 3.1: Capacity building and value chain coordination. Under this sub-component, the project would 

strengthen the technical and management skills of producers’ groups including youth and women’s groups, 

cooperatives, professional associations and other stakeholders benefiting from the project. With support from agro-

processing research institutes, more sophisticated agribusiness firms, NGOs and entrepreneurship incubators, training 

would focus on improving and upgrading agro-processing technologies. Training may concern packaging and 

compliance with food safety standards for quality assurance while promoting artisanal agro-processing. Training in

accounting, operations, using technology for business, financial management and marketing may be provided. The 

project would develop, adapt and/or deliver training on a range of business and technical subjects. Innovative personal 

initiative training that encourages entrepreneurial thinking and problem solving may also be delivered. Building on 

WAAPP experiences, innovation platforms may be created or reinforced for some value chains to develop partnerships 

among stakeholders. These efforts would build on, and may form partnerships with past and present training and 

capacity building efforts of World Bank Group partners, and other donors and organizations. IFC’s Agribusiness team 

may help replicate its Agribusiness Leadership Program which aims to professionalize producers/cooperatives by 

improving their technical and managerial capacity, and supporting them to access finance. The project may collaborate 

with IFAD’s program (Plan National d’Appui aux Acteurs des Filières Agricoles) whose objective is also to provide 

capacity building to farmer’s organization in the same value chains targeted by this project. FAO and AFD have similar 

programs in different value chains. Finally, for coordination of all initiatives on farmer’s professionalization, the project 

may work within the local Market Ecosystem Alliance (AMEA) platform, under creation by the IFC’s Agribusiness 

advisory team, which aims to standardize tools and mechanisms for farmers’ professionalization. For SMEs, more 

involved at the middle of value-chains (processing, packaging, storage, transportation), the recently-created SME 

Business center under Guinea MSME Project has the potential to become a robust platform to provide technical and 

management capacity to SME. The project would take stock of the SME Business Center’s development with an aim 

to partnering with it to deliver technical assistance and services.  

33.  Subcomponent 3.2: Access to finance for agribusiness development. This subcomponent would promote youth 

entrepreneurship and private sector investment in agribusiness through a matching grant mechanism to be defined 

in consultation with stakeholders. The project would support development of Micro, Small and Medium Agribusiness 

Enterprises (MSMAEs) to increase domestic production and processing of high-quality rice, horticultural produces 

(mango, pineapple, banana, potatoes etc.), and livestock, particularly for poultry and dairy products, and fish 

(aquaculture, dry and smoked fish etc.). The percentage of cost sharing required by beneficiaries would be determined 

during the project design phase. The matching grants may be disbursed through one or more windows each targeting 

specific types of beneficiaries, kinds of financial support or objectives. Training and capacity building activities would 

be made available to complement financing. The project would develop relationships with financial institutions to 

encourage co-financing of beneficiaries’ activities. Under this subcomponent, support would be given to the creation 

of integrated aquaculture-poultry-rice firms leveraging experience developed in Nigeria under the West and Central 

Africa Council for Agricultural Research and Development (CORAF/WECARD) Multi-Donor Trust Fund.  In addition, this 

subcomponent would support the development of agricultural machinery services led by youth groups or producers’ 

organizations.   

34. Subcomponent 3.3: Formation of productive alliances for cash crops. The productive alliance is an economic 

agreement between a group of organized producers and a buyer (intermediary, wholesaler, agro-processor or 

processor, international mining company) in which all parties assume risks, provide resources, and share the benefits, 

such that the agreement can continue over the medium and long term. The subcomponent’s main output would be 

the implementation of subprojects with clearly defined and sustainable goals, and cost sharing accompanied by 

technical assistance and business development services. It would help build productive alliances between rural 

producers and their buyers (intermediaries, wholesalers, processors or exporters) for cash crops value chains, and 

finance part of joint business plans. By formalizing relationships among value chain actors, the project would facilitate 

access to finance and expand opportunities for investment in cash crop value chains ultimately increasing the revenues 

of producers and industrial firms, improving the quality of Guinean products, and increasing exports and value added.

35. This subcomponent would leverage past and ongoing efforts in Guinea to study and develop productive alliances. The 

World Bank and the IFC have undertaken studies to identify potential sectors and potential value chain participants 

for productive alliances. This effort would be linked to IFC’s network of more sophisticated agribusinesses that may 

be interested in buying from producers’ associations associated with the project. This subcomponent would link with 

IFC and World Bank work with financial institutions to de-risk, identify opportunities and increasingly lending to 

agribusinesses. Furthermore, the project would leverage ongoing IFC initiatives supporting the development of the 

local content in the mining sector specifically to overcome obstacles to selling food to the mines.  

36. Subcomponent 3.4: Provision of the market information system: This subcomponent would finance collaboration 

with producers’ and marketing associations to provide agribusinesses with the information they need to plan their 

operations and transact with their customers. The project would build upon pre-existing IT solutions in place where 

possible, or create new systems that are responsive to the needs of agribusinesses, their suppliers and their 

customers, and managed by market-oriented organizations. The goal would be to link producers to customers in 

markets in urban areas in Guinea and in neighboring countries, build business relationships between buyers and 

sellers, and facilitate transactions. A survey of market information systems initiatives and use, and an action plan 

would be prepared during project preparation.  

37. Subcomponent 3.5: Support to investment promotion in agricultural value chains. Through a results-based 

Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Investment Promotion Agency (APIP), this subcomponent would 

finance experts, targeted Technical Assistance (TA), consulting services, trainings, and IT development and equipment 

to facilitate private investments in agribusiness and cash crop value chains. Support for APIP under the Guinea MSME 

Development Project has increased the Agency’s capabilities, but agribusiness investing is and requires special 

attention. The new project would continue to support APIP so that it can attract and retain agribusiness investors, 

both foreign and domestic. This subcomponent would also fund efforts to improve public-private dialogue to inform 

policy decisions that take stock of the needs of agribusiness investors. The project would use the World Bank-

developed framework, “Enabling the Business of Agriculture,” to identify business environment constraints to 

investment support activities to overcome them.  

 

Component 4: Project implementation and coordination 
 

38. This component aims to ensure that the project is efficiently managed, monitored, and that performance and impacts 

are carefully tracked. It would: (i) finance the incremental expenses incurred in implementing the project through the 

project implementation unit (PIU) and the participating field implementing agencies and various service providers; (ii) 

provide technical assistance through consultancies, audits, and training to enhance implementation capacity of the 

PIU; (iii) finance communication and outreach activities; (iv) finance monitoring and evaluation of project outcomes 

and impacts; (v) support institutional strengthening to ensure sustainability of the project; and (vi) provision funds to 

address emergency demands arising from natural disasters or other shocks.  

39. Finally, the project may finance the agricultural census in partnership with others donors.  
 

  

  SAFEGUARDS

A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 
Activities with a physical footprint includes water control and management, building or rehabilitating storage facilities 

and establishment or development of Micro, Small and Medium Agribusiness Enterprises (MSMAEs) to increase domestic 
production and processing capacities for staple crops including high-quality rice, horticultural produces (mango, 
pineapple, banana, potatoes etc.), livestock and particularly poultry and dairy produces, and fish produces (aquaculture, 
dry and smoked fish etc.). The physical locations and specific details of the proposed project interventions are not as yet 
known. 
 

 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
This preliminary Borrower’s institutional Capacity for Safeguard policies will be completed during the project preparation 

to complete the information that are not yet available. The preliminary assessment considers:  
(i)-Policy framework:  
Article 19 (3) of the constitution states that: "the People has the right to the preservation of his heritage, culture and of 

its environment ".  Therefore, the environmental policy framework is rooted in the provisions of the Constitution. The 
Environment code was published on May 28, 1987. In November 8, 1989 the government published a Decree Regulating 
Impact Studies. 
(ii)-Operationalization of policy framework:  
The national Environmental and Social Assessment and ESIA review process is under the responsibility of the Ministry of 

the Environment through the Guinean Bureau of Studies and Environmental Assessment (BGEEE). It is part of its functions 
to monitoring and preserving the quality of the environment and advising the Government on the environmental issues. 
Since March 2013, the Government adopted a General Environmental Assessment Guide that provides project 

developers with technical support to carry out environmental and social impact studies necessary for a better analysis of 
their projects.  
(iii)-Resourcing 
In general, the ministry of environment and other state institutions in charge to handle environmental and social issues 

including BGEEE are poorly staffed.  
At the institutional level, environmental and social units are set up in the main sectors (agriculture, livestock and 

fisheries). At the decentralized level, the environmental monitoring committees (CPSE) exist.  
At the concept stage of the project, the structure that will host the PIU is not yet found.  Once defined, an in-depth 

assessment will be conducted and an action plan defined. The Unit will hire full time Environmental and Social 
Development Specialists during project preparation and implementation period.  
(iv)-Practice/outcomes/track record 
BGEEE statistics are not published yet annually  confirming that a robust archiving system will be necessary.  Despite the 

past experience with the WB safeguards policies implementation (WAAPP, PASAG, PRAO…) the borrower capacity to 
ensure the safeguards implementation in the in the satisfactory manner remains low and more capacity building will be 
needed including the logistic support to BGEEE.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The proposed project is categorized as B under this OP 
because its potential social and environmental risks 
are expected to moderate and mostly site specific, 
with no significant or long-term negative impacts. The 
potential environmental impacts are related to 
components 1, 2 and 3 activities ( Water control and 
management, building or rehabilitating storage 
facilities and establishment or development of Micro, 
Small and Medium Agribusiness Enterprises (MSMAEs) 
to increase domestic production and processing 
capacities for high-quality rice, horticultural produces 
(mango, pineapple, banana, potatoes etc.), livestock 
and particularly poultry and dairy produces, and fish 
produces (aquaculture, dry fish etc.).   An ESMF will be 
prepared and disclosed prior appraisal to guide the 
way that potential negative environmental and social 
impacts of future sub-projects (following the positive 
list) will be identified and mitigated during the project 
implementation. In the meantime, specific sites will be 
identified during the project preparation and 
ESIAs/EMPs prepared for the first year of the project 
implementation. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 TBD  

Forests OP/BP 4.36 TBD 

The decision to trigger or not this policy will be taken 
prior appraisal. Nevertheless, the project activities will 
avoid any negative impacts on the health and quality 
of forests. The project will avoid financing any activity 
that should have any negative impact in the natural 
forests. The ESMF will include sections relevant on 
how. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The project activities will likely increase the use of 
chemical pesticides which could have negative 
environmental and health impacts. A pest 
management plan will be prepared to mitigate this 
risk. Moreover, the Project will support the diffusion 
of best agricultural practices environmentally-friendly 
including  integrated pest management practices 
combining chemical and biological control of pest and 
disease to support sustainable agriculture.

Jul 23, 2017 Page 15 of 16  

     

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

The proposed operation will involve excavations and 
movement of earth for the building facilities. During 
the development of the ESMF physical cultural 
resources will be taken into consideration and 
baselines defined.  The ESMF will include clear 
procedures that will be required for identification, 
protection of cultural property from theft, and 
treatment of discovered artifacts, and will be included 
in standard bidding documents. The ESMF will also 
provide procedures for handling with “chance finds” 
during implementation project activities. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No  

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

Involuntary Resettlement is triggered in the vent that 
sub-projects should involve involuntary resettlement 
as the Project will finance construction/rehabilitation 
of processing facilities; and infrastructures that may 
imply land acquisition in the covered areas. A RPF will 
be prepared that will guide the management of such 
situations should they arise during project 
implementation. RAPs will be prepared as and when 
necessary. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No The project is not anticipating financing any dam. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
The project does not anticipate any wide activity that 
could impact international waterways. only small 
irrigation scheme will be rehabilitated or developed. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
The project does not anticipate any disputes in the 
targeted area. 

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Feb 15, 2018 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS

Other Decision (as needed) 
 
 
B. Introduction and Context 

 

Country Context 

1. Chad is a vast and landlocked country in Central Africa characterized by land degradation and 
erratic climatic conditions. It has a total land area of 1,284,000 km2 that encompasses three agro-
ecological zones: Saharan, Sahelian, and Sudanian. Out of a total population of over 14 million people, 47 
percent live below the poverty line. Chad ranked 186 out of 188 on the 2016 Human Development Index 
(HDI, 2016), making it one of the poorest and most deprived countries in the world. Chad remains largely 
rural, with over three-quarters of its population living in rural areas where they depend on subsistence 
farming for both household food and income security. The country is also beset with high unemployment, 
particularly among the youth. 

2. The economy continues to underperform, due to impacts from two main exogenous shocks: 
low oil prices and elevated regional insecurity. The oil and agricultural sectors were Chad's main growth 
drivers until the fall of the world oil price in 2014. Since then, Chad has experienced a sharp economic 
slow-down, with a fall in government revenue, resulting in a significant reduction in public expenses 
negatively impacting GDP growth (from 6.3% in 2014 to 0.2% in 2017)1,  leading the economy into deeper 
recession.  This difficult economic situation has been exacerbated by the prevailing serious threat to 
security in the region (including civil conflict and low-level insurgencies in the neighboring countries of 
Sudan, Nigeria, CAR and Libya), which has caused economic disruption in Chad and forced the Government 
to reprioritize its spending to defense, hosting of refugees and internally displaced persons. It also had an 
impact on cross-border trade, leading to the collapse of internal and external trade, especially for 
livestock, and a major disruption of the trade routes of imported products, especially in the Sahel.  

3. The short and medium-term outlooks remain challenging, with projected GDP growth for 2019 
of 3.15 percent. The situation has led the Government of Chad to prioritize diversification of the economy, 
focusing more on the non-oil sectors. The most important of these is the agricultural sector, which 
employs 80% of the Chadian workforce and accounts for 52% of GDP. It is also the second largest source 
of export income, after oil. In its 2016 – 2020 national development plan, the Government has, among 
other actions, prioritized the industrialization of agriculture, with the aim of boosting exports in order to 
diversify the economy to reduce its dependence on oil exports and increase tax revenue. 

4. The country is also experiencing rapid population growth (6.3% annually from 2010 to 20152), 
with a large youth cohort – more than 65% of the population is under the age of 25. The majority of the 
population remains rural, deriving their incomes from subsistence farming and herding activities, relying 
on traditional extensive production techniques, with limited access to markets and services (Systematic 
Country Diagnosis - SCD, 2015). Women engaged in agriculture and/or living in rural areas face 
considerable barriers: Chad ranks 140 out of 144 on the Global Gender Gap Index. Adult female literacy 
rate is 13.9% per UNESCO, about half that of men, and women are often confined to producing

subsistence crops and traditional farming, with little access to advisory services and inputs (mainly 
captured by men). As a result, they are financially more vulnerable.  

5. Food insecurity is a big concern that is likely to be exacerbated by climate change. It is estimated 
that one out of 10 Chadians, or 1.4 million people, are chronically food-insecure, meaning they are unable 
to meet their basic food requirements even during “good” years of crop harvest. The situation worsens 
during “bad” years – characterized by limited availability of and constrained access to food – where 
millions more can easily and quickly fall into transitory food insecurity. Difficulties in access to food are 
partly attributed to the poor performance of the important crops and livestock sub-sectors, which are 
characterized by sluggish productivity growth due to multiple factors. Such factors include lack of and 
limited access to promising technologies, underinvestment in new technologies, as well as climate-related 
constraints. Crop and livestock production are highly dependent on rainfall, making these sub-sectors 
extremely vulnerable to climate shocks (in particular the scarcity and poor distribution of rainfall over 
time and space). This situation is aggravated by the country’s vulnerability to climatic risks, both short-
term risks associated with its inherent climatic variability and long-terms risks associated with climate 
change. The National Action Program of Adaptation (NAPA, 2010) reported that the main short-term 
climate risks are associated with droughts, floods, poor spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall, 
extreme heat, and strong winds. 

 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 

6. Chad has enormous unrealized agricultural potential. The country has a total agricultural area of 
more than 49 million hectares, of which only 6 percent is currently cultivated. Similarly, the available 
water resources remain largely untapped, with only 9 percent of this potential being used. Less than 1 
percent of the agricultural land is under irrigation in Chad. The main Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZ) in Chad, 
from North to South, are the Saharian (up to 200 mm average annual rainfall), the Sahelian (200-700 mm) 
and the Sudanian (over 750 mm) AEZ. These distinct AEZs provide a unique opportunity to diversify 
agricultural production and to develop dynamic and complementary crop and livestock value chains. 
While other projects are already targeting livestock systems in the Sahelian AEZ, the proposed project will 
focus on the higher potential Sudanian AEZ where smallholder farmers are engaged mainly in traditional 
rainfed cereal-based (sorghum, millet and berbéré and associated pulses) farming systems, but including 
also some small livestock production. This zone is also a transit zone for livestock herds as they move 
southwards from the Sahelian AEZ during the dry season, causing some farmer-livestock herder conflicts. 

7. Despite its vast potential, the agriculture sector continues to underperform. Yields of key cereals 
are far below the averages for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and yield gains have not kept pace with the yield 
gains achieved in other countries. For example, sorghum yields average stand between 720 and 785 
kg/ha3 respectively for Sahelian and Sudanian zones of Chad, against an average of 980 kg/ha in the 
ECOWAS4 region.  

8. Average rainfall ranges between 800 to 1250 mm in the Sudanian Agro-Ecological Zone (AEZ), but 
the distribution increases in variability, in both inter-annual quantities and geographic distribution, when 
moving from the south towards the north. The main crops are cereals (sorghum, berbéré, maize and rice),

mostly intercropped with legumes, and roots and tubers, mainly grown for household consumption. 
Farmers also cultivate cotton for cash. Unfortunately, production of cotton is in sharp decline due to weak 
value chain organization. The Sudanian AEZ area is also classified as a cattle husbandry (and 
transhumance) area. Finally, collection of wild fruits and plants remains common, especially collection of 
shea nuts. 

9. The 2017 Agriculture Sector Review Report (ASRR) described how Chadian agriculture is going 
through a deep crisis. The sector is struggling to modernize and remains largely dependent on weather 
conditions. However, the report emphasized the potential for development of family farming in terms of 
productivity, profitability and resilience to shocks and its potential to meet the national and external food 
demand and improve the welfare of the rural populations.  

10. Several related factors explain the low productivity of Chadian agriculture: 

▪ Weak research and extension services as well as low overall institutional capacity constrain 
innovation and slow the rate of technical change. The agriculture research and development 
(AR&D) system is weak, with limited human and infrastructure resources and lack of continued 
programmatic support. In addition, the limited reach of public and private agricultural extension 
and advisory services significantly affects the dissemination and adoption of promising 
technologies.  

▪ The use of low yielding agricultural technologies and poor and unsustainable traditional 
agricultural practices are the main characteristics of Chadian subsistence farming. Farmers lack 
access to improved agricultural technologies, as well as to the know-how needed to improve 
productivity. For example, less than 5% of farmers are currently using improved seeds (Agriculture 
Sector Review, May 2017).  

▪ The growing population is increasing pressure on existing fertile production resources and hence 
rendering the practice of extensive subsistence agriculture and traditional livestock management 
systems more challenging over time. Increased competition for the shrinking natural capital often 
results in tensions between diverse user communities with at times conflicting interests. As a 
result, the increasing pressure on natural resources, particularly in marginal areas and their fragile 
eco-systems, are leading to lower soil fertility levels, soil erosion and degradation. 

▪ Climate shocks are exacting an increasing toll on Chadian agriculture. The Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) categorizes Chad as one of the countries highly vulnerable to the 
impacts of climate change. Vulnerability in Chad is characterized by increasing scarcity of available 
natural resources, fragile and substantially degraded soils, high level of food security and poverty, 
and lack of infrastructure, which hinder the capacity of local population to adapt to severe 
weather conditions. Indeed, the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) of the 
Republic of Chad (September 2015) indicates that over the past decades, the Saharan and 
Sahelian climatic zones of Chad have progressed southwards by 150 km.  

▪ Weak or lack of policies also lead to cumbersome administrative and organizational procedures in 
Chad. The Agriculture Sector Review Report (ASRR) highlighted the persistent lack of concrete 
measures to address effectively the major factors that impact food and nutritional security. In 
practice, efforts to address those factors are very limited, and often questioned. As an illustration, 
the ASRR proposed a process for  setting up a pastoral code, which has not moved forward even 
though there has been a resurgence of conflicts related to the access and control of natural

resources by different users. This situation of land insecurity is still limiting private investment 
and the sector’s performance. 

11. To address these constraints, the 2017 Agriculture Sector Review Report has identified improving 
productivity and strengthening resilience of family farming as effective and appropriate means of reducing 
poverty in rural areas. 

12. The Project will coordinate closely with other IDA-financed projects and projects being 
implemented by other partners to ensure effective synergies on the ground. For example, the Project will 
rely on the Chad Hydrological and Meteorological Services Modernization Project (P164256) to strengthen 
the capacity of the National Meteorology Agency (ANAM) to provide effective agro-meteorological 
services in support of the Project’s activities, including training and acquisition of digital solutions for data 
collection and analysis and weather forecasting (e.g. remote sensing application and GIS products). The 
Project will also complement interventions in pastoralism management being supported under the 
Regional Sahel Pastoralism Support Project (PRAPS – P147674). The Project will support mixed crops and 
livestock systems in agro-pastoral zones, while PRAPS will target purely pastoral zones. The Project will 
establish strategical and operational linkages with the Rural Mobility and Connectivity Project (P164747) 
which will be implemented in two out of the three targeted regions. This Project will to improve road 
access to selected agricultural production basin and markets in the Project area. Technologies to be 
introduced by the Project would also be used in the irrigation schemes developed by the Chad’s 
Component of the Sahel Irrigation Initiative Project (P154482). The is aligned with the Sahel Alliance 
Initiative which objective is to improve the support and coordination of development partners in the 
region to contribute effectively and more broadly to the stabilization and eradication of poverty, by 
developing rural areas, creating employment for youth, improving energy infrastructure and 
strengthening governance.  

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 

13. The proposed Project Development Objective (PDO) is “to promote the adoption of improved 
technologies leading to increase productivity and enhance the climate resilience of agricultural

D. Project Description  
 
The total project amount is the equivalent of USD 44.6 million (IDA grant of USD 41 million and beneficiaries contribution 
of USD 3.6 million) over a period of 5 years. The project consists of four components, namely: (A) Institutional support 
for sustainable agriculture development and climate resilience; (B) Supporting adoption of demand driven technologies 
and climate-smart agriculture; (C) Contingency emergency response; and (D) Coordination, knowledge management and 
monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL). 
 
COMPONENT A: INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT FOR SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE: 
This component is designed to strengthen institutional capacities for Agricultural Research & Development (AR&D) and 
climate change adaptation at national level. It includes the following sub-components : (A1) Strengthening the agricultural 
research and development (AR&D) system;  (A2) Strengthening of national support services for sustainable agricultural 
development and climate resilience and  (A.3) : Strengthening the framework for sectoral strategies and reforms 
preparation and monitoring    
 
COMPONENT B: SUPPORTING ADOPTION OF DEMAND DRIVEN TECHNOLOGIES AND CLIMATE-SMART AGRICULTURE: 
This component will support the adoption of high productivity potential and climate resilient technologies /practices. It 
is sub-divided into three sub-components: (B.1) Improving the effectiveness of agricultural support services in the 
targeted areas; (B.2) Accelerating adoption of improved technologies and innovations; and (B.3) Implementing climate-
smart agriculture plans.  
 
COMPONENT C: CONTINGENCY EMERGENCY RESPONSE 
This component will create a mechanism for financing emergency works in case of another disaster event by including a 
“zero-dollar” Contingency Emergency Response Component (CERC). Should this component be activated, it will allow 
rapid disbursement of funds to help reduce damage to infrastructure, ensure business continuity, and enable early 
rehabilitation. Following an adverse event that causes a major disaster, the GoC will be able to request that the Bank to 
channel resources from other components into an Immediate Response Mechanism (IRM). The IRM will enable the use 
of a portion of uncommitted funds from the overall IDA portfolio to respond to emergencies. To mobilize resources from 
the component, it will use the “Immediate Response Mechanism Operational Manual.”  

 

COMPONENT D: COORDINATION, M&E AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT 
This component is to support the Project on: (i) coordination and management, including human resources, financial 
management and procurement; (ii) M&E, gender impact evaluation and technical studies, (iii) knowledge management 
and communication; and (iv) safeguards and citizen engagement. The project will pilot the “Iterative Beneficiary 
monitoring” (IBM) System which is a simple low cost, high frequency feedback mechanism elaborated to inform regularly 
on what is not working during the project implementation and help to improve project results gradually and quickly 
without need of lengthy and expensive evaluations. 
 
E. Implementation 

 
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 

15. The project will be implemented under the supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation 
and Agricultural Equipment (MAIEA).  It will be supported by a National Steering Committee for all

F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 

The proposed Project will primarily target the Sudanian Agro-Ecological Zone of Chad, considered as high 
potential for agro-pastoral activities, but where the risk of food and nutritional security and rural poverty 
are of serious concern. The project's activities will be implemented in three (03) administrative regions, 
namely Salamat, Middle Chari and Mandoul located in the south-eastern pole of Chad. The project areas are 
home to about 1.55 million people, representing over 11% of the total population. Targeted regions are 
further characterized by high poverty rates of 70.9% in Mandoul, 61.4% in Middle Chari, and 48.4% in 
Salamat. In these communities, the average rate of fertility is estimated at about 6.5. In terms of natural and 
human resources, the targeted areas have significant agricultural potential, representing the Sudanese AEZ 
with annual average rainfall ranging between 800 to 1250 mm. However, the rainfall is highly variable in 
both inter-annual quantitates and in geographic distribution when moving from the south towards the 
north. Wooded Sudanian savanna constitutes the main vegetation in these areas, while relatively poor 
leached tropical ferruginous soils (on hills) and richer floodplains soils favorable to the culture of rice and all-
season vegetable production dominate the main soil types.

The Project is classified as category B project.   
As part of the project’s aim of improving agricultural 
productivity, the project will support the use of 
improved agricultural inputs including fertilizers, 
improved seeds, irrigation agriculture and pesticides 
that will require environmental assessment to 
ensure potential adverse effects are mitigated.  The 
project is expected to be beneficial to the 
environment given the aim is to ensure the impact 
of climate change is mitigated, adaptation measures 
implemented and resilience is built in to the 
production landscape.  The project will ensure that

Climate Resilient Agriculture and Productivity Enhancement Project (P162956) 

 

 

  
Jan 04, 2018 Page 10 of 18  

 

modern efficient utilization of pesticide and fertilizer 
will be introduced and farmers trained in their 
applications that will have a positive impact on the 
environment compared to the status quo. Further, a 
strict control mechanism will be put in place to avoid 
potential adverse impacts such as pollution from 
agricultural runoffs. An Environmental and Social 
Management Framework (ESMF) will be prepared by 
the borrower given that the exact detailed footprint 
types and locations of project activities and their 
respective sites have not yet been identified. The 
ESMF will be consulted upon and publicly disclosed, 
both in-country and at the InfoShop before 
appraisal.  In addition, for subprojects that are 
expected to be identified during preparation, an 
ESIA will be prepared by appraisal.   

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No 
The project is not expected to intervene in any 
critically natural habitats 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No The project will not support forest exploitation . 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

OP 4.09 is triggered based on project’ s activities to 
increase agricultural productivity which is expected 
to result in increased use of agrochemicals, such as 
pesticides. Any use of pesticides will be justified 
under the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) 
approach that will be promoted by the project. An 
Integrated Pest Management Plan (IPMP) will be 
developed, consulted upon by the borrower and 
publicly disclosed thereafter, both in-country and at 
the InfoShop before appraisal. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

Due to potential impacts on Physical Cultural 
Resources associated with civil works, the ESMF will 
include provisions of “Chance Finds” approach to 
ensure that these aspects will be taken into account 
in ESIAs/EMPs to be developed under the ESMF. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
There are no Indigenous Peoples People, as per the 
policy definition,  in the project area. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

This policy is triggered because the project 
investments may support interventions that could 
entail land taking or limiting access to land and other 
resources. Since details of the subproject footprints 
are still unknown at this very juncture, an RPF will be 
developed by the borrower, consulted upon and 
publicly disclosed, both in-country and at the 
InfoShop, before appraisal. Where and when 
warranted Full Resettlement Action Plans (FRAPs) or

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The environmental and social impacts and risks of the project activities are expected to be moderate to low, mostly 
site-specific and easily manageable to an acceptable level, typical of Category B projects. The potential negative 
environmental and social negative impacts and risks of the proposed project are associated with the implementation 
of Component 1 an 2, which are designed to support various activities for strengthening the agriculture research 
system and productive and resilient technology dissemination. These include: soil erosion due to agricultural 
developments; the spread of waterborne disease vectors and health risks associated with pesticide use, risks of 
increased prevalence of HIV/AIDS and other SCDs due to foreign workers on construction sites, the risk of pollution 
and environmental degradation byfertilizers and pesticides, reduced vegetation and pasture due to agricultural 
developments, etc. At the social level, though the project does not anticipate to physically display people, some of its 
proposed activities may require acquisition of land plots or restriction of access to productive natural resources, and/ 
or loss of incomes and livelihood resources without proper precautionary measures taken on time, could potentially 
lead to the involuntary resettlement of project affected persons (PAP). 
 
The proposed project triggers are OP/BP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), OP 4.09 (Pest Management),  OP/BP 4.11 
(Physical Cultural Resources); and OP/BP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement). In conformity with the World Bank' 
requirements and the Government's Environmental Impact Assessment legislation, an ESMF was prepared, amply 
consulted upon, along with a RPF, and a PMP. These were approved by the Ministry of Environment through a 
national validation workshop, cleared by the Bank and publicly disclosed both in-country and at the World Bank 
website prior to appraisal. 
 
No large-scale or irreversible adverse impacts and risks haves been identified during the participatory ESMF, IPMP and 
RPF analysis conducted. 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
No adverse long term impact and risk haves been identified during the EA process. Instead, the project is expected to 
deliver significant environmental and social benefits to hundred thousands of Chadians’ beneficiaries whose main 
livelihoods depend largely on agriculture crops and value. The adoption of improved technologies, the sustainable 
management practices of land and water as part of the formulation and implementation of climate-smart agriculture 
plans are expected to increase the productive capital of the land and the net carbon stock; and to increase the 
resilience of agro-sylvo-pastoral systems to climate risks. However, project activities to increase agricultural 



 

The World Bank  
Climate Resilient Agriculture and Productivity Enhancement Project (P162956) 

 

 

  
Jan 04, 2018 Page 12 of 18  

 

productivity could potentially induce indirect, but manageable impacts associated with increased use of 
agrochemicals, such as pesticides. These issues are addressed in the Pests and Pesticides Management Plan (PMP). 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
N/A 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The proposed project will be implemented by an new PIU under the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Agriculture 
Equipment. The Ministry has some experience in implementing the Bank’s safeguards policies as it has implemented 
the Agriculture Support Production Project (P126576). The Government of Chad (GoC) has completed the preparation 
of an ESMF, an PMP and a RPF to address issues related to the safeguard policies triggered. 
 
The ESMF outlines an environmental and social screening process for future sub-projects to ensure that they are 
environmentally sound and socially equitable, sustainably implementable, and in line with GoC and World Bank 
operational safeguards policies and guidelines on environmental and social impacts and risks management. The 
implementation cost of the ESMF is estimated at FCFA 502 million, is proposed to be included the overall project 
budget. 
 
A Pests and Pesticide Management Plan (IPMP) has been prepared based on project activities to increase agricultural 
productivity which is expected to result in increased use of agrochemicals, such as pesticides. The PMP action plan aim 
to ensure safe pests and pesticides management. It includes: (i) promoting the use of alternative pest management 
strategies in the project areas; (ii) strengthening of controls during importation of phytosanitary products; (iii) capacity 
building of key actors on the rational use of pesticides; (iv) sensitization of producers on good pesticide management 
practices (transport, storage, applying, safety measures);  (v) environmental monitoring of the physico-chemical 
quality of water resources (groundwater and ponds); (vi) health monitoring of pesticides users and management of 
empty containers; and (v) a coherent budget of FCFA 328.5 million proposed to be included in the overall project 
budget. 
 
The RPF sets forth the basic principles and procedures to be followed once the physical footprints of project activities 
are known in details to properly mitigate any potential adverse social impacts (i.e. preparation of site specific 
resettlement action plan-RAP, etc.). The RPF includes specifics such as valuation of assets, public consultation and 
participation, institutional arrangement, capacity building, monitoring and evaluation, grievance redress mechanism, 
budget and source of financing. CFA 192.5 million are proposed to support resettlement (RAP preparation, 
sensitization and training of key stakeholders), and to be included in the overall project cost. These do not include 
compensation costs which will be borne by the Government 
 
A 2-person team of Social and Environmental Safeguards Specialists (SESS) will be established at the PIU level to 
adequately handle the implementation of social and environmental recommendations. The SESS will work in tandem 
with the WBG safeguards specialists to ensure due compliance with core safeguards policies requirements. 
 
All bidding documents for civil works will have embedded environmental and social clauses (ESC), in order to enable 
contractors to follow up on environmental and social due diligence and to mitigate the anticipated negative risks and 
impacts. Depending of the type, scope/nature and size of construction, a supervising engineer (Bureau de contrôle) 
will be hired by the project to oversee the construction works (including implementation of environmental and social 
measures by the constructor) on behalf of the PIU. For small size construction type, the PIU will rely on the 



 

The World Bank  
Climate Resilient Agriculture and Productivity Enhancement Project (P162956) 

 

 

  
Jan 04, 2018 Page 13 of 18  

 

deconcentrated technical services like Génie Rural, Regional Directorate for Environmental, as well as local level Socio-
environmental Specialist, etc. to ensure due diligence on safeguards as described in the ESC. Regular Environmental 
Assessment and Pollution and Nuisance Control Directorate (DEELCPN) patrols will inspect the construction sites if the 
construction activities are in compliance with the approved site specific safeguards documents.  
 
The Borrower has some experience with the World Bank Safeguards policies’ requirements through several past and 
ongoing Bank funded projects. The proposed project will build on this experience and the 3 standalone safeguards 
instruments (ESMF, IPMP & RPF) include provisions to further strengthen the capacity of the various stakeholders. 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders identified are:  
• The Steering Committee (SC) : The Steering Committee will monitor the registry and budgeting of the 
environmental and social due diligence from the Work Plan and Annual Budget (WPAB) ; 
• The Project Management Unit (PMU):  The PMU will ensure that environmental and social aspects and issues 
are taken into account in the implementation of project activities. The PMU should benefit from capacity building in 
the implementation of the project;  
• The Environmental Assessment and Pollution and Nuisance Control Directorate (DEELCPN): it will review and 
approve the environmental classification of sub-projects and also approve  the Environmental and Social Impact 
Notices (ESIN). It will also participate in the external monitoring; 
• The research institutions will provide technical manuals of research findings and ecological monitoring of 
some activities. They will also participate in the preparation of manual of good agricultural practices. 
• The National Agency for Rural Development Support (ANADER) will be responsible for extension of good 
agricultural and environmental practices in the area; 
• The Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development will take care of the environmental and fish 
production monitoring; 
• Decentralized Technical Services (DTS or « STD » in French) : The STDs are composed by the Regional an 
Departmental Directorates of Ministries in charge of agriculture, of animal resources, of Health, of Environment. These 
regional and departmental directorates of the project's intervention zones will be associated to all activities 
implemented in their range and zones of action during and after the Project;  
• Municipalities :They will participate in environmental and social monitoring through their municipal technical 
services ; 
• The Regional Committees of Actions (CRA), the local Committees of Actions (CLA), the Departmental 
Committees of Actions (CDA), the National Council of Concertation of Rural Producers of Chad (CNCPRT), Asssociations 
of Farmers, Breeders and Fishermen. All these structures will also be involved in the implementation of the ESMF of 
the Project (identification of sub-projects, screening, etc.); 
• Construction companies :  They will be responsible for the implementation of the Site-ESMFs and the drafting 
of implementation reports of these ESMFs through their Environmental Expert ; 
• Owner’s Engineer : The Environmental Expert within their organization will be responsible for the day-to-day 
monitoring of the implementation of the site-ESMF and the drafting of an environmental and social monitoring report 
to submit to the Project Management Unit (PMU); 
• NGOs: In addition to social mobilization, they will participate in the sensitization of populations and the 
monitoring of the implementation of the ESMF interpellation of the principal actors of the Project. 
  
Throughout the entire process of project preparation, transparent and engaging stakeholder participation 
consultations were organized in the project intervention areas. The key concerns raised by the local stakeholders are 



 

The World Bank  
Climate Resilient Agriculture and Productivity Enhancement Project (P162956) 

 

 

  
Jan 04, 2018 Page 14 of 18  

 

related to land degradation issues that affect their livelihood, mainly the reduction of arable lands due to water 
erosion and silting of lowlands, lack of access to finance, and need for capacity building to improve agricultural 
practices. They have been incorporated in the project design (protection of watersheds from erosion and secure 
irrigation potential, Farmers 
Field School program, matching grant facility, etc.). Since stakeholder consultation and participation is an iterative 
process, it will be pursued and sustained throughout the project lifespan. 
As part of the ESMF, the IPMP and the RPF, in addition to the series of intensive local stakeholder meetings (open 
and/or focus groups discussions), a national stakeholders’ workshop was organized by the Client on to share the 
results of the safeguards instruments, mainstream ownership and seek inputs from the stakeholders. The 3 
standalone safeguards instruments, approved by the DEELCPN as result of this national stakeholders’ workshop, have 
been submitted to the Bank for final approval. They have been disclosed both in-country (Feb 23, 2017) and at the 
InfoShop (Feb. 22, 2018) prior to appraisal. The ESMF describes a comprehensive consultation and participation 
mechanism and disclosure during subprojects 
preparation.

Country Context
Benin is a low-income country of about ten million people (2013 population census) with a per 
capita income of US$820 in 2014.  The economy is driven by agriculture and services, 
particularly import/export activities through the Port of Cotonou. Agriculture accounts for 25 
percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 47 percent of the country's employment. Cotton is 
the primary export commodity. The informal sector, including subsistence agriculture, contributes 
up to 56 percent of GDP and engages over 90 percent of the labor force. Informal re-export to 
Nigeria contribute Â¼ of the government revenue (a part of that activity goes through formal 
channels for it to be able to generate so much of the government revenue). The country was able 
to maintain macroeconomic stability, which laid the foundation for accelerating growth. Real 
GDP grew by 4.6 percent in 2012; 6.9 percent in 2013; 6.5 percent in 2014; is estimated at 5.0 
percent in 2015; and is projected at 4.5 percent in 2016; which is higher than the previous 5-year 
average of 3.7 percent. Steady gross domestic product (GDP) growth of about 5 percent during 
the period (2012-2015) was partially offset by rapid population growth averaging 3.5 percent per 
year, which led to a modest and unequal increase in household consumption.  As a result, poverty 
levels grew from 36.2 percent in 2011 to 40.1 percent in 2015 . Growth was particularly modest 
in agriculture, which employs almost half the labor force. The economy remains poorly 
diversified and vulnerable to external shocks. This vulnerability underscores the need to promote 
economic diversification (including exports) as recommended in the 2013 Country Partnership 
Strategy (CPS) for Benin. Poverty reduction has been enshrined in successive poverty reduction 
strategies, but results have proven erratic and difficult to sustain. There are significant regional 
disparities in poverty rates, and while female-headed households have typically experienced 
lower poverty levels, women continue to suffer from a lack of economic opportunity, are 
underrepresented in politics and in other decision making positions, and are more susceptible to 
falling into poverty (Table 1). 
 
The disconnect between economic growth and poverty reduction during the last five years has 
been reinforced by the fact that higher growth stemmed mainly from more capital-intensive 
sectors like banking, telecommunications and the port. In contrast, agriculture, which employs 
half of the labor force, only grew at 4 percent per annum, with its growth derived from more land 
and more labor, but with modest increase in productivity. In addition, population growth has 
limited per capita growth and its impact on poverty reduction. Furthermore, Nigeria➢❨ s 
economic slowdown and policy changes have led to decreased opportunities for informal trade, 
both in the gas sector, where gas flows informally from Nigeria to Benin, and in the broader 
consumer goods sector, where rice, chicken, edible oil, used cars, used clothing etc., flow from 
Benin to Nigeria. For instance, the suppression of subsidies in Nigeria➢❨ s oil sector affected 
negatively the informal Beninese gas trade in areas adjacent to Benin➢❨ s border with Nigeria 
(Adjarra), where poverty increased from 34.8 percent in 2011 to 50.4 percent in 2015.
Sectoral and institutional Context
The agricultural sector in Benin is subject to the vagaries of climate and price fluctuations. 
Increase in productivity for major crops, including cotton has remained modest over time. Overall 
agricultural growth is around 4 percent, which is often offset by the relatively high population 
growth (3.5 percent). Yet, agriculture will remain one of the main source of growth and 
employment for the near future in the country. This will require higher and faster growth.  The 
past performance of 4% was insufficient to drive meaningful poverty reduction, due to the very 
high population growth. The agricultural production systems rely on an extension of cropped area 
and family labor, with no or limited use of improved inputs, production methods, and farm 



Page 3 of 11

equipment. Access to financing is limited outside the cotton system. The country➢❨ s agricultural 
trade performance is generally weak, with a persistently negative agricultural trade balance. 
Agricultural exports are concentrated on three groups of products: cotton, fruits (pineapple), and 
nuts and oilseed (cashew, soy and cottonseed). To meet the needs for a growing urban population, 
Benin continues to import a large share of horticultural products from neighboring countries (such 
as Burkina Faso and Nigeria), rice from Asia, wheat, frozen meat and milk from Europe, and 
frozen poultry products from Brazil. The sector faces the triple challenges of diversifying exports 
(consolidating cotton exports and increasing export volume for pineapple and cashew nut), 
increasing food production, and sustainably increasing farm and post-harvest productivity. These 
challenges must be addressed by taking into account the structural vulnerability of the 
country➢❨ s agricultural production system to floods and occasional droughts.  
 
Improving productivity and strengthening diversification are on the top of the agenda of the 
agricultural and overall development strategy in Benin. The agriculture sector strategy in Benin is 
defined within the broader framework of the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development 
Program (CAADP) by which the country commits to achieve a 6 percent growth in agriculture 
and to allocate at least 10 percent of the national budget to agriculture as recommended in the 
Maputo declaration . The country➢❨ s long-term development strategy (Benin 2025 - Alafia) 
establishes the long-term vision of the country and gives clear directions in relation to the 
promotion of agricultural value chains. The vision is that the country must move towards a greater 
diversification of agricultural production in order to become a major exporter of agricultural 
products by 2025. The achievement of this vision would require a sound public and private 
financing of agriculture and financial sector reforms that would support the promotion and 
implementation of specialized financing instruments for accelerated productivity growth and 
sustainable diversification in the agriculture sector.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Original Project Development Objective(s) - Parent
The Project Development Objective of the Agricultural Productivity and Diversification Project 
(PADA) is to restore and improve productivity and value addition for selected value chains in the 
Recipient's territory.

Key Results 
The key performance indicators will remain unchanged, although targets will need to be adjusted 
where necessary and new indicators will be introduced to account for the new activities and 
changes in corporate indicators. These new indicators include: (i) Number of farmers reached 
with assets or services  of whom 40 percent are women; (ii) Farmers adopting improved 
agricultural technology; (iii) Number of micro projects transformed into SMEs. The end date for 
all targets will also be extended to February 28,2021, in line with the proposed revised Closing 
Date of the original project. .

D.  Project Description

The proposed Additional Financing (AF) will be used to support the government of Benin in 
consolidating and scaling-up the achievements of the initial project, and to strengthen the project 
focus on income generating activities for poor households as well as improving their nutritional 
status.

II. Implementation
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements
There will be no major change to the implementation arrangements. The Project Coordination Unit 



Page 5 of 11

(PCU) is currently composed of staff who have been recruited based on the skills needed for the 
various positions. Given the nature of the scaling up and new activities, the PCU will include an 
additional animal production specialist. In addition, given the strategic orientation of the Programme 
Cadre-ProCAD  that hosts the PCU, some additional staff will be recruited with cost sharing between 
PADA and WAAPP: (i) an operations officer; (ii) a finance controller; (iii) a computer and 
information management specialist; (v) a logistics management specialist; (iv) an accountant; and (v) 
two administrative assistants.  
 
Financial Management (FM). The proposed AF will build on the existing institutional and fiduciary 
arrangements of the Project Coordination Unit of PADA under oversight of the Ministry of 
Agriculture. The overall performance of the PADA in financial management is Satisfactory. Staffing 
is adequate but needs to be strengthened with a Financial Controller and proper books of accounts 
and supporting documents have been kept in respect of all expenditures. The PCU is familiar with 
the Bank FM requirements and has demonstrated solid technical and fiduciary capacities to manage 
Bank-financed Projects. The audit for the year ended December 31, 2015 for the PADA was 
submitted on time, and was unqualified. The interim un-audited financial reports (IFR) are prepared 
every quarter and regularly submitted to the Bank on time.  
 
The overall FM risk of the Agricultural Productivity and Diversification Project including the 
proposed additional financing is rated Moderate. It is considered that the financial management 
satisfies the Bank➢❨ s minimum requirements under OP/BP 10.00, and therefore is adequate to 
provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely financial management information on the 
status of the project required by the Bank.  
 
Procurement. The New Procurement Framework (including Procurement Regulations for Borrowers) 
that apply to projects with PCN held after July 1st, 2016 will normally apply. Given the fact that 
waiver has been obtained from CPO to apply the old procurement Guidelines, procurement 
arrangements of the original project will remain largely the same under the proposed Additional 
Financing in accordance with: (a) the World Bank➢❨ s ➢❨ Guidelines: Procurement of Goods, 
Works, and Non-Consulting Services under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants➢❨  dated 
January 2011; revised July 2014, and (b) ➢❨ Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants 
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants by World Bank Borrowers➢❨  dated January 2011, 
revised July 2014.  Although procurement on PADA has been quite challenging, the PCU has 
conducted procurement activities for the original project in a satisfactory manner.  
 
Environmental and Social Safeguards. The AF triggers: OP/BP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment; 
OP4.09 on Pest Management; OP/PB4.11 On Physical Cultural Resources and OP/BP 4.12 on 
Involuntary Resettlement. The original project was rated as environmental assessment Category 
➢❨ B➢❨  so as the proposed AF. The environmental and social impacts of the Project are expected to 
be moderate, site specific, and manageable. The Project is expected to have a positive environmental 
impact through its support for agricultural technologies that promote the better use of land and water 
resources. Potential environmental risks could include point and nonpoint pollution of water sources, 
and other issues associated with the use of agricultural chemicals, and negative environmental 
impacts associated with the rehabilitation of irrigation or small-scale civil works. The parent 
project➢❨ s safeguards documents (Environmental and Social Management Framework-ESMF, Pest 
Management Plan-PMP and Resettlement Policy Framework-RPF) have been adapted and updated to 
include activities planned under the AF. Thereafter, all the three safeguard instruments have been 
consulted upon and disclosed in-country on February 03, 2017 and at the Infoshop on February 03, 



Page 6 of 11

2017. The latest implementation support mission (December, 2016) rated the safeguard compliance 
Satisfactory, based on review of progress reports and project site visits. The Project Management 
Unit has an extensive experience in Bank➢❨ s safeguards policies and a dedicated team has been 
appointed to follow up on environmental and social issues; especially the implementation of the 
safeguards instruments. In addition, the national body in charge of environmental and social 
management plans (ESMPs) implementation monitoring (ABE Agence Beninoise pour 
l➢❨ Environnement) will ensure the compliance with national legislation while Bank➢❨ s safeguards 
specialists guide and provide guidance to the PIU through regular supervision missions.

III. Safeguard Policies that might apply

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental 
Assessment OP/BP 
4.01

Yes The ongoing Additional Financing intends to finance small 
equipment to ensure proper use of irrigation facilities (sub-
component 2-1). More specifically, the project under sub-
component 2-2, will also fund the construction and 
rehabilitation of critical market and storage infrastructures: (i) 
cold chamber for pineapple packaging and storage before 
export; (ii) construction of centers of bulking up in pineapple 
production areas and distribution centers of pineapple to 
expand domestic marketing of pineapple; (iii) construction of 
25 warehouses to support the bulk marketing of cashew nuts; 
(iv) construction and equipment of 10 cashew apple juice 
processing units to support income-generating activities for 
women based on good results of the initial phase; (v) 
construction of 100 threshing and drying areas for rice to 
improve quality and marketability of the final product; and (vi) 
construction and equipment of fresh fish distribution centers. 
These several civil works will potentially impact 
environmental and social components. However, the exact 
locations of these investments were not determined with 
certainty an Environment and Social Management Framework
(ESMF) has been developed, reviewed, consulted upon and 
disclosed within the Benin on February 03,2017 and at the 
World Bank➢❨ s Website on February 03, 2017

Natural Habitats OP/
BP 4.04

No This policy is not triggered as there will be no potential impact 
on natural habitats.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No The project is not expected to have any impact on forests.
Pest Management OP 
4.09

Yes The Additional Financing of PADA aims also at increasing the 
agricultural productivity. By this way, it is expected that 
farmers use fertilizers to improve soil fertility and pesticides to 
fight against pests and predators. To handle in a proper manner 
the potential use of these chemical products, the borrower has 
prepared a Pest Management Plan (PMP). After its preparation, 
PMP has been reviewed by the Bank, consulted upon and 
disclosed within Benin on February 03, 2017 and on the 
Bank➢❨ s website on February 03, 2017.

Physical Cultural 
Resources OP/BP 
4.11

Yes The civil works associated with activities will unquestionably 
involve excavations within the framework of the construction 
of new infrastructures with the probability to discover cultural 
resources. However, no specific safeguard instrument is 
required. The ESMFthat has been prepared includes a chapter 
in order to provide guidance in case of such discoveries.

Indigenous Peoples 
OP/BP 4.10

No There are no indigenous people as defined by the Bank within 
the Benin

Involuntary 
Resettlement OP/BP 
4.12

Yes The project could involve land take. To be in full compliance 
with the policy, the borrower has prepared a Resettlement 
Policy Framework (RPF) that has  also been reviewed, 
consulted upon, disclosed in-country on February XXX, 2017 
and at the World Bank➢❨ s Website February XXX, 2017.

Safety of Dams OP/
BP 4.37

No The project will not finance any dam construction.

Projects on 
International 
Waterways OP/BP 
7.50

No The project will not finance any activities with impacts on 
international waterways.

Projects in Disputed 
Areas OP/BP 7.60

No The project will not finance any activities in disputed areas.

IV. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify 

and describe any potential large scale,  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
There are no significant or irreversible adverse impacts that are expected from the implementation 
of activities that will be financed under this AF. Most of the adverse environmental and social 
impacts associated with these investments will be small-scale and site-specific.  Hence, they will 
be manageable at an acceptable level. 
 
The project remains EA category B and triggers four safeguards policies namely OP/PB 4.01; 
OP4.09;OP/PB4.11 and OP/PB 4.12.  Safeguard instruments (ESMF, IPMP and RPF) have all 
been updated and will be implemented as guidance/guidelines for the activities during the 
Additional Financing phase.  
 
During the parent project➢❨ s implementation, Overall safeguard compliance (OP/BP 4.01 on 
Environmental Assessment; OP4.09 on Pest Management and OP/BP 4.12 on Involuntary 
Resettlement) is rated Moderately Satisfactory.  All safeguard documents have been prepared and 
disclosed in accordance with national legislation and Bank policies.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities 
in the project area:
The assessment of potential environmental and social adverse impacts does not foresee long-term 
impacts associated to this project.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 



Page 8 of 11

impacts.
N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
Given that the exact location of future investments are not yet known and activities are diversified, 
the borrower has prepared an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF). That 
safeguard instrument contains standards, methods, and procedures specifying how future activities 
whose location, number, and scale are unknown will systematically address environmental and 
social issues.  It includes procedures for screening and mitigating impacts from construction and 
operation of the irrigation schemes, and includes the following: (a) checklists of potential 
environmental and social impacts and their sources; (b) procedures for participatory screening of 
proposed sites and activities and the environmental and social considerations; (c) procedures for 
assessing potential environmental and social impacts of the planned project activities; (d) 
institutional arrangements for mitigating, preventing, and managing the identified impacts; (e) 
typical environmental management planning process for addressing negative externalities in the 
course of project implementation; (f) a system for monitoring the implementation of mitigation 
measures; and (g) recommended capacity building measures for environmental planning and 
monitoring of project activities. 
 
To manage land acquisition, involuntary resettlement or loss of livelihoods induced by the 
implementation of activities and other sub-projects, the client has developed a Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF).  That safeguard instrument clarifies the principles, organizational 
arrangements, and design criteria to be applied to investments/sub-projects to be prepared during 
project implementation. Investment-specific Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) will be prepared, as 
necessary, in line with the RPF and submitted to the Bank for approval.  
 
The PMP encourages the use of organic fertilizers and biological technics to fight against 
agriculture predators. In addition to that, It sets up guidance and guidelines with the aim to protect 
population health and environment integrity in promoting best practices in the case of use of 
chemical products. 
 
All the above safeguard documents provide detailed mitigation measures to ensure sustainability 
and compliance with Benin➢❨ s regulations and legislations, as well as with the World Bank 
environmental and social safeguard policies. 
 
Activities financed under the project will be screened using a standardized approach based on the 
tools developed under the original project.  ESIA including ESMPs will be prepared as needed for 
the small civil works expected to be undertaken under this AF.  For works with negligible impacts 
environmental measures based on national laws and regulations will apply. 
 
The PIU includes currently an environmental specialist who is responsible for safeguards 
implementation. Moving forward, under this AF, the same staff will continue to oversee the 
implementation of the project safeguards instruments and coordinate efforts at the national level. 
Moreover, the PIU staff will continue to regularly monitor and follow-up with any safeguard 
issues with the assistance of the ABE(Agence Beninoise de l➢❨ Environnement) involved since 
the beginning of the parent project in ESMPs implementation monitoring. Lastly, the Bank➢❨ s 
implementing support missions will also continue to include environmental and social safeguard 
specialists.



Page 9 of 11

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Stakeholders concerned by the AF are constituted by farmers, breeders, fishermen, NGOs, and 
ministries in charge of Agriculture, Livestock, Water, Forestry, Environment and land 
management. During the safeguard instruments preparation, these various stakeholder groups have 
been consulted. During the updating of the safeguards documentation, new series of consultations 
were held where all of these stakeholders have been consulted and their recommendations, 
comments and suggestions taken into account in the safeguards documents finalization. The latest 
consultation in the process of safeguard instruments preparation was the workshop held in 
Bohicon from December 13 to 16, 2016 at Hotel Fifatin.

 Country Context 
 

Rwanda is a small (26,000 km2) landlocked country with few natural resources and a population 

of 10.7 million (2012) and projected population of 13 million by 2020.  Its hilly terrain covers 85 

percent of the land mass and the country has the highest population density in Africa with 416 

people per square kilometer, with 53 percent of them female. Rwanda has made a remarkable 

transition from genocide to peace and development. Between 2000 and 2012, GDP growth 

averaged 8.1 percent per year. Development efforts and results have been significant. Rwanda 

experienced 14 percentage points reduction in the poverty headcount, from 59 percent in 2001 to 

45 percent in 2011 and with the remaining poor on average much closer to the poverty line in 

2011 than in 2001. Developments in agriculture were key drivers of this poverty reduction 

accounting for more than 45 percent in total due to increased agriculture production (35 percent) 

and increased agriculture commercialization (10 percent). Self-employment in small off-farm 

non-agriculture business accounted for an additional 13 percent of poverty reduction. Part of this 

self-employment was associated with agriculture value chain employment. 

 

Despite this impressive performance in the last decade and particularly in the last 5 years, 

significant challenges remain. While improving, Rwanda remains a low income country with 

annual per capita income of US$644 in 2012 (with more than 45 percent below the national 

poverty line). About one in four rural households live in extreme poverty. Poverty is still mostly 

a rural phenomenon with 49 percent of the poor in rural areas compared to 22 percent in urban 

areas. Poverty is highest (76.6 percent) among households (often landless) who obtain more than 

half of their income from working on other people’s farms. The land distribution is skewed – 36 

percent of households own 6 percent of farm land, with an average of 0.1 ha per household 

(compared to the national average of .33 ha per household). Women are more likely to fall into 

this category.  In addition, women provide the bulk of labor in the crop sector, but function

mainly at subsistence level with insufficient skills, access to markets and control over land and 

other agricultural services. If Rwanda is to achieve its targets to reduce the number of people 

living below the national poverty line to less than 20 percent and eliminate extreme poverty by 

the year 2020, continuation of the past strong growth performance will not be sufficient. A 

further acceleration of inclusive growth would be needed, on top of further reductions in 

inequality. 

 

The strategy for stimulating rapid and sustainable economic growth and reducing poverty is 

articulated in Rwanda’s Vision 2020. Vision 2020 is the national vision and policy framework 

which articulates key priorities for the country’s development by the year 2020. This vision is 

further laid out in the Second Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper 

(EDPRS 2) which delineates the agriculture sector as a key sector and a significant engine of 

inclusive growth for the country. Likewise, in the recent report Rwanda Economic Update, 

Maintaining Momentum it states that increasing agriculture productivity is the main driver of 

poverty reduction in Rwanda. Agricultural transformation, especially through competitive value 

chain development, is expected to boost growth in both the formal and informal sectors, with the 

effect of reducing the proportion of the population dependent on agriculture from the present 73 

percent (2009) to less than 50 percent in 2020. In addition, while agricultural productivity is 

increasing, there is considerable potential to accelerate and continue to raise productivity, 

increase commercialization of agriculture production, increase self-employment in small on and 

off-farm business and achieve significant poverty reduction, income gains and increased 

prosperity.  Gender equity and equality has also been highlighted as a foundational and cross-

cutting issue under EDPRS 2 and the Third Phase of the Transformation of Agriculture Sector 

Program (known by its French acronym, PSTA 3) building on a solid foundation with the highest 

percent of women in parliament in the world at 64 percent and 32 percent women's participation 

in all decision-making local government bodies. Accordingly, the Government of Rwanda (GoR) 

has made a strong commitment to continue to increase gender equity and equality particularly at 

the local level, and is determined to see it well integrated in government policies and programs at 

all levels. 
 

 

 Sectoral (or multi-sectoral) and Institutional Context 
 

Accounting for 32.7 percent of the GDP (2015), agriculture is a critical driver of economic 

growth (7.6 percent, 2000-15) and poverty reduction, contributing to 35 percent of the total 

decline in poverty rates over the past decade. A well-established policy framework, facilitating 

enhanced access to better agricultural inputs, has greatly contributed to the positive agriculture 

sector performance.  As a result, the total production of cassava and maize, as well as milk, meat, 

fish and eggs, more than doubled between 2005 and 2015. 

 

Despite these positive developments, Rwanda has yet to meet its production potential. Although 

key agricultural yields have greatly increased since 2000 (e.g. cereal and cassava yields have 

trebled, sweet potato yields have doubled etc.), they reached a plateau in 2011. At their current 

levels, they are estimated to be at 40-50 percent of their productivity potential, resulting from 

suboptimal use of production factors. Similarly, livestock yields have remained consistently low 

over time. 

 

A contributing factor is small farm size – a rural household, on average, cultivates 0.6 ha, and 

http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2015/05/14/090224b082c25de1/1_0/Rendered/PDF/Rwanda0economi0nd0Poverty0Reduction.pdf

has 2-5 animals – and 96 percent of rural households are directly reliant on agriculture as their 

main or only source of income. The projected increase in the rural population, an estimated 

additional 2.5-3.5 million people by 2032, is likely to add more pressure on land resources and 

farm incomes, unless alternative employment opportunities become available. 

 

In addition, Rwanda remains challenged by malnutrition, with a stunting rate of 37.9 percent, 

while its food security index lies below the average of the Sub-Saharan African countries. Some 

20 percent (2015) of Rwandan households remain food insecure, and most of them are located in 

the western and northern parts of the country. 

 

 

 Program Scope 
 

The proposed operation supports the Government of Rwanda’s strategic objectives of the 

Transformation of Agriculture Sector Program Phase 3 with aims to enhance food security and 

nutrition contributing to a reduction in poverty and inclusive economic growth. The operation 

supports four broad program areas: (i) agriculture and animal resource intensification; (ii) 

research, technology transfer and professionalization of farmers; (iii) value chain development 

and private sector investment; and (iv) institutional development and agricultural cross-cutting 

issues. 
 

 

 Program Development Objective(s) 
 

The program development objective (PDO) is to increase and intensify the productivity of the 

Rwandan agricultural and livestock sectors and expand the development of value chains. 
 

 

 Environmental and Social Effects 
 

The Additional Financing (AF) will introduce a new disbursement-linked indicator (DLI) on the 

development of an updated National Agricultural Policy (NAP) and increase several of the 

existing DLI targets. Increasing the DLI targets and incorporating a new DLI will support GoR’s 

on-going efforts to maximize the productivity of the agriculture sector while transforming the 

overarching policy environment. 

 

The updated NAP will provide an overarching vision for the agriculture sector. It will place 

significant emphasis on sustainable production and food security. However, the policy will not 

include specific policy instruments. Individual policy instruments for all sub sectors will be 

reviewed, revised, or developed. All policies will need to be compliant with the principles 

outlined in the NAP (including those of protecting the environment while maintain food 

security). This approach ensures that sustainable practices will be mainstreamed throughout all 

sub sectoral policies. 

 

The assessment of these adjustments to the Program is as follows: 

 

a) DLIs that are focused on improving the productivity of land and increasing the 
productivity of key crops (DLI 1, 2, 3 and 4) will not induce new environmental and

social risks but may request to pay more attention to potential direct, indirect or 

cumulative risk generated from activities such as expansion of irrigation, as some 

irrigation structures will include canals, as well as small dams. As with any irrigation 

structure, these dams may have safety-related risks, which were effectively managed by 

the GoR during RSSP investment projects. Other potential impacts include water quality 

and quantity degradation (both surface and ground water), surface water sedimentation, 

and spread of waterborne diseases. 

b) Inclusion of DLI 8 focusing on the production of an updated NAP which will integrate 
new initiatives, such as the climate smart Agriculture and Information Communication 

Strategy, which could benefit environmental management.  

 

The level of risk remains moderate and can be addressed through: (i) the existing GoR 

Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) including the small dam safety 

guidelines and the Environmental and Social Implementation Manual (ESIM). The process for 

rolling out the ESIM to all Districts is part of the on-going decentralization process. The rollout 

to 30 Districts is expected to be concluded by September 2017; and (ii) exclusion of high-risk 

interventions which include activities that are judged likely to have significant adverse impacts 

on the environment and/or affected people. Among these high-risks interventions are dam 

construction/irrigation or drainage infrastructures on transboundary water resources. 

 

While the existing ESMS is adequate, it will be strengthened to further benefit and improve the 

GoR’s understanding of social issues in the following areas by: 

 

 Strengthening measures to enhance GoR’s capacity to implement the ESMS Program. As 
a result, this new action includes a “capacity building program based on the ESIM, and 

the small dam safety guidelines” to benefit the District officers. This program will ensure 

that: (a) the ESIM has sufficient guidelines on small dams; and (b) all relevant staff are 

trained in the ESIM. The manual and training program will be prepared by involving the 

relevant MINAGRI SPIU teams which are already conversant with the safeguards 

policies; and implemented before the end of the Program. 

 

 The Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) database will be fully functional (including 
relevant staff training) within MINAGRI by July, 2017. This will be supported by the 

development of a communication strategy (included in the updated PAP) to ensure there 

is awareness of the database and that the outcomes of grievances are made public.

gap to US$22.6 million. 

 

 

 Program Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 
 

The Public Sector 

 

The lead government ministry for the agriculture sector is MINAGRI.  Organizationally, it is 

composed of four main entities as follows: 

 

MINAGRI Central guides policy, strategy and key programs for the Ministry. It comprises the 

Minister and Principal Secretary, and four departments/directorates: Planning, Inspection, Crop 

Production, and Animal Resources. 

 

Rwanda Agricultural Board (RAB) is a semi-autonomous implementation agency of MINAGRI 

that is responsible for promoting food crop production. It has a national network of research 

stations, projects and staff that focus on improved production and yields of food staple crops. It 

has agronomists based in four zones corresponding to the four provinces, and who are 

responsible for expanding farmer access to enhanced extension services. The RAB is also 

responsible for all research and certification of seeds and houses two Task Forces (Irrigation and 

Post-Harvest Infrastructure) which will be assimilated within MINAGRI’s structure as of July 1, 

                                                                                                                                                             
resources, but would mean switching modalities from either sector budget support or project financing to programmatic 

financing (PforR). Apart from DfID, no other donors are providing programmatic support through co-financing of the PforR or 

participation in the MDTF. 



6 

 

2014 as they have completed their mandates; 

 

National Agricultural Export Board (NAEB) is similarly a semi-autonomous implementation 

agency of MINAGRI that is responsible for export crop production. It has concentrated in the 

past on coffee and tea, but is broadening its mandate to cover and expand horticulture and non-

traditional export crops. It also has a national network of projects and staff focusing on improved 

production, yields and competitiveness of export crops. It also has agronomists based in some 

districts and on plantations responsible for expanding farmer access to improved extension 

services in support of increasing export crops. 

 

Single Project Implementation Units (SPIUs) were established to ensure efficient and timely 

implementation of a large portfolio of donor funded projects and are headquartered at MINAGRI 

Central.  Most of the projects being implemented by the SPIUs cover most of the 24 SPs. Three 

SPIUs are responsible for managing projects/operations funded by three key DPs: (i) IFAD 

funded projects: the Kirehe District Water Management Programme; Project for Rural Income 

Through Exports; Climate Resilent Post-harvest and Agribusiness Support Project (PASP); (ii) 

AfDB-funded Projects: Bugesera Natural Rural Region Infrastructure Support Project; Livestock 

Infrastructure Support Project; and (iii) World Bank funded projects: LWH (basket fund), RSSP 

3, and the FRDP. 

 

In addition to MINAGRI, six additional government ministries have significant responsibilities 

in the agriculture sector, as follows: 

 

The Ministry of Local Government (MINALOC) is responsible for 30 Districts, which in turn, 

are responsible for expanding local level service delivery. They promote agriculture development 

as part of their responsibility for local economic development. Funds are earmarked in District 

budgets for implementation of MINAGRI priorities as defined in PSTA 3 (currently 10 percent 

of MINAGRI’s total budget). Although these resources pass directly to the Districts from 

MINECOFIN, they form part of MINAGRI’s overall budget ceiling and programs. Each District 

and sector has an agronomist that is responsible for local level implementation of agriculture 

activities. These agronomists work closely with RAB and NAEB agronomists who work in the 

Districts. The on-going local government restructuring exercise is expected to further expand 

fiscal decentralization, including expanded earmarking of funds from MINAGRI and other 

central ministries, and strengthen local government implementation capacities. The 

implementation of the ASIP, as well as PforR program will involve expanded roles of the local 

government actors, while also restructuring central government organizational and staffing 

structures to be more supportive of these decentralization changes/reforms. MINALOC also 

collaborates on implementation of the National Nutrition policy with MINAGRI, ensuring 

community training and service provisions to improve nutrition outcomes. 

 

The Ministry of Natural Resources (MINIRENA) is responsible for state forests around the 

country, although MINAGRI is responsible for on-farm agroforestry. MINIRENA is also 

responsible for environmental protection and in this capacity has its own programs of hillside 

terrace construction, which reinforce the land conservation terracing that MINAGRI undertakes. 

MINIRENA is also responsible for the RNRA water resources department, and seeks closer 

collaboration with MINAGRI. 

 

The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MINICOM) has the key responsibility of promoting 



7 

 

business and trade growth and development, including expanded agribusiness. It leads the 

development of policy and strategy to accomplish Rwanda’s goal of an expanding, competitive 

and healthy private sector. 

 

The Ministry of Infrastructure’s (MININFRA) Rwanda Transport Development Agency (RTDA) 

has the responsibility of supporting Districts and monitoring implementation of feeder roads 

rehabilitation, upgrading and maintenance. RTDA works closely with the Districts in 

procurement, contract management and management of social and environmental systems.  In 

addition, MININFRA/RTDA provides guidance on technical standards and specifications.   

 

The Rwanda Development Board (RDB) is responsible for investment promotion in Rwanda. 

Although it concentrates on foreign direct investment (FDI), it also promotes local investment. It 

brings together all the government agencies responsible for investment under one roof. This 

includes key agencies responsible for business registration, investment promotion, environmental 

clearances, privatization and specialist agencies which support the priority sectors of 

Information, Communication and Technology (ICT) and tourism as well as Small and Medium 

Enterprises (SMEs) and human capacity development in the private sector. RDB has a 

substantial portfolio of agriculture and agri-business investment projects which it is promoting 

for private sector-driven investment, including expanding the public and private partnerships. 

 

The Rwanda Development Bank (RDB) is the government’s main investment arm and offers 

long and medium-term loans. The GoR is pursuing privatization of the Bank and has signed an 

MOU with a prospective investor. In April 2014 the RDB had an agriculture and agri-business 

loan portfolio of RWF 33.3 billion accounting for a significant proportion of the Bank’s total 

lending. Most agricultural loans were for coffee and tea production and processing and the 

import of fertilizer. On May 16, 2014 the International Finance Corporation (IFC) issued its first 

bond denominated in Rwandan francs, raising RWF 15 billion (about US$22 million) to expand 

the availability of long-term local-currency finance for local businesses through the RDB. 

 

The Private Sector 

 

In addition to the public sector agriculture entities, there are two organizations dedicated to 

supporting private sector actors in agriculture as follows: 

 

The Private Sector Federation (PSF) is the representative umbrella body for the private sector in 

Rwanda and advocates and dialogues with government for policies and programs which will 

promote the growth of the private sector. Amongst its objectives are business promotion and 

development, building private sector capacity and effective private sector advocacy. It is 

composed of nine chambers, including the Chamber of Rwanda Farmers. The Chamber conducts 

a program to train farmers and build entrepreneurship. The member associations of the Chamber 

cover most of the major agricultural commodities produced in Rwanda. 

 

The Rwanda Cooperative Agency (RCA) is the representative body for the cooperative 

movement in Rwanda. There are 1,953 agricultural and 1,307 livestock cooperatives operating as 

farmer associations involved in crop production, agricultural savings and credit, livestock 

development and processing and marketing of outputs. RCA promotes the interests of the 

cooperative movement and runs support and training programs in helping cooperatives function 

and perform as private sector entities

B. Introduction and Context 

 
Country Context 

 
1. Chad is sparsely populated, with only 13 million people, and vast in size (being more than 1 million km²). 
It is a low-income country, with a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of about US$823 in 2018, and, has 
among the lowest human development indicators in the world. The country is divided into 23 regions located in 
three main geographical zones: a desert zone in the north, an arid Sahelian belt in the center, and a more fertile 
Sudanese savanna zone in the south. It faces adverse climate conditions including prolonged droughts in some 
areas and yearly flows in others, as well as wind erosion, and desertification, leading to recurrent food crises, as 
well as population displacement. Combined with security risks due to political instability and transit through Chad 
by terrorist groups such as Boko Haram, and al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), as well as an uptick in 
migration, urban populations are projected to reach nearly 6 million by 2030, or 27 percent of the total population. 
Chad is home to an estimated 450,000 displaced people, the large majority of which are refugees1.  
 

2. The economy is largely dominated by agriculture and extractive industries, mainly oil. However, the 
recent fall in oil prices has had a dramatic impact on an economy in which oil accounted for 30 percent of total 
GDP and 70 percent of Government revenues in 2017. Almost half (47 percent) of the population was living under 
the national poverty line in 2011, the most recent year for which poverty numbers are available. The high level of 
poverty is accompanied by low human development, and Chad currently ranks 157 out of 157 in the recent World 
Bank Human Capital Index (HCI) with an index estimated at 0.29 meaning that Chad is losing 71 percent of its 
potential productivity. Life expectancy at birth is 51.9 years, expected years of schooling is 7.3 years, and mean 

                                                           
1 Based on the UNHCR definition refugees are people who are recognized as refugees under the 1951 Convention Relating to the 
Status of Refugees or its 1967 Protocol, the 1969 Organization of African Unity Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of 
Refugee Problems in Africa, people recognized as refugees in accordance with the UNHCR statute, people granted refugee-like 
humanitarian status, and people provided temporary protection. Asylum seekers--people who have applied for asylum or refugee 
status and who have not yet received a decision or who are registered as asylum seekers--are excluded. Country of asylum is the 
country where an asylum claim was filed and granted.

years of schooling stands at just 2.3 years. Education attainment is highly unequal with people in the wealthiest 
quintile having an average of 6.7 years of schooling, compared with 1.0 for those in the poorest quintile. 

 

3. Two thirds of the population are less than 25 years old and the proportion of young people will continue 
to increase dramatically in the coming years. Those under the age of 24 will continue to grow faster than the rest 
of the population through 2050 creating an even bigger “youth bulge.” The growing population and increasing 
dependency ratios are challenging for increasing employment, improving productivity, and adequately providing 
public services. The high population growth rate alone will result in extreme pressure on the health and education 
sectors, requiring a continuous increase in expenditures just to maintain coverage. The “youth bulge” will lead to 
a sharp rise in the number of young people seeking employment, and urbanization will push and increasing 
proportion of these youth to seek employment outside of the agricultural sector, though this increase is slow, and 
the majority will remain in informal work in agriculture.  

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

Sector Context  

4. Low education and literacy levels are severe constraints to a productive labor force. The education 
system in Chad is subdivided into early childhood education (almost inexistent, gross enrolment rate (GER) of 2%), 
six years of primary education, four years of lower secondary education, three years of upper secondary 
education, and higher education. However, according to the DHS 2014-15, almost half (46 percent) of primary-
school-age children in Chad did not attend school. Stark gender and regional inequalities remain, with a gender 
parity rate at 0.75. For those who do attend school, low learning outcomes are a perennial challenge, with only 
15.7 percent of sixth graders equipped with sufficient competency in reading according to the 2014 PASEC results. 
The low supply of science and technology skills is particularly acute, with just 67 girls nationally enrolled in 
mathematics and science tracks in the last year of upper secondary – or 0.1 percent of the total baccalaureate 
candidates.  
 

5. While the unemployment rate for the working age population is low in Chad (as in other parts of SSA), 
the youth unemployment rate is notably higher. It was estimated at around 9 percent for both 2016 and 2017 
with young women more likely to be unemployed (at a rate of 10.6 percent). Comparatively, the working age 
population unemployment rate is estimated at 5.8 percent in 2017 up from 5.7 percent in 20162. Educated youth 
and youth in urban areas appear to be more likely to be unemployed, and if Chadians are working, the quality of 
their jobs tends to be low.  According to ECOSIT 3 data, more than 35 percent of the working age population is 
underemployed, especially in rural areas (36.4 percent, compared to 27.2 percent in urban areas). 

 

6. A high concentration of the labor force in self-employed informal and low-productivity operations. Most 
of the workers are in the informal sector which represents 95 percent of the workforce. Jobs in the informal sector 
are highly vulnerable, with low earnings, and low dependability. Even outside of agriculture, 60 percent of jobs 
are in the informal sector. Of the 400,000 informal establishments outside of agriculture, most are engaged in 
trade and repair of vehicles or equipment, followed by manufacturing of food and beverages.  As above, 
underemployment remains a major challenge. Within the informal sector 39.2 percent of the workers in the non-
agricultural sector are estimated to be underemployed vs. 40.2 percent for agricultural workers.

7. The agriculture sector employs 80 percent of the Chadian workforce and accounts for 52 percent of 
GDP. It is also the second largest source of export income for the country after oil. The Government has, among 
other actions, prioritized the industrialization of agriculture with the aim of boosting exports to diversify the 
economy, but the sector is struggling to modernize and remains largely dependent on weather conditions3. Family 
farming often has low productivity and profitability and lacks resilience to shocks. While lack of equipment and 
technology contribute to low productivity and profitability, low education levels and lack of skills are also key 
determinants. Support for more productive self-employment and diversification of rural livelihoods is critical to 
supporting the high proportion of vulnerable rural Chadians.  

 

8. A multi-tier system of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) exists, with several 
institutions that focus on providing differing levels of skills but is complex and poorly coordinated. Students at 
the lower secondary level can seek a DFFTP (Diplôme de Fin de Formation Technique et Professionnelle) which is 
awarded after two years of vocational study at a technical college. Students who pass the exit examination at the 
end of the lower secondary cycle can also enroll in a three-year program taught in a lycée technique, leading to 
the degree of BT. Students who successfully complete middle school can also seek a BEP degree which can be 
obtained with two years of technical or vocational training in a college technique following successful completion 
of middle school. The technical and vocational education sector includes two industrial technical high schools, 
four industrial technical secondary schools, twenty-one high schools specialized in commerce. In addition to these 
institutions there are eighteen apprenticeship and training centers with varying levels of capacity, which tend to 
focus on shorter term training.  
 

9. Although TVET and skills development efforts are a critical pathway for improving the stock of skilled 
workers for market relevant jobs, the subsector has suffered from numerous challenges which undermine their 
potential. These include the following:    

 

(a) Unsustainable Funding.   Public technical and vocational training institutes receive funding from 
multiple resources, including a payroll tax on private businesses and a tax on foreign workers, but little 
coordination exists among these groups, and allocations do not rely on formal criteria related to needs or 
priorities. In many cases equipment, basic inputs such as electricity, raw materials, and ventilation are 
outdated or non-existent within centers. Further, centers lack autonomy, have no way to generate 
additional revenue, and lack basic governing procedures at the institutional level.  
(b) Low enrollment. TVET centers have extremely low absorptive capacity despite demand and do 
not make use of efficiency measures in scheduling and shifting to maximize space and enrollment. In the 
school year 2014 - 157,042 students were enrolled in technical colleges, and 1,039 in vocational schools. 
The majority of students (5,563 students or 78.3 percent) chose the technical commercial schools while 
the remaining 21.7 percent enrolled in the technical and industrial streams. Private institutions account 
for 27 percent of total enrollment. 
(c) Lack of diversity and access. Access is particularly limited for Chadians living in rural areas, as well 
as women both in rural and urban areas. Furthermore, inclusion measures for participants with 
disabilities, even very basic ones, do not exist within the centers. Just 1.5 percent of enrollment at the 
secondary level is occupied by rural Chadians, given that the centers are concentrated in major cities and 
there are few offerings focused on key sectors such as agriculture,4 and the female imbalance is acute 

                                                           
3 Agriculture Sector Review Report (ASRR) 2017.  
4 N’Djamena is home to 37 percent of the TVET institutions and 48 percent of the sector’s students. In Moundou, the country’s 
second largest city, these numbers stand at 9 percent and 18 percent respectively.

(except for the commercial streams5. Girls accounted for only 5 percent of the total 2,518 enrollees in the 
industrial streams of the TVET institutions and there are extremely small numbers of female teachers and 
no female directors in any of the TVET institutions.6  
(d) Limited relevance and low quality. The key factors driving low quality are (i) program offerings 
do not appear to be driven by employment offerings and do not result in required skills for employment7; 
(ii) equipment is outdated or nonexistent, and hands-on application is often not possible; and (iii) poorly 
trained trainers and staff as well as outdated heavily theoretical curricula diminish the quality of training 
to students.   
(e) Lack of industry involvement. AFD is supporting development of standards which were previously 
non-existent or defunct, however there remains very little input from industry on training design. Further, 
for entrepreneurship and self-employment, even though these remain the main sources of employment. 

 

Institutional Context and Government Strategy  

 

10. The technical and vocational training sector is highly fragmented in terms of both service delivery and 
financing. At least seven ministries intervene in one way or another in the training sector. The three main 
ministries are (i) the Ministry of Vocational Training and Micro Commerce (Ministère de la Formation 
Professionnelle et des Petits Métiers, MFPPM); (ii) the Ministry of National Education and Civics Promotion 
(Ministère de l’Education Nationale et de la Promotion Civique, MENPC); and (iii) the Ministry of Higher Education, 
Research and Innovation (Ministère de l’Enseignement Supérieur, de la Recherche et de l’Innovation, MESRI). Each 
of these ministries manages training centers or schools which deliver diplomas or certificates to its graduates. 
However, many other ministries also manage training schools and centers in their specific sector without any 
relationship to the three major ministries. The Ministry of Civil Service, Labor, and Social Dialogue manages eight 
training centers and the Ministry of Agriculture has 35 centers. The Ministries of Health, Justice, Livestock, Post 
and Telecommunications, and Youth to name a few all manage technical and vocational centers.   
 

11. The National Development Plan (2017-2021), aims at developing Chad into an emerging regional 
country by 2030. It champions the four strategic objectives of (i) strengthening of national unity; (ii) strengthening 
good governance and the rule of law; (iii) the development of a diversified and competitive economy; and (iv) 
improving the quality of life of the Chadian population. As part of this approach, there is an emphasis on improved 
human capacity development and specifically improvement of technical and vocational education through 
Outcome 4.2.2 which stipulates that the actions planned to improve the sector are: (i) building the human and 
material capacities of institutes of technical education; (ii) improving governance of the sector; (iii) improving 
access to, and the fairness and quality of, technical training centers; and (iv) vocational training centers; and (v) 
building the capacities of human resources.  

 

12. President Idriss Deby, reiterated the importance of education and youth employment, following the 
new constitution, in a speech in May 2018, in which he presented the country’s commitment to human capital 
development. This includes significant education reforms which aim to connect education to the world of work, 

                                                           
5 Technical commercial streams graduate students in fields such as management, commerce, or business. 
6 According to 2017-18 institutional annual reports there was one female out of 26 teachers (or 3.8 percent) and 10 females out 

of 70 teachers (or 14.3 percent) in the TVET school of Moundou (CETIM) and N’Djamena (LETIN) respectively 

7 Opportunities in areas such as agriculture, forestry, and fishing, even though they are the main sub-sectors of employment are 
rarely offered.

ensure that skills development of young people is responsive to the most pressing needs of the country especially 
in the critical sector of agriculture, and ensuring more and better job opportunities for young women and men.  

 

13. The specific policy objectives for Technical and Vocational training are further outlined in the 2017 
National Employment and Training Policy, and the 2014 Interim Strategy for TVET which is not yet validated. 
These strategic documents main objectives are to equip young and adult Chadians with the necessary skills to find 
decent jobs or create their own jobs in the growth sectors. To that end, the Government is cognizant of the 
necessity to reform the technical and vocational training sectors by improving its quality and creating stronger 
links with the private sector. The system will also need to improve its absorptive capacity to be able to train even 
a small share of the massive number of youths that will enter the labor market during the next decade, estimated 
at 2.5 million. Without comprehensive and profound reforms, the sector is very unlikely to be able to deliver the 
expected results.

D. Project Description  

 
14. To improve skills, employability, employment prospects, and labor market outcomes for its youth Chad 
will need to adopt a multi-pronged strategy: (i) improve the quality of its general education especially the pre-
primary and primary cycles (PARSET2 is focused on primary education); (ii) improve the quality and relevance of 
its formal technical and professional skills formation system which will lead to higher quantity and better 
employability; and (iii) support the skills acquisition system for those in the informal sector or out-of-school. The 
project is designed to support these through four components. Component 1 will support the expansion of 
quality training opportunities by strengthening the public sector system, while Component 2 aims at improving 
the school to work transition for those in secondary technical or post-secondary education and bringing training 
opportunities to out-of-school youth and those living in rural areas. The main objective of Component 3 is to

Apr 12, 2019 Page 8 of 23  

 

strengthen the governance of the TVET public system which will have medium to long term impacts on the 
system’s ability to deliver quality training and make quality improvements implemented by the project self-
sustaining. Lastly, component 4 will focus on the project management and instilling a culture of monitoring and 
evaluation.  

 

Component 1. Expanding Access to Skills through Improved Technical and Vocational Education 

(US$14.7 million) 

 

15. This component aims to improve access to training and improve the overall quality of vocational 
training to meet the needs of the of the Chadian economy in sectors with high labor potential. This objective 
will be achieved through two sub-components: i) creation of a new model Centre de Formation Technique et 
Professionnelle (Center of Technical and Professional Training -CFTP), including the construction of the CFTP and 
the development of new management and training methods; and (ii) the improvement of the quality and 
upgrading of existing technical and vocational secondary schools in the industrial stream (Collèges and Lycèes 
d’Enseignement Technique et Industriel, CETIN and LETIN). Youth aged 14-29 will be targeted who meet the 
qualifications for entry into the newly created and restructured institutions and will benefit at least 30 percent 
females.  
 

16. Component 1 will roll out a new institutional management and operations model which utilizes industry 
linkages and reorientation of the programs around labor insertion for graduates. This includes adopting sector 
specific curricula currently under development with support from AFD and in-depth training of school managers 
and trainers to upgrade quality of teaching and institutional management. To this end multi-year performance-
based contracts (PBCs) will be signed between the government and targeted institutions which incentivize 
improved relevance, quality, access, and employment outcomes. Greater autonomy of training institutions and 
several sector reforms are required to create an enabling environment for this results-based management and 
operations model, which will be supported under Component 3.  

 

Sub-component 1.1 Improving Access to Quality Skills through the Creation of a new CFTP and 

Expanded Opportunities through preexisting CFTPs (US$5.3 million) 

 

17. The construction of a new CFTP will be funded by the project. The new institution will incorporate the 
new pedagogical and management models including participation from the private sector. The site for the center 
will be X.  
 

18. The project will finance development of the PBC between the CFTP and Ministry which elaborate clear 
targets namely: (i) the establishment of a Board of Directors; (ii) a minimum private sector and civil society 
participation of 40 percent in the Board of Directors; (iii) number young people registered by specialty area; (iv) 
the share of girls enrolled; (v) the share of enrollees participating in dual-training programs; (vi) number of 
graduates certified ; (vii) monitoring of graduates’ insertion in the labor market; (viii) effective in-service training 
of trainers; and (ix) the implementation of a new financing model. The performance contracts will be monitored 
by the MFPPM and each CFTP through their own monitoring and evaluation systems. They will also be supported 
by PARSET2 monitoring and evaluation specialist.

19. Main activities: this sub-component will finance the construction of a new CFTP and the following 
activities through the PBCs: (i) the development and implementation of new pedagogical models and curricula; 
(ii) new administrative management involving the private sector; (iii) strengthening of the professional and 
teaching competencies of trainers; (iv) the provision of relevant equipment; (v) the purchasing of adapted 
textbooks; (vi) rehabilitation of existing infrastructures and equipment; (vii) information and sensitization 
campaigns to attract more female students; and (viii) governance reform and institutional financing. 

 

Sub-component 1.2 Rehabilitation and upgrading of Lycees Techniques et Industriels (US$9.4 million) 

 

20. The project will support the reform and upgrading (modernization) of two to four collèges and lycées 
techniques et industriels through performance-based contracts to improve the quality of service delivery and 
the efficiency and effectiveness of the LETINs. These institutions currently offer courses in construction, 
electricity, and automotive, among others. The institutions are characterized by outdated equipment, limited 
hands-on and relevant training, heavily theory based teaching, and weak links with the private sector. The aim is 
to focus the course offerings, improve the management of the schools, strengthen practicum-based teaching and 
learning, introduce entrepreneurship and non-cognitive (socio-emotional) skills development8, and improve 
linkages with related industry to better prepare graduates for employability, in addition to upgrading of hardware. 

 

21. The project will provide support for the preparation of operational manuals regarding the management 
of TVET schools, performance monitoring, relationship with the private sector relations and the preparation of 
regulatory texts. Technical assistance will be recruited to support the teams responsible for the management of 
TVET schools and the ministerial directorates in charge of technical education and vocational training.  

 

22. Technical auditors will be recruited to conduct an external evaluation of each performance contract and 
certify the level of achievement of the expected results. The technical audit report will be used to determine the 
amount of funds to be allocated for the following year. 

 

23. Main activities: this sub-component will finance the following activities through the PBCs: (i) the 
development and implementation of new pedagogical models and curricula (in coordination with AFD programs); 
(ii) new administrative management involving the private sector; (iii) strengthening of the professional and 
teaching competencies of trainers; (iv) the provision of relevant equipment including for ICT; (v) the purchasing of 
adapted textbooks; (vi) rehabilitation of existing infrastructures and equipment; (vii) information and sensitization 
campaigns to attract more female students; (viii) governance reform and institutional financing; and (ix) study 
tours for all relevant actors especially at the central level, directors, and a select number of teachers. The sub-
component will also finance technical assistance to the TVET school to help them navigate through the 
institutional changes envisioned in the project and improve their financial management capacity. 

 

Component 2. Employment Support for Youth and Improved Entrepreneurship Opportunities (US$24.4 

million)

24. This component seeks to provide first work experiences, and skills relevant to labor market demands, 
including entrepreneurship training, to youth. Targeted young people may have completed the full education 
cycle or dropped out of the school system prior to completion. The objective is to provide quality hands-on job 
training and entrepreneurship training, to improve employability, employment prospects, and ultimately 
livelihoods. This would include (a) internships for skilled graduates in their prospective professions; (b) 
apprenticeships; and (c) entrepreneurship for agricultural development. Apprenticeships and entrepreneurship 
approaches focus heavily on unskilled workers given that they are the most promising approaches to helping the 
large scale of low-skilled individuals within Chad transition into employment/self-employment.

Sub-component 2.1 Internships to Improve School-to-Work Transition (US$6.8 million) 

 

25. The internship program aims to improve the employment outcomes of graduates transitioning from 
secondary or post-secondary general education and TVET institutions into the labor market. Chad’s educational 
system does not have sufficiently strong linkages with the private sector to facilitate the immersion of young 
graduates in enterprises during their time at school or following their graduation. The subcomponent aims to 
address this practical skills gap of current graduates, while simultaneously reorienting the TVET institutional 
approach to focus on employment.  

 

26. Internships will last 6 months during which the internships are funded fully by the project. After the first 
6 months, the contract will be renewable for another 6 months, at which point the intern would be partially funded 
(50 percent) by the enterprise. Internships could for example include placements in hotels, healthcare, other 
service sectors, and construction firms which have been shown through data from ONAPE to recruit the highest 
numbers of workers. After one year, the intern then becomes eligible for recruitment, at which point the company 
would be wholly responsible for funding. The number of interns a company can hire over the course of the project 
and at any point in time will be limited (with optimal limit to be determined) to avoid abuse of the system by 
companies, as well as limits on the number of trainees a company can take without hiring any. The monthly

internship stipend amount will not exceed 60,000 XOF with girls receiving a higher stipend to cover for potential 
day care cost. 

 

27. Main activities: The sub-component will finance (i) employment and internships recruiting camps in 
technical schools, training centers, and universities jointly hosted by ONAPE and the private sector, (ii) 
communications campaigns and partnership building in private companies; (iii) internship payments that include 
stipends, accident and medical insurance coverage, and (iv) technical assistance to ONAPE to implement the 
program and setup a website and the support to its decentralized branches outside of the capital city. 

 

Sub-component 2.2 Expanding Opportunities for Apprenticeships (US$9.2 million).  

 

28. An apprenticeship scheme will be developed to facilitate improved labor market integration for youth 
through a dual apprenticeship program which combines adapted training programs with on-the job training 
opportunities with craftspeople and professionals. Dual training refers to a combination of practical, on the job 
training, and theoretical education to ensure an optimal blend of theory and practice. Training programs will 
combine practical training and theory with an emphasis on hands-on experiences in various types of workshops. 
Training in training institutions will constitute 25 percent of the program, with 75 percent focused on hands-on 
practical application, and will be targeting to youth with a minimum level of education. Additionally, training in 
functional literacy, numeracy and life skills will be coupled with the job specific training to improve employability. 
 
29. To encourage female participation the project will pay a higher stipend to girls especially those with 
children who need to pay for day care costs. The payment of the stipend will depend on attendance. The project 
will also encourage girls to join male-dominated trades which provide better employment prospects and higher 
earnings in the labor market through a targeted sensitization campaign. 

 

30. Main Activities: the sub-component will finance (i) training fees for the training providers and master 
craftsmen; (ii) stipends for the trainees paid via mobile money; (iii) training in functional literacy and numeracy 
and life skills by qualified training providers; (iv) a defined package of materials and equipment including all 
necessary protections, (v) accident and medical insurance coverage for apprentices; (vi) costs associated with 
training of trainers, upgrading of skills of apprentice instructors, (vii) costs associated with selection and placement 
of apprentices; (viii) development of new training guidelines and the design and implementation of the regulatory 
and operational framework for the apprenticeship program; and (ix) an institutional and organizational audit of 
FONAP as well as monitoring and evaluation. 

 

Sub-component 2.3 Development of Agricultural Entrepreneurship (US$9.0 million) 

 

31. The sub-component will aim to provide entrepreneurship training to youth in rural communities to 
improve livelihoods. The goal is to provide necessary skills for addressing constraints related to (i) lack of 
entrepreneurship know-how (equipping small scale farmers with knowledge to diversify options and ideally 
transition out of subsistence farming); ii) community organizing along agro-value chains (i.e. building the value 
chain so that it is possible to grow, harvest, transform products, and get them to markets) and (iii) limited means

CHAD Skills Development for Youth Employment and Competitiveness Project (P164297)

of food processing (i.e. loss of mangos during mango season due to limited technical skills and small scale 
equipment which result in not being able to transform/conserve them).  The approach is consistent with the large 
numbers of youth who remain in rural communities in Chad, and the majority of workers who are engaged in 
informal employment in the agriculture sector.  

 

32. Linkages between producers and sources of financing will be critically important and will be facilitated 
by connecting promising small-scale agriculture entrepreneurs with micro-loans via ONAPE. ONAPE has prior 
experience providing micro-lending to agriculture entrepreneurs, thus the program will build on the current 
mechanism, improve capacity and scale the approach. 

 

33. Main Activities: The sub-component will finance (i) a campaign to promote training activities and 
agriculture as a viable livelihood; (ii) the development of the training modules; (iii) delivery of training sessions via 
contracted local NGOs; (iv) training of trainers; (v) agriculture micro-loans through the existing ONAPE financing 
mechanism; and (vi) monitoring and evaluation. 

 

Component 3. Improving TVET System Governance and Institutional Capacity Building (US$5.9 million) 

 

34. This component is designed to strengthen the TVET system which suffers from weak governance and 
chronic underfunding.  Given the relative neglect of the sub-sector, the sustainability of the project depends on 
the capacity of the collèges, lycées, and CFPT to self-finance their activities.  It is critical that the status of these 
schools is revised to provide them with more autonomy and allow them to generate revenue, and flexibility to 
spend it.  Thus, a new regulatory framework will be necessary as is improved institutional and management 
capacities of the ministries and institutions involved in project implementation and project execution.  
 

35. This component will also build the leadership and management capacity of CFTP and TVET school 
directors to improve service delivery and implement a new finance model. TVET schools have often very low 
teacher-student ratios and teachers are underutilized - working less than 12 hours per week on average. Re-
organizing school calendars, better planning the use of classrooms and workshops, and organizing dual-training 
could substantially increase the number of students the institutions receive without jeopardizing its quality. To 
provide more training opportunities to the youth restructuring the current  financing model which currently 
operates using several uncoordinated sources of funding is critical. Rethinking the highly fragmented nature the 
training fund and address the financing challenges and the fractured nature of the skills development sector in 
Chad in terms of both service delivery and financing is also necessary.  

 

36. Because the reforms envisioned in this component are necessary for the public sector TVET to perform, 
their effective implementation will condition disbursement for the activities in Component 1. As noted earlier, 
if the CETIN, LETIN, and CFTP continue to operate under the current model i.e. with no public financing, no 
possibility to generate own funds, no cooperation with the private sector, and an outdated governance structure 
with little accountability it is very unlikely that any investment in this system will be sustainable. New equipment 
will become old and rusty because of lack of maintenance funds, teachers will quickly revert to theory-only 
teaching because they would lack the necessary material for labs.

37. Main Activities: this component will finance (i) TA to revisit the TVET national strategy and the national 
employment policy; (ii) roundtable and national consultations around the revised strategy; (iii) training of CFTP 
and TVET institutions’ staff; (iv) capacity building activities of selected training institutions, government 
departments, private sector associations, and employment agencies; (v) south-south exchanges through study 
tours; (vi) the revision of the national strategy of technical and vocational education and training, (vii) revision of 
the national employment policy; (viii) ONAPE’s capacity building to manage a website and generate databases to 
match supply and demand sides; (ix) national awareness campaigns that promote TVET and especially girls in 
TVET; (x) a study on the supply of training in Chad; and (xi) organizational and institutional audits of ONAPE, 
FONAP, and other important institutions. 

 

Component 4. Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation (US$5.0 million) 

 

38. This component will support the Project Coordination Unit (PCU), M&E activities, and capacity building 
activities associated with the implementation of the project. PARSET2’s PCU which has successfully managed 
several projects is retained to manage the project. The PCU will be responsible for overall coordination and 
implementation of project activities, as well as financial management (FM) and procurement. The project would 
finance the salaries of PCU staff, operational costs and the cost of equipment. Additionally, this component would 
cover specific technical assistance (TA) and capacity building needs for project implementation, and M&E 
(including third party validation, surveys, and impact evaluations). The proposed capacity building activities under 
this component could include: (i) trainings, study tours, and other initiatives to enhance the capacity of relevant 
ministry or agency staff to implement, coordinate, and monitor their programs; and (ii) capacity building of TVET 
institution administrators to increase their capacity to design surveys, conduct tracer studies and utilize the data 
for analysis and action.  

 

39. Assessment activities – including, impact evaluations and beneficiary surveys of interventions under 
component 2, as well as support to the Gender Innovation Lab which will work with local institutions to carry out 
statistical analysis/employment surveys/labor studies/etc. monitoring of youth and follow-up activities during 
internships, survey of youth after the completion of the internships, apprenticeships, and entrepreneurships. 
There will also be at least two impact evaluations embedded in the project. This includes working with the Gender 
Innovation Lab to evaluate the impact of the inclusion of socio-emotional in the skills training program on labor 
market outcomes such as likelihood of wage employment, self-employment, or net income. There will be a special 
focus on rural areas and girls.

E. Implementation 
 

Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 
 
40. The project will be implemented over a five-year period. The proposed closing date is October 31, 2024. 
The Ministry of National Education and the Promotion of Civics (Ministère de l’Education Nationale et de la 
Promotion Civique, MENPC) and the Ministry of Vocational Training and Micro Works (Ministère de la Formation 
Professionnelle et des Petits Métiers, MFPPM) will be the main implementing agencies for the project. 
 
41. Steering Committee (SC). A system-wide Steering Committee (SC) will be established to provide 
guidance to the project on an annual basis. The representative of the MFPPM will be the President of the SC and 
the representative of the MENPC will assume the Vice-Presidency. The SC will have representatives of MEPD, the 
Ministry of Higher Education, Research, and Innovation (Ministère de l’Enseignement Supérieur, de la Recherche 
et de l’Innovation, MESRI), the Ministry of Finance and Budget (Ministère des Finances et du Budget, MFB), the 
Ministry of Civil Service, Work, and Social Dialogue (Ministère de la Fonction Publique, du Travail et du Dialogue 
Social, MFPTDS), the Ministry of Youth Promotion, Sports, and Employment (Ministère de la Promotion des 
Jeunes, des Sports, et de l’Emploi, MPJSE), the Ministry of Production, Irrigation, and Agricultural Equipment 
(Ministère de la Production, de l’Irrigation et des Equipements Agricoles, MPIEA). It should also include 
representatives of civil society and private sector. 

 

42. At the annual meeting, the MENPC and MFPPM with support from the PCU will provide results for the 
year and will set out its intended results and necessary resources for the following year. The annual meeting 
will be done before the end of September of each year to ensure that the decisions taken by the Steering 
Committee are reflected in the budget submission for the following year. The first meeting of the Steering 
Committee is expected to take place in November 2019 (the second in September 2020) while the first annual 
work plan will be devised by the preparation team with the support of PARSET2. 

 

43. The PCU will be responsible for daily project coordination, as well as the administration of the financing: 
procurement, financial management, disbursement, monitoring, reporting and evaluation, environmental and 
social safeguards. The PCU is already staffed with a qualified Project Coordinator, Procurement Specialist, 
Financial Management Specialist, Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Specialist, and Accountant. PARSET will be 
required to hire a team of engineers who will help oversee the CFTP construction and the rehabilitation program 
of the lycées and collèges d’enseignement technique et industriel. In addition, the DPEF will add a full-time 
Safeguards Specialist to ensure that the environmental and social safeguards requirements are met. Technical 
implementation of the Project will be the responsibility of each concerned department within the MENPC, 



 

The World Bank  
CHAD Skills Development for Youth Employment and Competitiveness Project (P164297) 

 

 

  
Apr 12, 2019 Page 15 of 23  

 

MFPPM, MFPTDS, and MEPD. Detailed project implementation mechanisms will be provided in the Project 
Implementation Manual (PIM), which will be completed by effectiveness. 

 

44. The role of the Steering Committee is to provide guidance and advice for strategic direction of the 
project and approve annual budget and action plan. In those cases where specific action is needed to address 
issues that go beyond the scope of any single ministry, the president of the Steering Committee can bring together 
the relevant parties to find solutions to problems that are inter-ministerial in nature, which may be presented to 
the Steering Committee, if necessary. 

 

45. The following implementation arrangements will be established. No more than three months after 
project effectiveness, each relevant MENPC and MFPPM director will nominate focal points who will be heads of 
components and sub-components who will work with the PARSET2 coordinator and the M&E specialist to convene 
the appropriate Government officials to finalize the work plan for each component. These will be key contributions 
to the overall project work plan to be developed by the project coordinator under the guidance of the Steering 
Committee which will be discussed with MENPC and MFPPM and communicated to the Bank. Thereafter, once a 
quarter, the PCU will report on progress to the MENPC and MFPPM as well as key development partners within 
the LEG and will share the work plan for the following three months. 

 

46. Annual reviews will be held in November/December of each year, bringing together all key stakeholders 
in the system. At those reviews, the MENPC and MFPPM officials will provide updates on the status of the technical 
and vocational education and training sector, including information regarding the start of the school year 
(enrollments, recruitments, trainings, and so on). Each functional/central directorate will present its results, and 
each regional directorate will do the same. The arrangements will be formalized in the project implementation 
manual. More details on the project implementation arrangements can be found in Annex 1.

SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

Due to the civil works inherent to constructions 
and/or rehabilitation civil works activities of 
schools/centers, the potential social and 
environmental risks of the proposed project are 
expected to be moderate and mostly site-specific, 
with no significant or long-term negative risks and 
impacts, which are foreseen to be easily 
manageable; typical of category B projects. 
  
Since project’s physical footprint is presently 
unknown and would so be prior to appraisal, in 
compliance with OP/BP 4.01 (Environmental 
Assessment) core requirements, the Borrower will 
prepare, consult upon and publicly disclose – both 
in-country and on the world Bank’s website, prior to 
appraisal, an environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF) to guide the way that potential 
negative environmental and social risks and impacts 
of future sub-projects will be identified and 
mitigated during project implementation.  If, during 
project preparation/implementation, any project 
specific site is known before appraisal, a site-specific 
an Environmental and Social Impact Assessments 
(ESIA)/Environmental and Social Management Plans 
(ESMP) will also be prepared, amply consulted upon 
and publicly disclosed, both in-country and on the 
World Bank website prior to appraisal the physical 
start of civil works  

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No  

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No  

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No  

Pest Management OP 4.09 No 

The project comprises no activity which may induce 
the purchase and/or the use of pesticides or related 
chemicals. The project will not finance pesticides 
acquisition or distribution. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

This policy is triggered because of the nature of 
possible civil works to be financed under component 
1 – more precisely under sub-component 1.2 which 
might lead to the unearthing of such potential 
physical cultural resources (PCR).  Nevertheless, it is 



 

The World Bank  
CHAD Skills Development for Youth Employment and Competitiveness Project (P164297) 

 

 

  
Apr 12, 2019 Page 17 of 23  

 

highly unlikely that any physical cultural resources 
will be impacted; nonetheless, the existing a  
“Chance finds procedures” will be embedded in the 
ESMF to ensure that these aspects will be taken into 
account an adequate management of PSRs during 
project preparation and implementation. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
The policy is not triggered as there are no 
Indigenous People in project targeted areas. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The project has triggered OP/BP 4.12 (Involuntary 
Resettlement) to enable the project to better tackle 
issues related to land acquisition, including 
economic and physical displacement. Since the 
project footprint is yet to be known, the Borrower 
will prepare project has updated the a Resettlement 
Policy Framework  (RPF) for each participating 
country. The RPF sets out the policies, principles, 
institutional arrangements, likely categories of 
affected people, eligibility criteria and categories, 
compensation rates, methods of valuing affected 
assets, community participation and information 
dissemination, Grievance Redress Mechanism and 
effective monitoring and evaluation. The RPF will be 
amply consulted upon, and once cleared by the Bank 
it will be publicly disclosed both in-country and at 
the WB’s external website prior to appraisal.  
 
 Further, when investment sites lead to land take 
that causes economic and/or physical displacement, 
the borrower will prepare a site-specific 
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). Since the 
resettlement process is meant to be inclusive to 
encompass vulnerable social groups and guarantee 
that they receive fair and equitable treatment, the 
corresponding site-specific RAPs, wherever deemed 
necessary, will be consulted upon, cleared by the 
World Bank, and publicly disclosed both in-country 
and at the external WB’s website prior to the 
physical start of civil works  

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 
The project will not finance any activities related to 
the construction of dams nor affect operations of 
existing dams or affiliated reservoirs 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No The project will not affect international waterways. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No No activities are planned in any disputed areas.

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The project is focused on improving skills of the Chadian youth, with an emphasis on improving the public TVET 
system, instituting performance-based contracts, building capacity, improving the governance of TVET institutions, 
creating linkages with the private sector, improving monitoring and evaluation, etc. As such, these activities have little 
to no environmental impact. However, civil works will also be financed, such as the construction of technical and 
vocational training centers, and the extension and rehabilitation of secondary technical schools, within existing 
schools, the provision of fencing, access to clean water, adequate sanitation, and electricity for which the most cost-
effective and environment-friendly options (such as solar panels) will be given preference. Impacts from these 
activities could include work-related health and safety impacts; noise, dust, reduction of air and water quality; loss of 
tree/vegetation cover; etc. The short, medium- and long-term socio-economic impact of the proposed project is 
expected to be largely beneficial. The project has a low probability of inducing physical or economic displacement. Its 
intervention is mainly focused on existing secondary schools and vocational training centers except for the 
construction of one new model center. As there may be some unforeseen resettlement. Therefore, the project will 
prepare a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). The influx of male workers may increase the demand for sex. As a 
result, women in the project community may be subject to higher rates of violence. 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
Not applicable 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
Not applicable 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
As the impacts from Project activities on the environment are expected to be moderate, the Borrower will prepare an 
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF). The ESMF will be used by the implementing agency as a 
defined procedure and guidelines to screen each activity as it is proposed for financing. The ESMF will be used to 
prepare site-specific Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) which will include impacts, mitigation 
measures, a responsible entity and a budget for each mitigation activity. Given the Recipient’s limited but growing 
experience with implementation of environmental and social safeguards instruments, close safeguards supervision 
and implementation support will be carried out during the early stage of project implementation until adequate 
safeguards experience is developed. The PARSET2 engineer, in collaboration with the relevant directorate and regional 
office of the MFPPM, will supervise the implementation of the safeguards instruments discussed above. IDA 
supervision will focus on: (i) providing regular implementation support; (ii) carrying out field reviews of safeguards 
implementation; and (iii) monitoring safeguards implementation based on periodic progress reports.  
 
The short, medium- and long-term socio-economic impact of the proposed project is expected to be largely beneficial. 
The project has a low probability of inducing physical or economic displacement. Its intervention is mainly focused on 
existing technical secondary schools and vocational training centers. However, the construction of a new vocational

training center is planned in Sahr region. As there may be some unforeseen resettlement. Therefore, the project will 
prepare a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). The construction to be realized in this project are not large and the 
works will be realized by the local companies. Thus, the influx of foreign labor will be very limited, or-existent. 
Nevertheless, the project will also set in place mechanisms to prevent Sexual Exploitation and Abuse and sexual based 
violence. The project will emphasize the importance of having internal prevention and response systems and policies 
(sexual harassment policies, anonymous reporting mechanisms) in place and building staff capacity to recognize and 
address these issues at the project level during implementation. Finally, a The GRM will be prepared, in consultation 
with stakeholders, including communities. A project level GRM is outlined in the RPF and ESMF. It is designed to be a 
mechanism that is trusted by all relevant partners including the project affected persons (PAPs), if it turns out that 
impacts happened in the implementation stage. It will facilitate the redress of any grievance and conflict that may 
arise from the Project. The PIU will be notified of any disputes in the project zone. Project field staff should work 
closely with the communities and the community leaders to clarify and resolve any misunderstanding that could give 
rise to conflicts. The PIU will develop a clear plan and procedures for the GRM, including complaint collection and 
processing procedures, reporting format, database/records specifications, and committee membership using 
guidelines provided in the RPF and ESMF. Public participation and consultation will be a key part of the process at all 
times to promote understanding and prevent unnecessary complaints and disputes.  
 
IDA supervision will be carried out by field-based Bank technical staff, complemented by specialist consultants as 
necessary, during regular biannual supervision missions and during interim technical safeguards missions that will 
respond to emerging issues. Monitoring will be based on ESMF activities. It will also be an occasion to discuss the 
project safeguard requirements with the Recipient, including management plan and reporting requirements. 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
During the preparation of the ESMF and RPF, the Borrower held consultation with several public TVET institutions and 
communities located in the regions that will be targeted by the project such as Moyen-Chari, Sahr, and Moundou as 
well as in N'Djamena. The Borrower met with TVET schools directors, teachers, and students. Further consultations 
will be held before appraisal and will specifically ensure that vulnerable groups, like women, refugees, etc. are 
included

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 
Southern Africa’s increasingly integrated regional market presents opportunities for greater economic growth and 
poverty reduction. Southern Africa is a diverse region of both low income and middle-income countries and is home to 
over 330 million people connected through an increasingly dynamic regional market. The region hosts two well-
established pan-African institutions covering agriculture and commerce—the Southern African Development Community 
(SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), which are actively pursuing a regional 
integration agenda. 
 
Agriculture varies in importance from country to country within the region but is the primary source of subsistence, 
employment, and income for most of the population. Particularly in the lower income countries, agriculture is the 
largest contributor to GDP, and the performance of the agricultural sector has a strong influence on growth, 
employment, food security, and poverty. In Angola, while the agriculture sector contributes only on average 5.5 percent 
to GDP, 44 percent of the employed population works in the sector. More than half of Angola’s poor are in rural areas 
and depend almost exclusively on agriculture for their livelihood.  Within Lesotho, agriculture contributes around 6 per 
cent to the GDP, employs almost 60 per cent of the labor force (on subsistence farms) and provides livelihood 
sustenance for 90 per cent of the rural population.  In Lesotho, more than half the population – 57 percent – live below 
the poverty line, many of whom reliant on agricultural activities. 
 
Both Angola and Lesotho have experienced development challenges common to the Southern Africa region: economies 
heavily reliant on natural resource exports with high levels unemployment and food and nutrition insecurity in rural 
areas. For many countries in Southern Africa over-reliance on oil and mineral resource driven growth has led to 
increased focus on economic diversification and more inclusive growth.  
 
Within Angola the 2015/2016 oil price shock highlighted the need to more forcefully address vulnerabilities and 
dependence on oil, and diversify the economy and better manage oil revenue volatility. The shock prompted the 
Government of Angola to accelerate efforts to diversify the economy and reduce dependence on food imports. The 
Government’s strategy in the face of the crisis placed a strong emphasis on agriculture as an immediate way to increase 
domestic production and reduce imports. Increased agricultural production (particularly cereals and vegetables) and 
productivity have the potential to ease the current account pressures and the foreign exchange scarcity. 
 
Lesotho’s economic growth has been driven by natural resource based exports – water and diamonds –  and is strongly

linked to trade with South Africa, where Lesotho also struggles to compete with South Africa’s more efficient firms or 
farms. Lesotho’s National Strategic Development Plan prioritized development of several sectors – agriculture and rural 
economy, manufacturing, tourism and mining. Measures to develop processing and manufacturing capacity – including 
agro-based – are important to diversification efforts and address rural unemployment.  
 
The region’s rich land and water resources have potential but the agriculture sector has not yet been fully developed to 
contribute to economic transformation. Southern Africa region falls within the so-called Guinea Savannah zone, which 
has significant potential for highly productive commercial agriculture as with similar agro-ecologies in other parts of the 
world such as Brazil and Thailand. Angola is the third largest country in sub–Saharan Africa in terms of geographic size 
and much of its agricultural land is within the underexploited Guinea Savanah zone. A major agricultural producer before 
the civil war, Angola’s agricultural performance remains a fraction of its potential.   
 
In the past 50 years, Lesotho has gone from a position of virtual self-sufficiency in grain production to being highly 
dependent on imports of grain.  A mountainous country with limited amounts of arable land, Lesotho nonetheless has 
areas of high agricultural potential and the possibility to exploit its extensive water resources and unique highland 
growing environment – particularly for higher value crops.  
 
 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
Raising agricultural productivity is necessary if agriculture is to contribute to growth and poverty reduction. Agricultural 
productivity has increased in southern Africa, but remains well below potential. This remains the case in Angola and 
Lesotho where even average yields are below southern Africa regional averages. Most of the growth in productivity in 
Africa has come from bringing previously uncultivated land into production, rather than from intensification made 
possible by technical change. Comparisons of total factor productivity growth have shown technical change accounted 
for a large share of agricultural productivity growth in Asia and Latin America, but a very small share of agricultural 
productivity growth in Africa in recent decades. Southern Africa has experienced more technology-driven productivity 
growth than other regions in Africa, but the gains have occurred mainly in middle income countries. Analysis has 
identified several yield gaps (the difference between actual and potential yields) that could be narrowed with additional 
investments in technology adaptation and dissemination. 
 
Regional approaches to technology generation and dissemination are a more effective and strategic than national 
efforts alone. Regional integration has proven to be an effective strategy that can allow groups of countries facing 
common research challenges to increase the efficiency of their investments in agricultural R&D. Adoption of a regional 
approach to research based on the concentration of resources within a reduced number of large, specialized research 
institutes serving an expansive shared technology space can deliver many benefits. First, it can reduce duplication by 
allowing a single regional research institute to undertake work that otherwise would be done in parallel within multiple 
national research institutes. Second, it can help capture economies of scale by concentrating resources within a single 
institute, where they can achieve a critical mass. Third, it can increase the payoffs to research by facilitating 
dissemination of improved technologies across national borders, thereby vastly increasing the number of beneficiaries. 
Fourth, it can mitigate the isolation that frequently occurs in small, fragmented research institutes by creating effective 
mechanisms for facilitating knowledge exchange and technology transfer. 
 
Southern Africa continues to offer attractive opportunities for regional research. Groups of countries within southern 
Africa share similar agro-ecological zones and farming systems, suggesting that there is potential for finding shared 
solutions to common problems. Technology spillover is already occurring within the sub-region, and several high-

yielding crop varieties and improved crop and livestock management practices have been successfully disseminated 
across borders. Significant unrealized potential remains, however, for expanding spillovers.  Southern Africa is aso 
vulnerable to climate shocks and many countries are likely to face greater variability and more pronounced extremes of 
temperature and rainfall. Adaptation measures—particularly the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices—will 
be needed to maintain productivity and ensure resilience in the face of more frequent and more severe shocks. 
 
National systems for generating and disseminating agricultural technology are operating well below their potential, 
constrained by inadequate facilities, shortages of qualified staff, and low levels of overall investment and budget 
support. These factors, in turn, are linked to the high degree of fragmentation in the deployment of resources within the 
sector, as limited financing is spread over a range of priorities. Given the small size of many countries and economies in 
the sub-region, few can afford fully elaborated technology development systems capable of addressing all of the crops 
and livestock breeds in their highly diversified production systems. This particularly true in the case of Angola and 
Lesotho, which have small number of PhD scientists (particularly for Lesotho) and infrastructure that has largely been 
devastated by the civil war.   
 
The regional productivity program model has demonstrated satisfactory outcomes.  The Agricultural Productivity 
Program for Southern Africa (APPSA) was approved in March 2013 with IDA financing to Malawi, Mozambique and 
Zambia. APPSA is part of the Bank’s larger portfolio of regional agricultural productivity programs and was third regional 
operation in a series that followed the successful implementation of the West Africa Agricultural Productivity Program 
(WAAPP) and the East Africa Agricultural Productivity Program (EAAPP).  Like the first two programs, it was expected 
that APPSA would expand to include additional countries as they expressed interest and if financing was available.  
 
In terms of results, to date APPSA has launched 74 R&D sub-projects which are currently making 156 technologies 
available to farmers (new and “on the shelf” technologies). This includes 47 technologies in Malawi (37 seed varieties; 10 
agronomic practices); 63 technologies in Mozambique (11 seed varieties; 28 agronomic practices, 16 pest and diseases 
management practices, 3 water management practices, and 5 post-harvest technologies); and 46 technologies in Zambia 
(31 seed varieties; 15 agronomic practices). Additional results include improving cross border movement of technology 
through the introduction of new plant material and varieties; scaling up extension and dissemination of improved 
technologies to reach more farmers; improved seed production; building a larger pipeline of qualified agricultural 
scientists – particularly women scientists; and upgrading of laboratory and fields to modern standards. 
 

Relationship to CPF 
 
APPSA is consistent with the emerging priorities of the new Regional Integration Strategy and the Africa Region 
priorities. Africa Region has prioritized IBRD and IDA funding around macroeconomic stability, improving 
competitiveness and economic diversification, improving human capital and access to basic services; and resilience to 
shocks. APPSA touches closely on the latter three areas with a focus on increasing.   
 
The Angola CPF is currently under review, but agriculture remains a high priority and APPSA aligns to Pillar I of the 
outgoing CPF, which is focused on supporting integrated national economic diversification and regionally balanced 
development. Productivity is central with a focus on increasing yields and developing post-harvest processing 
technologies.  APPSA is also consistent with Lesotho’s FY16 – 20 CPF Focus Area II: Promoting Private Sector Jobs 
Creation, which will direct support towards improving smallholder and MSME agriculture productivity. The CPF 
specifically prioritizes raising productivity, strengthening farmers’ capacity, fostering stronger marketing linkage, 
substituting imports from South Africa, create job opportunities, and promote women’s status in rural communities.

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  
 

 
To increase the availability of improved agricultural technologies in participating countries in the Southern Africa 
Development Community (SADC) region. 

 
Key Results (From PCN) 

 
Results would be measured using the APPSA results – which include the following PDO indicators: 
 

• Number of technologies that are being made available to farmers and other end users   
• Percentage of Lead Farmers in targeted areas who are aware of an improved technology promoted by the 

Project  
• Number of technologies generated or promoted by the Project in one participating country that are released 

in another participating country 
• Direct Project beneficiaries (number) 
• of which female (percentage) 

 
D. Concept Description 

 
APPSA’s regional design. APPSA is currently supporting agricultural research, technology dissemination, and capacity 
building activities associated within a regional collaborative framework around priority farming systems/commodities 
value chains.  These have been identified on the basis of a regional priority-setting study that identified leading R&D 
priorities for the SADC region, as well as the priorities indicated by each country. To date APPSA is actively supporting 
research and dissemination activities around maize, sorghum, legumes (beans, soybean, cowpea, pigeon pea), rice, 
cassava, and cross cutting climate smart agriculture practices. Regional Centers of Leadership have been established in 
in legumes (Zambia), maize based farming systems (Malawi) and rice based farming systems (Mozambique).  
 
The proposed expansion would allow the addition of horticulture and roots and tubers (cassava and potato) to APPSA 
activities with Angola taking a lead on cassava and Lesotho taking a lead on horticulture. This adds a valuable dimension 
to APPSA with a stronger focus on higher value production (fruits, vegetables, potatoes) and processing.     
 
Component 1: Technology Generation and Dissemination. The first component will finance technology generation and 
dissemination activities associated with the commodity or commodity groups being targeted by APPSA. Regional R&D 
activities for the initial targeted commodities have been developed in the initial set of APPSA participating countries and 
additional activities proposed by Angola and Lesotho as part of as part of the preparation of each country’s RCoL 
proposal. R&D activities include technology generation (research), but also technology dissemination activities 
(extension, strengthening of innovation systems).  
 
All activities financed under Component 1 are undertaken through collaborative R&D projects involving the participation 
of at least two countries. To date 74 R&D projects have been developed  through the following process: (i) for each 
commodity being targeted by APPSA, priorities are identified and endorsed at national level; (ii) draft concept notes are 
developed through communication with other regional partners; (iii) for each commodity being targeted by APPSA, 
regional planning meetings will be convened by CCARDESA to facilitate the finalization of regional research and 
dissemination priorities and associated R&D project proposals; (iv) a peer review process facilitated by CCARDESA 
provides feedback on the relevance and quality of R&D project proposals; and (v) R&D project proposals will be

Oct 01, 2017 Page 7 of 13  

     

confirmed and agreed at national level.  
 
Participating countries will participate in R&D projects relating to the commodity farming system being targeted by the 
RCoL that they are hosting, as well as in R&D projects relating to the commodity farming systems being targeted by 
RCoLs in other countries; or additional R&D priorities that are agreed collectively by all participating countries. 
Therefore, each country is expected to devote a share of its Component 1 funding to R&D projects related to the 
commodity farming system being targeted by the RCoL that it is hosting, but a portion of its Component 1 funds will also 
go to support R&D projects related to the commodity farming systems being targeted by RCoLs hosted by other 
countries or any other regional priorities.  
 
Technology dissemination priorities: APPSA will support the dissemination of improved technologies by providing 
resources for RCoLs to engage with a range of partners in scaling up the use of promising innovations of relevance to the 
targeted commodities. APPSA will help to strengthen the links between researchers, extension agents, input 
distributors, and farmers and other end users, but lead responsibility for technology dissemination will remain with the 
national extension system.  
 
Component 2: Strengthening the Institutional and Enabling Environment for Technology Adoption. Component 2 will 
support activities to strengthen institutional capacity of RCoLs and to facilitate the movement of improved technology. 
The choice of activities to be financed will be driven primarily by the specific needs of each country, as identified at 
national level. In general APPSA will support: (i) upgrading of research infrastructure including rehabilitation and 
construction of physical infrastructure; farm, laboratory, and office equipment; and information technology and 
knowledge management systems; (ii) upgrading of infrastructure for sanitary and phytoanitary (SPS) management; (iii) 
improving institutional administration and performance management systems within RCoLs or SPS systems; (iv) 
developing human capital including by providing scientific or technical training at the post graduate level; by upgrading 
skills through short courses or targeted training, and scientific exchanges; and (iv) strengthening seed production 
capacity, seed regulatory functions, and related services.   
 
Component 3: Coordination and Facilitation. Component 3 will finance three main categories of activities:  
 
National level research coordination and management: At national level, APPSA will finance project coordination 
activities, including planning and budgeting, management and administration, monitoring and evaluation, safeguards 
compliance, and regional engagement. If necessary, APPSA could finance consultants to ensure that all essential project 
coordination activities are carried out effectively. Government counterpart resources will be used to pay staff-related 
costs not eligible for IDA or IBRD funding.  
 
Regional facilitation by CCARDESA: At the regional level, APPSA will finance regional facilitation activities including: (i) 
planning, monitoring and evaluation activities related to regional collaboration; (ii) regional exchange of information, 
knowledge and technologies; and (iii) technical assistance and capacity building. Many of these activities will be carried 
out by CCARDESA, which will play an important role in facilitating the development of R&D projects, including organizing 
the peer review process and providing quality control. The regional facilitation activities to be performed by CCARDESA 
will be supported using funds from a subsidiary agreement between the APPSA participating countries.  
 
R&D policy analysis and dialogue: APPSA financing will support analytical work, needs assessments, and policy dialogue 
or policy harmonization activities in key areas that affect R&D at national and regional level. Work will focus on analysis 
of relevant policies and legislation for intellectual property rights, operationalization of the SADC harmonized seed 
regulatory system, implementation of biosafety regulations, and similar topics. Discussions will take place during

Oct 01, 2017 Page 8 of 13  

     

implementation to determine whether Project resources could be used productively to advance the regional seed 
agenda. If the participating countries agree that APPSA could play a useful role by supporting key players other than the 
RCoLs, support for these key players could be channeled through CCARDESA. 
 
 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
Project activities will take place on research stations and farmer fields (on farm trials and demonstrations). The activities 

will all take place on land that is already part of existing agricultural research stations in the respective countries. 
However, as not all land is currently in active use by the client and the exact location of all project activities are not 
known, OP4.12 has been triggered as a precautionary measure.  
 
Indigenous Peoples (IPs) in Angola are dispersed through small communities in southern Angola border regions and their 

exact location is difficult to identify. Therefore, once potential project locations are confirmed, OP4.10 may be triggered 
to provide clear guidance if IP groups are encountered during the course of implementation. 
 

 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
Both Angola and Lesotho have some experience in implementing Bank safeguards requirements through other projects 

but capacities remain limited in the specific implementing agencies. In Angola the implementing agency is the Ministry of 
Agriculture through its Institute of Agriculture (Institute de Investigacão Agricola (IIA)). In Lesotho the implementing 
agency is the Ministry of Agriculture through its Department for Agricultural Research (DAR). In each agency, incremental 
staff and consultants will be recruited to ensure implementation of safeguards instruments and monitoring compliance of 
all components. In addition, the World Bank will provide guidance and training to ensure that the client will have the 
adequate capacity to implement, monitor and report on environmental and social issues. Both Angola and Lesotho, have 
established project implementation units for other World Bank agriculture projects that will be utilized for shared 
services, and fiduciary and safeguards issues.

Oct 01, 2017 Page 9 of 13  

     

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The policy is triggered as a result of: (i) proposed 
research activities under component 1 which could 
include breeding, germplasm, and on farm technology 
testing that can involve the application of agro-
chemicals including chemical pesticides; and (ii) 
capacity building for Regional Centers of Leadership 
under component 2, which would include financing for 
civil works investment in field rehabilitation, office and 
lab infrastructure and irrigation related upgrading or 
construction. Angola and Lesotho will prepare an 
Environment and Social Management Framework 
(ESMF) as the safeguard instruments which will 
provide mitigation measures and a uniform approach 
for addressing identified potential negative 
environmental impacts as well as screening 
procedures and monitoring plans for compliance 
management.  
 
The project is proposed to be classified as an EA 
category B. 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No  

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No 

The policy is not triggered as the program would not 
involve significant conversion of natural habitats 
through its direct or indirect activities. APPSA support 
under component 1 activities are intended to improve 
the productivity of agriculture through the adoption of 
improved technologies (intensification) rather than 
expansion of agricultural production (extensification). 
Technologies developed, tested and released under 
the project would not specifically target natural 
habitats but would aim to improve the productivity of 
existing agricultural practices. Under Component 2 the 
project is expected to finance infrastructure upgrading 
on already existing agricultural research stations and 
fields. No new land would be acquired and natural 
habitats are not known to be inside or adjacent to 
research stations. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 

The policy is not triggered as program activities do not 
have any direct impacts on the health and quality of 
forests, people who depend on forests, nor is there an 
aim to change the management, protection, or 
utilization of forests.  

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 
The program may purchase pesticides or 
agrochemicals at very low volumes as part of project 
supported research activities. No pesticides or 



 
The World Bank  
Agricultural Productivity Program for Southern Africa - Angola & Lesotho (P164486) 

 
 

  
Oct 01, 2017 Page 10 of 13  

     

agrochemicals will be purchased and supplied to 
farmers outside of their participation in research trials 
or demonstrations activities.  Adoption of improved 
agricultural technology generated by APPSA could 
indirectly result in increased use of pesticides and 
agrochemicals by farmers, but the scale of this indirect 
impact is not known. For this reason, each 
participating country will prepare a Pest Management 
Plan (PMP) which incorporates Integrated Pest 
Management (IPM) procedures. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

The policy is not triggered as implementation is not 
expected to involve any known physical cultural 
resources and will take place on land already actively 
in use for agricultural purposes either within 
agricultural research stations or farmer fields. 
Nonetheless, lessons learned from other projects in 
Lesotho have shown that in some of the districts 
where the project will be implemented, such as Leribe 
and Butha Buthe, artefacts from historical cultural 
resources have been found at some places. Therefore, 
the Chance Find Procedures will be included in the 
ESMF in case of chance finds during implementation 
project. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 TBD 

This Policy may be triggered for Angola, given the 
possibility of IP communities being present in the 
project areas. Based on the review of potential project 
locations, an IPPF will be prepared in order determine 
and provide measures to avoid and mitigate potential 
negative impacts. The framework will be specific for 
each group identified and will as well be focused on 
providing positive benefit for this vulnerable 
population. 
OP4.10 is not triggered in Lesotho as there are no 
indigenous people within the project area of influence. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The policy is triggered in Angola and to be determined 
in Lesotho. Although no land acquisition is expected 
under the project and activities will take place on land 
already under the management of agricultural 
research stations or farmers, in some cases land is 
currently fallow or not actively used and local 
communities may have encroached into fields for their 
own farming. While all land which is required for 
project activities belongs to the respective clients, 
there is a risk that informal occupation or use may 
occur during project implementation. OP4.12 is 
therefore triggered as a precautionary measure to 



 
The World Bank  
Agricultural Productivity Program for Southern Africa - Angola & Lesotho (P164486) 

 
 

  
Oct 01, 2017 Page 11 of 13  

     

guide implementation and mitigation measures to 
avoid resettlement impact. An RPF will be prepared in 
Angola and a determination made whether it is 
required for Lesotho during the course of preparation. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

The policy is triggered. Although the project would not 
invest in large scale dam construction the project 
would invest in small productive rural infrastructure, 
such as the establishment or rehabilitation and 
improvement of small-scale irrigation and drainage 
works for research stations under the RCoLs, and 
possibly include small-scale earth dams to harvest and 
store water. These structures, however these would 
generally be far less than 10 m in height. The FAO 
manual on small dams will guide implementation and 
be incorporated into the relevant safeguards 
instruments. The small dams would be designed and 
the construction supervised by a qualified engineer. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 

The policy is not triggered as the project would not 
invest in any large scale irrigation works that would 
adversely affect the quality or quantity of water flow 
within shared waterways. Small scale irrigation within 
the context of technology demonstration or research 
could be financed by the program but would be within 
the context of research facilities and would not exceed 
more than 50  hectares per station/center.  

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
The policy is not triggered as the area where the 
program will be implemented is not known to include 
any disputed areas  

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Feb 28, 2018 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
An ESMF with PMP will be prepared for each country. An additional RPF will be prepared in Angola and if required in 

Lesotho. If OP 4.10 is triggered an IPPF will be prepared for Angola. Both Angola and Lesotho ESMFs will also have a 
screening process for sub-projects under component 1.

B. Introduction and Context 

 
Country Context 

1. The Kingdom of Lesotho is a small, mountainous, landlocked country in Southern Africa with a population of 
2.2 million. It is an open economy, traditionally centered on trade, with textiles, water, and diamonds as its 
main exports. Lesotho is a member of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), the Southern African 
Development Community, and the Common Monetary Area all of which create strong opportunities for regional 
trade. As a member of the Common Monetary Area, its currency is pegged to the South African Rand.   
 

2. Lesotho is one of the poorest countries in the region, with high levels of poverty and inequality.  An estimated 
57 percent of the population lives below the national poverty line and 34 percent fall below the extreme poverty 
line. Income inequality is among the highest in the world. Rural areas, heavily dependent on subsistence and 
semi-subsistence agriculture, account for 70 percent of the population and 87 percent of all people living below 
the poverty line (SCD, 2015). A wide (30 percent) poverty gap, high rates of unemployment, wide prevalence of 
HIV/AIDS, and climate vulnerability further constrain the scope for inclusive growth and improvements in living 
standards. GDP per capita is estimated at US$1,181 (2017) and when adjusted by Purchasing Power Parity is 
equivalent to 16 percent of the world's average.    
  

3. Economic performance declined after 2012 as Lesotho’s growth drivers shifted from exports to high public 
expenditure and consumption. Real annual GDP growth was at a low 2.5 percent in 2016-2017 down from a 4.5 
percent average over the previous five years.  The sharp decline in SACU-related revenues over 2016-2017 and 
increase in public expenditures to 60 percent of GDP, fueled by wage and employment growth in the public 
sector, have resulted in a widening of the fiscal deficit and a difficult economic outlook for the country.  Output 
is estimated to have contracted by 1.6 percent in 2017 and is projected to remain subdued in the near term.

4. Recognizing the inherent unsustainability of this economic model, Lesotho has endorsed a new template for 
development. The recently completed National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP)-II 2018/19 – 2022/23 seeks 
to pursue inclusive, sustainable growth and private sector-led employment creation.  The Government of 
Lesotho (GoL) has identified four productive sectors, viz. agriculture, manufacturing, tourism and creative 
industries and technology and innovation as potential sectors for job creation and inclusive economic growth 
under a new growth path led by the private sector.   

 
 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

5. Agriculture plays a significant role in Lesotho’s economy.  Over 70 percent of the country’s population lives in 
rural areas and depends, directly or indirectly, on agriculture for employment and livelihood.  The sector has 
the highest potential to increase food security, reduce rural poverty, and generate both on- and off-farm 
employment opportunities.  Main crops include maize, sorghum and wheat which are planted as monocrops on 
85 percent of the country’s arable land which comprises 10 percent of Lesotho’s total land area.  Livestock 
contributes 75 percent of total agricultural output, including semi-intensive and intensive production of pigs 
and poultry, as well as extensive (free range) production of goats and sheep on rangelands in the foothills and 
highland areas (Johane, 2011). Sheep and goats, which dominate the livestock sector, are reared mainly for wool 
and mohair.  
 

6. Lesotho’s agricultural sector suffers from low levels of productivity and commercialization which has made 
the country heavily dependent on food imports to meet domestic consumption needs.  Despite 70 percent of 
the rural population engaged in some form of agricultural activity, the sector contributes less than 10 percent 
to the national gross domestic product (GDP). Most of the rural population is engaged in subsistence farming: 
rain-fed, undiversified farming (primarily cereal production) and extensive livestock grazing characterize the 
sector. Productivity challenges in the sector, include, inter alia, limited size of arable land1, unfavorable farm 
structures (average land holding of about 1.0 ha per family), outdated farm technologies and farm management 
practices, limited technical expertise, sub-optimal use of inputs, lack of an adequate irrigation and drainage 
system, weak rural infrastructure, a rudimentary rural advisory system, and limited access to credit and 
investment capital. In addition, the country has experienced severe land degradation.  Massive soil erosion and 
loss of scarce agricultural land have resulted in extremely low agricultural productivity levels: land productivity 
averaged about USD 70 per hectare per year compared to the regional average of about USD 120 per hectare 
per year for the period 2008-2013; cereal yields average less than 1,000 kg per hectare, failing to meet the SADC 
RISDP target of achieving at least 2,000 kg per hectare2. Consequently, marketable surplus remains low.  A 
nascent private sector further constrains commercialization. Private sector activity in Lesotho is dominated by 
micro-enterprises, with a marked absence of the small and medium-sized enterprises that drive economic 
growth and job creation in most countries.3  

                                                           
1 While the agricultural land area of 2.36 million ha accounts for 78 percent of total land area, only 357,000 ha (12 percent) 
is suitable for crop production. Most agricultural land is mountain pasture, suited to extensive livestock production – which 
accounts for 75 percent of the total value of agricultural output. FAOSTAT 
2 Charles Nhemachena, Greenwell Matchaya and Sibusiso Nhlengethwa.  Agricultural Growth Trends and Outlook in Lesotho. 2016 
3 A survey of registered business enterprises in 2015 shows that of 9,625 registered business enterprises, 75.6 percent were 
micro-enterprises (1-4 employees) and 37.5 percent had a turnover of less than one million maloti (approximately 
$US70,000). Only 15 percent of the enterprises surveyed were small to medium (5-50 employees), and only 4.3 percent had 
a gross revenue of 1-5 million maloti ($US 70,000-$350,000). This pattern is even more evident in agro-processing and agri-
business. Five large enterprises dominate the food and beverage sector3, with few medium- or micro-enterprises.

7. Climate change poses major challenges to the development of Lesotho’s agricultural sector.  The Inter-

Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) categorizes Lesotho as one of the countries highly vulnerable to 
the impacts of climate change.  The country has a temperate climate with subalpine characteristics and 
experiences regular droughts, floods, frosts, snow, hailstorms, and strong winds. The El Niño-Southern 
Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon particularly affects climate variation in Lesotho (MEMWA, 2013)4. High intra-
seasonal and inter-annual rainfall variability, with frequent droughts, has often resulted in delayed planting or 
farmers not planting at all, reduced seed germination due to hardened soil and lack of water, crops failures, 
deterioration of rangelands and pasture, water scarcity for livestock, and increased food prices of staple grains 
such as maize.5  Chronic droughts have also negatively impacted the livestock sector, resulting in rangeland 
degradation and limiting the carrying capacity of pastoral land. The drought of 2015-16 growing season was the 
most severe on record putting over 534,000 people at risk of food insecurity. The current rain-fed crop 
production system with its focus on maize at the expense of diversification to more drought-tolerant crops 
(sorghum, millet, cowpeas) increases vulnerability to climatic shocks. The crop production system also makes 
limited use of climate smart agricultural technologies such as new varieties, conservation agriculture, 
intercropping, integrated pest management and simple water harvesting technologies, all of which compromise 
productivity. The erratic and severe weather patterns and land degradation reinforce the need to mainstream 
climate resilience in Lesotho’s agricultural sector.  
 

8. Provision of irrigation is critical for addressing climatic risks in Lesotho’s agriculture; however, the subsector 
is beset with challenges. Despite the ready availability of water from the mountains, only 2,600 ha of arable 
land has been developed for irrigation.  Poor management and inadequate maintenance have reduced the area 
under irrigation, with only an estimated 1,200 ha under irrigation in 2014.  The modernization of national water 
resource management policies and institutions has been slow and physical infrastructure has deteriorated due 
to lack of public funds for maintenance. Many pump stations are no longer operational and existing headworks 
and reservoirs have silted up. On-farm irrigation systems have also deteriorated due to ill-defined property 
rights over infrastructure and weak local capacity for management. There are few effective community-based 
irrigation management systems and poor links between the existing institutions and the local public institutions 
responsible for water management. Combating the effects of climate change and increasing productivity 
towards food security and commercialization will require sustained efforts to provide adequate, reliable and 
timely delivery of irrigation to Lesotho’s crop and livestock farmers.    
 

9. Development of high value cash crops, such as fruits and vegetables and potatoes as well as dairy and small-
scale pig and poultry production offer opportunities for moving from uncompetitive maize monocropping 
production to a more diversified production base responsive to climatic risks.  Lesotho’s higher altitude, 
potential for early season production and access to cheap water and labor combine to create favorable 
conditions for the production and export of vegetables, fruit and seed potatoes. Regional demand for fruit and 
vegetables is increasing as urban populations grow, incomes rise, and the popularity of healthy diets increases. 
Higher production and sales of these high value crops would also deepen domestic agricultural markets, 
generate rural employment and improve nutrition. Diversification and commercialization need a much broader 
base than this however, as current commercial vegetable production currently ranges from 100-600 ha and 
commercial potatoes are less than 500 ha. Government and donor support for increased production and

commercialization of small-scale dairy, pig and poultry enterprises will also be necessary, in addition to 
continued support for mohair and fine wool.   
 

10. A more diversified production base, with greater emphasis on horticulture and livestock production also 
offers a means to increase dietary diversity and reduce child malnutrition. Lesotho’s high rates of child 
malnutrition are attributed to poverty, low dietary diversity and inadequate consumption of fruits and 
vegetables. Limited dietary diversity affects all children - only 23 percent of children have minimum dietary 
diversity and 11 percent have a minimum acceptable diet. Fruit and vegetable availability was estimated at 128 
grams in 2013, compared with the WHO recommended daily intake of 400 grams. Increased horticulture and 
livestock production would contribute to improved nutrition by (a) increasing the availability of fruits and 
vegetables as well as protein-rich foods; and (b) improving incomes and so access to a more diverse diet.   

 
11. Recognizing the significant role of agriculture in Lesotho’s overall economic growth agenda, the Government 

of Lesotho (GoL) is undertaking critical measures to build a commercial and climate resilient agricultural sector.  
The National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) II (2018/19-2022/23), which prioritizes the development of the 
agricultural sector, identifies three broad areas of strategic action: (i) sustainable commercialization and 
diversification of agriculture, (ii) a well-functioning agri-food system, and (iii) rehabilitation of range lands and 
wet lands. Priorities for action within these areas include: (i) improved technology and infrastructure (including 
irrigation and climate smart agriculture); (ii) increased production of high value crop and livestock products; (iii) 
the development of institutional frameworks for producer and industry organizations; (iv) building the capacity 
of farmers to benefit from these institutions; and (v) the development of value chains and agricultural markets. 
The NSDP II also calls for the need to scale up current nutrition systems towards strengthening human capital 
and expanding the use of water harvesting for irrigation. Gender and climate change are indicated as critical 
cross-cutting issues. Several policies and strategies, including Vision 2020, National Climate Change Policy (2017), 
Lesotho Food and Nutrition Policy (2016) and Lesotho Zero Hunger Strategic Review (LZHSR) accord high priority 
to scaling up climate-smart practices and actions to promote agricultural adaptation and increased food security, 
achieving zero hunger by 2030, access to adequate food and healthy diets all year round, ending malnutrition, 
doubling of smallholder productivity and incomes, and eliminating food loss and waste. The GoL has also initiated 
reform of the water sector to promote sustainable and productive use of Lesotho’s water resources.  
 

12. The Bank has provided substantial support to the development of Lesotho’s agriculture sector over the past 
decade. Through the ongoing Smallholder Agricultural Development Project (SADP) as well as Private Sector 
Competitiveness and Economic Diversification Project (PSCED) the Bank has provided financial and technical 
assistance  to improve commercialization and competitiveness in Lesotho’s agricultural sector. SADP is providing 
training and competitive grants to smallholder farmers for improving marketable surplus in several value chains, 
including horticulture (fruit and vegetable production), poultry, piggery and dairy.  The project is also supporting 
the development of an irrigation master plan to assist the government in its efforts of defining strategic priorities 
for improving the irrigation subsector in terms of alignment with agriculture growth potential, improving 
resource utilization, water delivery service, and institutional and financial sustainability and identify a pipeline of 
high priority irrigation investments for support from donors, government, private sector and other non-state 
actors. The PSCED is assisting in building an  enabling business environment, leveraging private investment 
support, providing access to finance to increase productivity and increasing market opportunities in Lesotho’s 
horticulture subsector.  The Bank has also supported the preparation of the Lesotho Climate Smart Agricultural 
Profile which provides an overview of the agricultural challenges in Lesotho and recommends country-specific 
climate smart agricultural practices that can help the country adapt to and mitigate climate change.

13. The proposed Lesotho Climate Smart Agriculture Project (LCSAP) is being prepared at the request of the 
Government of Lesotho to contribute to its efforts in developing a climate smart agricultural sector.  The 
proposed project, an IDA credit in the amount of US$50 million and a Japanese Policy and Human Resources 
Development (PHRD) grant of US$2.0 million aims to harness the triple wins of CSA in Lesotho’s agri-food sector, 
i.e., improved productivity, increased adaptive capacity to climate risks and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.  
Through the provision of technical assistance and investment support, the proposed project would introduce and 
scale up best practices in CSA and sustainable land management thereby mainstreaming climate and 
environmental considerations into agriculture as well incentivize a shift from uncompetitive maize monocropping 
to high potential value chains, all of which are expected to result in positive outcomes of enhanced climate 
resilience, increased commercialization, food security, job creation, improved rural livelihoods and improved 
nutritional outcomes.  

 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
Development Objective(s) (From PAD)  
The development objective of the project is to support increased adoption of climate smart agricultural technologies in 
Lesotho's agriculture, enhanced commercialization and improved dietary diversity among targeted beneficiaries. 
 
 

Key Results 

• Land area brought under climate-smart agriculture and sustainable landscape management  

• Household Commercialization levels (value of produce sold as a % of value of produce 

• Farmers adopting improved agricultural practices 

• Households with increased dietary diversity (disaggregated by women and children) 
 
 
D. Project Description  

 
 

25. The project will build on the achievements and lessons learned under SADP as well as the Lesotho Climate 
Smart Investment Plan (CSIP).  Through a robust, multi-stakeholder process, the CSIP has developed a normative 
vision and CSA goals for Lesotho’s agriculture sector and pathways for achieving the vision and goals. It has 
prioritized key policy actions and investments towards building a productive, climate-resilient and low-
emissions agriculture sector in Lesotho.  The CSA goals, developed under the three pillars of CSA, call for, inter 
alia, increasing yields of major crops, reducing losses across agricultural value chains, including post-harvest 
losses, increasing arable land under stress-tolerant crops, conservation agriculture, and agroforestry as well as 
reduced livestock emissions.  Strategies for achieving these goals include measures reflected in project design, 
i.e. climate resilience and nutrition security (such as agricultural diversification, CSA practices at the farm level, 
stress tolerant crops); commercialization (agricultural value chain, market infrastructure development) and 
capacity development (knowledge development, integrate weather and market advisories using ICT).     
 
26. The following four components are envisaged under the project: (i) Promoting Climate-Resilient 
Agriculture; (ii) Improving Agricultural Commercialization and Nutrition; (iii) Project Management, Coordination 
and Monitroing and Evaluation; and (iv) Contingency Emergency Response.

Component 1: Scaling Up Climate-Smart Agricultural Practices and Advisory Services (Total Cost: US$20.0 
million) 

27. This component aims at strengthening the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers to adjust and modify 
their production systems to minimize the potential future impacts from climate variability. The overall goal is to 
enhance climate resilience through solutions that improve soil health, increase water use efficiency, and 
increase farm productivity and crop diversification. The component focuses on: (i) capacity building for scaling‐
up the adoption of climate‐smart agriculture technologies by farmers and enhancing farm management 
practices aimed at improving soil health, water‐use efficiency, crop diversification, and farm productivity; (ii) 
promoting a more efficient use of surface water accompanied with a more sustainable use of groundwater, 
leading to improved availability and quality of water at the farm level; and (iii) improving access to climate and 
market advisory services through ICT, thereby strengthening farmers’ adaptation and resilience.   
 
Component 2: Improving Agricultural Commecialization and Nutrition (US$30.0 million of which IDA 

US$23.0 million; PHRD Grant US$2.0 million; Beneficiary Contribution US$5.0 million) 

 
28. The objective of this component is to support the development of high potential value chains (VCs) in 
Lesotho’s agricultural sector by strengthening backward and forward linkages within selected VCs with overall 
aim of promoting diversification from uncompetitive maize monocropping to high value cash crops and 
sustainable livestock production animal husbandry, improving productivity, quality, value addition and market 
linkages towards increased agricultural commercialization and improved nutrition.   
 
29. Component interventions will foster the integration of a greater number of smallholder producers that 
dominate Lesotho’s rural landscape in potentially remunerative VCs, promote sustainable intensification of 
production through adoption of  CSA and environmentally friendly agricultural technologies supported under 
Component 1, incentivize contract farming, strengthen horizontal alliances and encourage farmers to establish 
producer groups, strengthen vertical alliances by building trusted commercial partnerships between farmers 
and private agri-businesses and drive enterprise operations towards more lucrative domestic and export 
markets.  Activities under the component are expected to result in the positive outcomes of job creation, 
improved beneficiary incomes, better nutritional outcomes and increased economic opportunities for women 
and youth in the rural sector.   
 
30. The component will finance services to support the formation of new as well as strengthen the existing 
(e.g., those established under SADP-1) farmer groups in Lesotho’s agriculture sector.  Special attention will be 
accorded to the need and interests of women and youth6.  Where feasible, the formation and strengthening of 
horizontal alliances will draw on the Smallholder Horticulture Empowerment Project (SHEP7) approach 
developed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).  This approach shifts smallholder thinking from 
subsistence farming to farming as a business by training farmers to conduct their own market surveys to identify 
local crops with potential for commercialization; training them to grow these crops profitably; organizing 
stakeholder forums to exchange information with other like-minded farmers, input suppliers and potential 
buyers; and by helping them to build good relations with these market agents.

31. Two matching grant programs are envisaged under the component: grants up to US$30,000 for 
smallholder farmers for increased productivity and grants ranging from US$30,000 to US$100,000 to agri-
enterprises for post-harvest infrastructure and management.  All grants will require an equity contribution: 25 
percent for the smaller grants and 40 percent for the larger grants.  The procedures and selection criteria used 
for both matching grant programs will be detailed in a Grant Manual which will be prepared in a manner 
satisfactory to the Bank. The Grant Manual will specify implementation arrangements of the Matching Grant 
Programs and include appropriate technical, fiduciary, environmental and social safeguards provisions to ensure 
that the grant funds will be used for intended purposes only. It will also include the Bank’s Anti-Corruption 
Guidelines and consequences should the agreed commitments not be met. Any changes to the Grant Manual 
during project implementation will require prior Bank approval. The PMU will be responsible for administering 
the Grant Scheme. 
 
32. Towards improved nutrition, the project will support a broad advocacy campaign to increase the 
knowledge among the people of Lesotho of the benefits of dietary diversity. In addition to media campaigns, 
the project will finance the development of industry guidelines for sugar, salt, and fat content, nutrition 
fortification in food products, and labelling through stakeholder consultations. This work will be coordinated by 
the Food and Nutrition Coordination Office (FNCO) in collaboration with CGIAR and other partners. Activities to 
enhance knowledge on diets and nutrition will include nutrition education and demonstrations on production, 
processing, cooking demonstrations, food safety and storage.  The project will also provide grants to individuals 
for increasing household-level production and consumption of safe and nutritious foods. This activity will target 
women to increase their capacity to feed their families a diversified diet through the consumption of inter alia, 
a variety of fruits and vegetables as well as protein-rich food such as eggs and meat. Grants will be provided for 
cultivation of horticulture products as well as purchase and rearing of small livestock and ruminants.  Grants will 
also be provided for small-scale processing which will generate income opportunities for grant recipients.  Under 
this window, small grants in the size of USD 2,000-20,000 (up to 80 percent of total investment cost) will be 
available for production of nutritious foods and small-scale, nutrition-sensitive processing (e.g. purchase of 
small equipment such as dryers, canning). Women and youth will be given priority under this program.  
 
COMPONENT 3: Project Management, Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$7.0 million) 
 
33. This component will support project management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of 
project activities.  The existing Project Management Unit (PMU) within the Ministry of Agriculture and Food 
Security will be responsible for project implementation including fiduciary aspects (including audits); knowledge 
management/communication (including public awareness campaigns); grievance redress mechanism; citizen 
engagement; and monitoring the implementation of safeguard related measures. It will finance PMU staff 
related costs (training etc.), goods, equipment and vehicles, incremental operating costs, 
assessments/analyses/studies for preparation of future projects/operations, and other eligible expenses 
associated with overall project implementation. Support will also be provided for social/results/impact surveys 
at project mid-term as well as project completion. Additional periodic surveys will be supported to improve 
project implementation, for example to assess and improve women and youth participation. The monitoring 
and evaluation (M&E) system will be strengthened to improve the efficiency of data collection, analysis, 
evaluation and reporting.  The capacity of the PMU will be enhanced by hiring additional technical and 
administrative staff as needed,

34. A Contingency Emergency Response Component (CERC) with zero allocation to partially cover emergency 
response via implementation of key activities by the appropriate agencies to respond to the emergency. The 
CERC could also be used to channel additional funds should they become available as a result of an eligible 
emergency. 
 

 
E. Implementation 

 
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 

 
35. Project oversight. The project will be implemented under the direct oversight of Principal Secretary 
MAFS. A Project Management Committee (PMC) that was established under SADP will be maintained given the 
multi-sectoral nature of project interventions. The PMC will include representatives from several ministries 
such as Ministry of Finance (MoF), Ministry of Development Planning (MoDP), Ministry of Agriculture and Food 
Security (MAFS), Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation (MFLR), Ministry of Trade & Industry, Cooperatives 
and Marketing (MTICM), Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MoET), Ministry of Local Government and 
Chieftainship (MLGC). The PMC, which is an extension of the Technical Working Group formed during project 
preparation of the ongoing SADP will review all project reports and Annual Work Plans and Budgets (AWPB). 
The PMC will meet quarterly with the Project Manager acting as the Secretary to the PMC. 

 
36. Project Implementation. The existing Project Management Unit (PMU) within the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Food Security (MAFS)will be responsible for project implementation including fiduciary aspects 
(including audits); knowledge management/communication (including public awareness campaigns); 
grievance redress mechanism; citizen engagement; and monitoring the implementation of safeguard related 
measures. It will finance PMU staff related costs (training etc.), goods, equipment and vehicles, incremental 
operating costs, assessments / analyses / studies for preparation of future projects/operations, and other 
eligible expenses associated with overall project implementation. Support will also be provided for 
social/results/impact surveys at project mid-term as well as project completion. Additional periodic surveys 
will be supported to improve project implementation, for example to assess and improve women and youth 
participation. The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system will be strengthened to improve the efficiency of 
data collection, analysis, evaluation and reporting.

F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 

The Project will be undertaken in all the ten districts of Lesotho–Teyateyaneg, Butha-Buthe, Leribe, 
Mafeteng, Maseru, Mohale’s Hoek, Mokhotlong, Qacha’s Nek, Quthing and Thaba-Tseka. Lesotho is 
predominantly mountainous, with the highlands and mountain zones covering approximately 59 percent of 
the total land area. This land is mostly characterized by steep slopes with fragile soil formations which are 
extensively degraded. The highlands cover approximately 15 percent of the country, while the lowlands and 
Senqu (Orange) River Valley make up approximately 17 percent and 9 percent of the country, respectively. 
The cultivable land is largely confined to the lowlands and highlands along the Western border and the

Senqu River valley in the south, the latter being densely populated and resulting in much pressure on 
natural resources. Land degradation in various forms is a dominant landscape feature in the country, and 
inherent infertile soils affect the productivity of both arable and rangelands. Lesotho is highly susceptible to 
climate-related events such as frost, drought, strong winds, snow, hailstorms and floods, all of which have a 
devastating effect on agricultural productivity, including crop failure and increased incidences of invasive 
plants and infestation by pests. Specific geographical locations for the proposed sub-projects have not been 
identified yet but will be selected on a demand-driven basis during the implementation of the Project. Site-
specific environmental and social assessments will be carried out during implementation and biophysical 
characteristics comprehensively described. The designs of the sub-projects will also incorporate climate 
resilience engineering measures and take into consideration the various environmental conditions which 
could exacerbate impacts on the natural resource base.

The environmental risks of the Project are moderate 
given the potential adverse but manageable impacts 
likely to be generated from the construction and 
operation of small-scale irrigation and drainage 
schemes. The project will finance minor 
rehabilitation works, the purchase and installation of 
on-farm pipeline systems and irrigation auxiliaries, 
irrigation canal and head work repair, provision of 
pressure pipes and network repairs. The project will 
also finance the rehabilitation of existing pump 
stations and construction of water harvesting and 
distribution reservoirs and where feasible also 
establishment and repair of existing vertical wells 
(boreholes). The total command area (hectares) for 
rehabilitation of the on-farm irrigation infrastructure 
is not known, but will be determined from the 
recommendations of the Irrigation Master Plan

currently being developed with full participation of 
key stakeholders, including smallholder farmers who 
will directly benefit from the Project. Key 
environmental impacts associated with the 
construction and operation of irrigation schemes 
include (a) changes to the low flow regime of rivers 
which may have significant negative impacts on 
downstream users, (b) changing hydrological regime 
associated with irrigation schemes may alter the 
capacity of the environment to assimilate water 
soluble pollutants, (c) excessive use of both natural 
and chemical fertilizers may result in excess of 
nutrients which might have impacts on water bodies 
and human health, (d) areas with water tables that 
have a low hydraulic gradient are at risk from 
salinization, (e) reduction in low flows and flood 
flows may alter the river morphology, reducing the 
capacity to transport sediment and thereby causing 
a buildup of sediments in slower moving river 
reaches, (f) irrigation schemes may fail if the 
sediment load of water supply is higher than the 
capacity of the irrigation canals to transport 
sediment loads, (g) irrigation schemes may have 
ecological impacts, particularly in wetland areas 
affecting natural habitats.

changes to low flows (+/-20%) will alter micro-
habitats particularly wetlands.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 
The Project will not support sub-projects located 
within forested areas or plantations as defined 
under OP 4.36. Therefore, the policy is not triggered. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The Pest Management Policy is triggered as agro-
chemicals will be used for irrigation subprojects. 
Based on observations from the ongoing Smallholder 
Agriculture Development Project, the risk of 
pesticide use is considered low to moderate due to 
the small quantities of pesticides currently being 
used in the sub-projects. An Integrated Pest 
Management Plan (IPMP) will be prepared to 
provide guidance on the sustainable application of 
fertilizers and pesticides taking into consideration 
the soil type and slope to ensure protection of both 
surface and ground water. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

The policy is triggered given the likelihood of chance 
finds in conjunction with earth works and/or an 
encounter of graveyard sites from the experience 
implementing infrastructure projects in Lesotho.The 
ESMF will include Physical Cultural Resources 
Management Plan (PCRMP) that includes measures 
for avoiding and mitigating any adverse impacts on 
physical cultural resources as well as providing 
Chance Find Procedures (CFP).  The CFP will entail 
measures to screen for and manage potential 
impacts on cultural heritage or property that could 
be affected by project activities. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
The policy will not be triggered as there are no 
indigenous peoples in Lesotho. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

OP 4.12 will be triggered. The project will likely 
expand the irrigation service area; however, this will 
only be confirmed once the Irrigation Master Plan 
has been prepared and investments to be supported 
under SADP-2 are identified for support during 
project implementation. At this stage while it is 
unknown whether there will be any land acquisitions 
as a direct result of the project, there might be 
restricted access to resources (whether related to 
private or communal resources) related to 
rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure and 
therefore Involuntary Resettlement OP 4.12 is 
triggered to address any adverse impacts.  Since the 
exact location of these structures is not known, a 
Resettlement Policy Framework will be prepared, 
consulted and disclosed prior to appraisal. The

Resettlement Policy Framework will guide the 
preparation of Resettlement Action Plans. The 
Resettlement Policy Framework will guide the PMU 
in avoidance, minimization and mitigation of any 
potential resettlement impact. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

This policy has been triggered as a precautionary 
measure. At this stage, Tthere is insufficient 
information to determine whether irrigation 
schemes and drainage canals would rely on water 
from existing dams or new small dams would need 
to be supported under the project. An exclusion 
clause will be included in the ESMF indicating that 
the project would not support activities that are high 
risk and trigger a full environmental assessment. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 

Exception notification to be sent to riparian states 
will be requested since the proposed small-scale 
irrigation schemes will not adversely change the 
quantity and quality of water flows to other riparian 
states.  In addition, the proposed schemes will not 
be adversely affected by the use of water 
downstream by the other riparian states. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 

The project will not finance activities located in any 
known areas under territorial dispute as defined in 
OP 7.60. Therefore, the 
policy is not triggered. 

 
 

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
Potential environmental impacts are anticipated under Component 1: Support for Irrigation and Component 2: 
Agricultural Commercialization. The provision of grants may result in agricultural intensification and increased 
application of fertilizers and pesticides by grant recipients.  The grants will be awarded based on screening criteria set 
forth in the ESMF/ IPMP currently under preparation. The screening criteria as set forth in the ESMF will help to  
screen out project activities corresponding to a category A, and to provide adequate due diligence on a case-by-case 
basis for the grants. The approach outlined in the ESMF/IPMP will apply to the matching grants, irrigation 
rehabilitation and any activity that would be proposed to be financed within the project or the subsequent AFs.  
The environmental impacts associated with the grants program and irrigation rehab should be readily mitigated 
through sound construction practices (dust and noise, waste management, material sourcing) while the operational 
impacts can be mitigated through environmentally friendly farming approaches (manure management, waste 
disposal, emissions from food processing facilities, improved water resource use). 
Under Component 1rehabilitation of the irrigation schemes is foreseen to lead to better management of water

resources. This activity will potentially entail minor construction related impacts that can be mitigated through a site-
specific ESMP.  The overall project would lead to an increase in agricultural practices therefore having implications on 
pest management, which should apply and follow the Integrated Pest Management Plan as prepared under the ESMF.   
 
The potential social issues are likely to be on restriction to land use and access and possible land acquisition for the 
rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure and agricultural commercialization activities. The project will likely expand 
the irrigation service area; however, this will only be confirmed once the Irrigation Master Plan has been prepared and 
investments to be supported under SADP-2 are identified for support during project implementation. At this stage 
while it is unknown whether there will be any land acquisitions as a direct result of the project, there might be 
restricted access to resources (whether related to private or communal resources) related to rehabilitation of 
irrigation infrastructure and activities under commercialization of agriculture, as a result Involuntary Resettlement OP 
4.12 is triggered to address any adverse impacts.  Since the exact scope of works for rehabilitation of irrigation 
infrastructure and commercialization of agriculture activities is not known, a Resettlement Policy Framework has been 
prepared for the project. The Resettlement Policy Framework will guide the preparation of place specific Resettlement 
Action Plans. The Resettlement Policy Framework will guide the PMU in avoidance, minimization and mitigation of any 
potential resettlement impact. 
 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
There are no long term or indirect impacts associated with the project, beyond the potential increase in agricultural 
production and therefore implications on pest management, where the  Integrated Pest Management Plan as 
prepared under the ESMF should apply. 
 
There are no long term adverse social impacts anticipated for the project, however, the project is expected to have 
significant positive effects on households, by improving dietary diversity in households, increasing climate resilience of 
farmers and promote adoption of climate smart agricultural technologies for enhanced agricultural commercialization. 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
NA 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Government of Lesotho has prepared an ESMF/IPMP and RFP.    
The project will be implemented by the Project Management Unit (PMU) under the MAFS that is currently 
implementing SADP.   The PMU has demonstrated limited capacity in assessing environmental and social (E&S) risks 
and impacts, developing appropriate mitigation measures and implementing and monitoring E&S aspects of the 
project. Currently, it does not have full-time and qualified E&S safeguards specialists to oversee the monitoring and 
implementation of safeguards. Before LCSAP appraisal, the PMU has prepared a comprehensive Environmental and 
Social Management Framework (ESMF) and Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and carried out stakeholder 
consultations in line with both the Lesotho Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) law and regulations and the World 
Bank Safeguard Policies. The ESMF and RPF will provide clear procedures and methodologies for carrying out site-
specific E&S assessments, review, approval and implementations of physical investments (sub-projects) to be financed 
by LCSAP.  During implementation, the PMU will be responsible for carrying out site-specific E&S impacts assessment 
for each sub-project including the associated Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) and Resettlement 
Action Plans (RAPs) according to procedures outlined in the ESMF and RPF. The site-specific ESMPs and RAPs will be 
included in the bidding documents for any civil works to be implemented. The PMU will ensure that all the mitigation

measures recommended in the site-specific ESIAs and RAPs are implemented, monitored and reported in progress 
reports submitted to the Bank.  The Bank will also work with the PMU in recruiting full-time dedicated and qualified 
E&S specialists whose responsibilities will be to screen sub-projects, determine the level and degree of E&S risks and 
impacts, prepare site-specific ESMPs and RAPs, and ensure that mitigation and management measures are 
implemented, monitored and reported in progress reports. The E&S specialists would also train/re-train PMU staff and 
district agriculture officers in the implementation of appropriate mitigation measures for types of impacts expected. 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders include representatives of the Project Management Unit and the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Food Security (MAFS), farmers associations, entrepreneurs, local authorities, irrigation schemes, as well as the 
members of the local communities where the project will be implemented. The ESMF/IPMP, RPF have been subjected 
to public consultations and disclosure before appraisal while each of the subsequent ESMPs and RAPs prepared for 
each specific subproject will also be subjected to disclosure and public consultations. The ESMF/IPMP and RFP will be 
disclosed through the MAFS website and Bank's external website.

Track II - The review did authorize the preparation to continue

I. Introduction and Context
Country Context
1. Burundi is a post-conflict, landlocked, small country with an estimated population in 2013 
of nearly 10.20 million increasing at a rate of 3 percent annually. After more than 13 years of 
conflict, Burundi is now showing positive signs of economic recovery. Over the last 5 years, the 
annual GDP growth in Burundi has consistently remained around 4%. Despite these positive signs, 
the country is unlikely to meet the Millennium Development Goals 2015: (a) the human capital base 
is weak due to limited access to social services; (b) a large majority of youths are under-employed 
because of lack of opportunities; (c) less than 3 percent of the population has access to electricity; 
(d) 52 per cent of children under five are chronically malnourished; and (e) 67 percent of 
Burundians are living below the poverty line. Poverty is overwhelmingly rural and most of the

country’s poor are small-scale farmers. These data explain why Burundi finds itself at the bottom of 
the list of countries for most development indicators. According to the Human Development Index, 
Burundi is ranked 178 out of 186 countries . 
 
2. Following substantial improvement in security and peace consolidation, the Government 
focused its resources to expand basic social services in the country and initiated the modernization 
of existing economic infrastructure and institutions. The Government launched also key reforms 
addressing improved governance, public finance management system, business environment and 
investment climate, etc., which led to the country achieving considerable progress towards macro-
economic stabilization. These efforts have been recognized by the World Bank which in its reports 
“Ease of Doing Business”, ranked Burundi as one of the world’s top economic reformers for 
streamlining business and attracting foreign investment. Nonetheless, Burundi has still to address 
major challenges in terms of good governance, vulnerability to external shocks, diversifying the 
economy, and generating productive employment for its largely young population. 
 
3. The Government of Burundi’s second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP II, 
2012-2015) and the joint International Finance Corporation (IFC)-World Bank Business Plan have 
identified potential growth sectors. The focus is rightly put on modernizing the agricultural sector 
since it accounts for nearly 41 percent of the GDP and about 90 percent of current labor force. 
Burundi’s main traditional export crop - coffee has been identified as a key sub-sector with high 
growth potential which can contribute to achieving the results of the PRSP - Pillar II “Transforming 
Burundi’s economy to generate sustainable, job-creating growth”. Other sub-sectors with potential 
growth identified are tea, cotton and cinchona. Furthermore, as part of it PRSP, the Government 
plans to support corps diversification by promoting nontraditional agricultural exports, including 
horticultural products, essential oils, medicinal plants, avocados, and macadamia nuts.

Sectoral and Institutional Context
4. Burundi has all of the factors which make agricultural investment essential. The sector 
plays a key role in economic growth, poverty reduction, food security and employment. It 
contributes most to gross domestic product, using 90 per cent of Burundi’s labor force and earning 
90 percent of export revenues - primarily from coffee production, which constitutes the key source 
of income for more than 600,000 rural households (about 30 percent of the population).  Despite the 
country's dependence on the primary sector, agriculture has not been modernized and continues to 
depend essentially on subsistence agriculture (1.2 million rural households) using unreliable and 
inefficient technology. Over the past decade the growth rate of agricultural production (2 percent) 
has been less than the growth rate of the population (3.0 percent); which aggravates the country’s 
food security situation. 
 
5. The farms in Burundi are highly fragmented with an average size of less than 0.5 hectare 
and the pressure on the land is increasing due to demographic pressure . The farming systems are 
determined by weather cycles and organized around multiple crops to reduce risk. A comparison of 
crop yields in the country with those in neighboring regions shows that Burundi’s agriculture faces 
major productivity challenges. For example, over the period last years the growth rate in cereal 
productivity in the East African Community (EAC region) increased by 3.13 percent while it 
declined by 0.08 in Burundi. Various interlinked factors contribute to the low agriculture 
productivity in Burundi, for instance: degradation of natural ecosystems and declining soil fertility, 
low use of improved inputs (quality seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, etc.), low use of modern 
technologies, inadequate access to agriculture extension services, poor physical infrastructure

affecting market access and access to improved inputs, limited access to credit, marketing 
constraints and post-harvest losses among others. With the continued fragmentation and scarcity of 
agricultural land, future growth in agricultural production can only be generated from intensification 
and productivity gains. In addition, only market-oriented agriculture will allow rural households an 
adequate livelihood from their small plots, abundant labor, and relatively ample water resources. 
 
6. Burundi’s agricultural sector policy is articulated in its national agricultural strategy 
document adopted in 2008. The latter is based on the priorities identified in the country’s basic 
strategic documents, primarily Outlook 2025 and the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs). 
Furthermore, with the support of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program 
(CAADP), the Government of Burundi put forward a National Agricultural Investment Plan 
(NAIP), covering the period 2012-2017, which was fully integrated with the PRSP II. A top priority 
sub-sector identified within the NAIP for investment is coffee which plays a strategic role in the 
national economy as a source of foreign exchange earnings and incomes for a large number of rural 
households. The Burundi coffee value chain presents considerable potential for growth. Its impact 
extends to several other sectors through backward and forward linkages (inputs, processing, 
transport, financial services, and taxes) and therefore plays a key role in the country for jobs 
creation, food security and poverty reduction. 
 
7. The NAIP main focus are on: (a) the increase in crop and livestock production by raising 
productivity and ensuring optimal management of soil and water resources; and (b) the 
strengthening of human resources capacities of national institutions and farmers organizations. 
Other important elements of the NAIP address common issues such as land tenure and natural 
resources preservation, the development of infrastructure and measures related to agribusiness 
promotion and market access, including an improved investment climate and access to rural finance. 
For the coffee sub-sector, the focus is on increasing productivity associated with actions to promote 
quality, such as rejuvenating orchards, periodic field maintenance, farmers’ organization and 
restructuring and/or modernizing washing facilities through privatization and a niche marketing 
strategy. 
 
8. The NAIP is structured around four major programs as follows: (a) Sustainable growth in 
production and food security; (b) Professional training of farmers and promotion of innovation; (c) 
Development of value chains and agribusiness; and (d) Institution-building for public bodies. The 
NAIP is also promoting partnership between the public and private sectors in implementing its 
programs and achieving its objectives. This proposed project is particularly the type of financing 
which would be shared between the state and private operators, producers and investors. While the 
private sector is encouraged to increase investment in productive, industrial and marketing 
activities, the state needs to establish an environment favorable to the development of the sector. 
Efforts are being undertaken in this direction, for the coffee value chain – private operators are 
encouraged to be involved at several levels, notably at those of export, curing and de-pulping 
stations and roasting. Such initiative should be further promoted and expanded to establish 
sustainable public-private partnerships.  
 
9. The coffee sector: Coffee production is mostly a smallholder based activity with around 122 
million coffee trees and a production area of 70,000 hectares . The species grown is mainly the 
Arabica, though some Robusta is also planted. The average production of coffee cherries is 
estimated at about 164,800 tons and around 20,000 tons of green coffee  - of which about 70-80 
percent are fully washed. Average coffee cherries production per tree is about 1kg which is far

below the yields of 2.5 to 3.0kg observed in other coffee growing areas; for instance in Asia and 
Latin America. Registered production of green coffee  in Burundi in 1990/91 was 33,912 tons while 
observed figure in 2011/12 was about 15,000 tons. The highest pick was registered in 1994/95 with 
40,985 tons. The cyclical swing of seasons sometimes leaves the country with very limited 
quantities to export (5,673 tons in 2003/4).  
 
10. Despite the current low and declining productivity level of the coffee sector in Burundi, it 
continues to play a vital role in the country’s economy and represents the main industry and export 
product – accounting for up to 80 percent of the foreign currency earnings. During the harvest of 
raw and green coffee, the sector plays also a key role in stimulating the rural economy. The 
associated industry (de-pulping and washing stations) and traders inject an important sum of cash 
into rural areas which increases spending in purchase of goods for rural households, manufactured 
products, payment of social expenses, and reimbursement of credit. Furthermore, the construction of 
washing stations in rural areas led to a modest first stage of industrialization, off-farm jobs for local 
labor during the coffee campaign and, most importantly, the development of rural access roads to 
the washing stations which are also used for other purposes.  
 
11. The coffee industry was one of the priority sectors targeted for deregulation reforms and 
privatization in the structural adjustment program (initiated in 1986) that aimed to limit the state’s 
involvement in the productive sector. Due to the civil war and subsequent recovery challenges, this 
process (sector reform and privatization of state entities: OCIBU, SODECO and washing stations) 
experienced some delays. But it subsequently led to positive developments, among others: (a) the 
establishment of a new regulatory body (ARFIC) and an inter-professional association 
(INTERCAFE); and (b) an effective deregulation of de-pulping and export through the construction 
of new washing stations by private investors and SOGESTALs . 
 
12. Today, the government is eager to complete the process of privatization which consists of a 
3rd phase (some 77 washing stations and a mill firm) – although different actors of the value chain 
have different ideas about how this should be carried out. For instance, coffee farmer associations 
are determined to take part in the privatization and the emergence of these associations adds a 
politico-socio-economic dimension to the on-going reform process. Even if some of the competing 
interest groups are small, their diverse political, regional and even ethnic backgrounds prompt the 
coffee reform to be a central peace-building focus for Burundi. Important to note that a recent 
Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) concluded that the earlier privatization (Phases I and 
II) had mostly a positive impact on the incomes and welfare of affected coffee producers. 
 
13. While several steps have been taken toward improving the performance of the Burundi 
coffee sector, it is currently experiencing serious instability and decline which cannot be explained 
by chance or climatic conditions alone. Some of the causes behind this situation: (a) Persistence of 
structural deficiencies, such as inefficiencies in the governance of the value chain. The institutions 
and the actors involved in the value chain are facing several constraints (incomplete reform and 
privatization process, lack of technical and managerial capacity for emerging farmers’ association, 
non-transparent pricing mechanisms, etc.) that hamper their operations and, consequently, limit the 
development of the coffee sector in Burundi; (b) Low productivity due to insufficient technical and 
financial support to farmers. Lack of investments in productivity enhancing technologies following 
the liberalization of the market resulted in low and highly fluctuating productions, poor maintenance 
and degradation of the orchards, low input application as well as pest and disease problems, etc.; (c) 
Limited competitiveness with a decrease in quantity and quality caused by the aging of orchards at

the farm level (28 percent are more than 30 years old and 62 percent are between 9 and 30 years), 
limited technical know-how moving downstream the chain to support quality improvements 
(milling, tasting, etc.); and inefficient marketing structures for promoting the Burundi brand; and (d) 
Primary production has also not kept pace with the expansion of processing capacity, leading to a 
situation in which all raw materials are competitively sought with little price differentiation. Many 
washing stations have experienced low profitability due to high operational costs (partly related to 
capacity underutilization) and management limitations.  
 
14. Under such circumstances it will be extremely difficult for Burundian coffee producers to 
be able to compete with the world coffee industry (or even maintain their competitiveness at the 
regional level). The resulting economic and social consequences are severe for Burundi. Despite 
these weaknesses, the coffee value chain in Burundi is not entirely without its strengths and 
therefore presents  some advantages which justify transformative investments in reversing current 
trends: (a) climate and altitude to produce specialty Arabica coffee that attracts premium world 
market prices; (b) opening of the sector to private investors; (c) local producers interested and 
experienced in growing coffee; (d) emerging farmer associations and private-led governance 
structures; (e) well-established processing infrastructure - washing stations and dry milling capacity 
to support increased production of high quality coffee; (f) increasing worldwide consumption with 
an average annual growth rate of 1.9 percent during the last 50 years and a high demand for 
specialty coffee in developed markets ; and (g) in term of the macro-economic situation of the 
country, Burundi is heavily depending on  coffee export proceeds that failure is not an option. Also, 
since coffee is a perennial and the land is already tied to it for the lifecycle of the tree, it is not 
readily easy to convert and diversify the production base. 
 
15. Against this background, the proposed World Bank project is supporting the Burundi 
Government in implementing its PRSP II and NAIP’s programs - enhancing the productivity and 
competitiveness of the coffee value chain. The proposed project is aligned with the ECCAC 
regional strategy for the development of the coffee sector.  It builds on ongoing operations by the 
World Bank in the country such as PRODEMA (Agriculture and Livestock Modernization Project) 
and PAZDOC (Sustainable Landscape Coffee Project) . It benefits from the coffee sector reforms 
and privatization supported by the World Bank and other development partners (AfD, EU, USAID, 
etc.). It is also complementing on-going operations by IFAD focusing on food security, namely the 
Agricultural Intensification and Value Enhancing Support Project (development of marshlands, 
increase the productivity and yields of rice and other food crops, access to quality inputs and seed, 
etc.), and the Value Chain Development Program (promotion of rice and milk and six other 
secondary value chains).

Relationship to CAS
16. The proposed support project is aligned with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for 
Burundi for FY13-16 that aims to support Burundi’s development as an “increasingly stable, 
competitive and diversified economy with enhanced opportunities for productive employment and 
improved standards of living”. Within the CAS framework, the proposed project supports the first 
strategic objective of increasing competitiveness to achieve inclusive growth and reduce poverty.

II. Proposed Development Objective(s)

enhance coffee quality, for the benefit of smallholders. This will contribute to: (a) improving the 
sector productivity and competitiveness; and (b) the country’s strategic goals of poverty reduction 
and enhanced exports revenues.

Key Results (From PCN)
18. At PDO level, the key results expected from this project are as follow: (a) Increased coffee 
production at the country level at project-end through the combined effect of application of good 
agricultural practices and rejuvenated/renewed plantations; (b) Higher coffee quality demonstrated 
by an increase in the share of coffee sold with price premiums on export; and (c) Enhanced farmers’ 
share of the net FOB price on coffee exports. 
 
19. It is estimated that approximately 200,000 small-scale farmers (from a total of roughly 
600,000 coffee growers at the national level) will directly benefit from the project planned 
activities. These are mostly composed of hillside farmers with less than 1 hectare of land, who 
cultivate an average of 150-250 coffee trees as an integral part of their livelihoods.

III. Preliminary Description
Concept Description
20. Burundi is a small player in international coffee markets and is operating in an environment 
of aggressive competitors. The area where the best results may be realized in terms of the sector 
productivity and competitiveness is not only limited to production increase, but most importantly, 
quality improvement along the value chain and a focus on the lucrative specialty coffee markets. 
Such efforts would certainly allow differentiating the country’s products and also provide a better 
buffer for the inevitable periods of low prices. However, the business principle driving 
improvements needs to be that quality starts at the farm level and can be maintained only through 
proper processing and storage. 
 
21. In this respect, the proposed project will operate through multiple interventions, along 
different segments of the coffee value chain, to address productivity and quality bottlenecks and to 
open new market opportunities to Burundi– the specialty coffee markets.  The proposed project 
would reinforce the private sector role in leading and structuring the sector, namely the coffee 
producers and the industry. More specifically, the following key areas of the value chain will be 
addressed: (a) Governing structure of the value chain and institutional strengthening; (b) increasing 
production and productivity; (c) improving quality and market access. A particular focus would be 
put on greater organization and integration of smallholders into the chain and on more equitable 
sharing of the benefits from improved quality and market access.   
 
22. Component 1 – Institutional strengthening and value chain governance: An essential 
property of the chain is its governance structure, which determines to a considerable extent how 
resources and gains are allocated and flow within the chain. In the case of Burundi, this structure is 
developing but constrained by lack of capacity to implement concerted specific sector policies; 
weak coordination; limited information exchange and non-transparent price mechanisms. The 
project will support streamlining the governance structure of the sector by: (a) reviewing and 
adapting the current intuitional framework to improve its level of effectiveness and efficiency with a 
particular focus on transparency in the decision-making process and on quality and pricing 
mechanism; (b) upgrading the capacities of existing institutions/organizations overseeing the sector; 
and (c) improving the dialogue among the key public and private actors of the chain to arrive at a

consensus on solving value chain bottlenecks. 
 
23. More specifically, the institutional architecture for coffee sector management that the 
project would support strengthening comprises: (a) INTERCAFE -- a stakeholder-driven 
coordinating body that has the mandate for most sector management decisions; (b) ARFIC-- a 
public regulatory authority that ensures that the basic “rules of the game” for managing the sector 
are adequately defined, transparently implemented, and where necessary, enforced by Government 
authority. This intervention will aim also at upgrading the capacities of ARFIC to provide quality, 
inspection and certification services to the coffee industry. The project will support both the 
modernization of existing labs in line with international standards (and possibly their expansion 
within the producing regions) and developing ARFIC human resources capacities for managing 
regulatory areas and for coffee testing; (c) CNAC-- a coffee grower organization largely represented 
in all coffee growing region; and (d) other stakeholder organizations for each of the main sector 
constituencies, to provide representation into the INTERCAFE’s collective decision making on 
sector management. This architecture is broadly similar to successful agriculture value chain 
management elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa and many other producing countries as well, with 
strong public-private sector participation. 
 
24. The project will also support increased consultations among the chain stakeholders; for 
instance, through regular forums to: (a) discuss the various problems and constraints of the sector 
within a “value chain approach”; (b) elaborate (or update) a comprehensive strategy for the coffee 
sector aiming at the general interest of the sector; (c) find harmonized and shared solutions to the 
various challenges facing the sector; (d) eliminate or minimize potential conflicts among the various 
actors in view of the general and common interest; and eventually (e) coordinating donors, 
government and private sector investments to avoid overlap, scale-up impacts, etc. 
 
25. Furthermore, under this component the project will support the development of a Data Base 
on the sector which would provide reliable data on the number of producers, number of trees, 
production, quality, washing stations performance and other ecological and socio-economic factors. 
This Data Base to be initially placed within ARFIC and linked to INTERCAFE, can be further 
expanded to include a formal GI S module that can capture more of the agro-ecological variables 
such as soil types, water sources and other variables that affect coffee quality. This investment will 
constitute an important tool for the value chain actors in terms of planning, monitoring and 
evaluation of their activities and return on investments. It can also be used as an export promotion 
tool (see component 3 below).  
 
26. Component 2 – Support to increased production and productivity: Under this component the 
project will support investments aimed at increasing production and productivity with a focus on: 
(a) the adoption of good agricultural practices - sustainable land management, planting trees, 
nutrition and fertilizer management, pests and diseases control, pruning, rejuvenation (25 percent of 
existing trees), harvesting, quality assessment and improvement, etc.; (b) improving production 
technology and soil fertility; (c) the dissemination of improved varieties to renew old plantations 
(20 percent of existing trees); (d) supporting specific research topics (coffee under shade, variety 
improvement and germplasm enhancement, etc.); and (e) a support fund to facilitate access to 
inputs. 
 
27. In addition special emphasis will be on: (a) linking coffee growers to national agricultural 
research bodies and extension services (public and private) and promoting a two-way flow of

information between these entities; (b) expanding the tested models for productivity enhancement 
implemented as part of the PRODEMA project (community based mechanisms); (c) disseminating 
sustainable water and land management (SWLM) best practices and more diversified plantations, 
with fruit trees, inter-cropping with food crops, etc.; and (d) encouraging south-south exchange for 
coffee production, for instance, with coffee growing countries including Rwanda, Ethiopia and 
Colombia. This exchange will aim at various learning programs: production techniques, extension 
methodologies, coffee under shade, etc., and will build on cooperation already established between 
the PAZDOC project (Sustainable Landscape Coffee Project – GEF) and Columbia coffee growers. 
 
28. For the implementation of the productivity investments, the proposed project will make use 
of INTERCAFE’s current contractual system provision for extension services and supply of inputs, 
and extend these to a larger share of coffee farmers as well as to coffee-specific agronomic and 
processing research. INTERCAFE has a cess revenue mechanism  already in place to finance such 
activities but, at current levels of national coffee production, the cess revenues only permit activities 
at a modest scale. 
 
29. Component 3 – Support to improved quality and market access: The management of quality 
in the coffee value chain is the most immediate instrument growers can use to improve their 
upgrading opportunities and it is a critical element of the current trend toward coffee differentiation. 
Furthermore, it is specifically vital in Burundi where the existence of “potato taste”, a strong off-
flavor resulting from the interaction between agro-climatic conditions and antestia bug infiltration, 
is endemic . Currently, cherries washing stations have only limited capacity to evaluate their coffee 
and do not have the experience or the cupping infrastructure to evaluate their production. In this 
respect, the project will promote quality enhancement activities along the value chain which would 
require changes in the field, at the washing station and at the dry mill. Applying good agricultural 
practices, flotation of cherries at the washing stations reception, meticulous hand sorting during pre-
drying and several other technical improvements are needed before Burundi can be recognized as a 
reliable supplier of coffee specialty markets. Under this component, the project will build on 
successes of recently closed USAID project in the country  and will in particular support the 
following investments: 
 
Sub-component 3.1- Improving quality: 
 
30. Developing cupping capacity: A main focus of this activity will be on educating all value 
chains actors on quality and cupping and establishing cupping labs in main producing areas.  This 
will be achieved by: (a) selecting a number of “leader” coffee washing stations to serve as an initial 
focus for specialty coffee value chain development and as models for other stations to learn from; 
and (b) the selection of a set of second tier washing stations to serve as “training hubs” aimed at 
maximizing the dissemination of production, processing and marketing best practices that will help 
in improving the quality and market access throughout all coffee producing regions in Burundi. 
 
31. Improving washing stations technical, operational and managerial capacities: Under this 
sub-component, assistance will be provided to the managerial staff of the washing stations to 
develop and implement customized Quality Improvement Plans (QIPs), including infrastructure 
improvement, best practices and Quality Control (QC) systems. The production and processing of 
high quality coffees requires sound technical and business management skills and systems. 
Currently the management (and governance) capacity of most private and cooperatively owned 
washing stations needs improvement. This element is critical to obtaining the highest returns,

continued access to financing and sustainability. Furthermore, selected strategic supplier 
certification programs offer substantial price premiums to growers but require the implementation 
of detailed and transparent financial reporting systems. In the particular cases of cooperatives where 
the governance can be problematic, it is also important to maintain a fully transparent financial 
management system to ensure cooperative cohesion. 
 
32. For highly performing washing stations, traceability systems from the plantations to the 
destination market may be introduced. Such systems will enable buyers and sellers to track each lot 
from the time it enters the washing station (or even the field) until it is delivered to its final 
destination. This feature is also an essential element that distinguishes specialty coffee production 
from the production of standard grade coffee. The ITC component described below (parag. 34) will 
be integral to the development of the coffee traceability system and to using this system to its full 
potential. 
 
33. Improving existing processing infrastructure to meet environmental concerns: As pulping 
coffee can be the source of significant environmental problems (pollution of water table and the soil 
surrounding the washing stations, etc.), the project proposes integrating environmental mitigation 
measures in existing (and new) washing stations. These investments (water treatment and recycling) 
can lead to substantial cost reduction of production (reduction of water quantities used for de-
pulping) and, most importantly, responsible environmental stewardship is not only a best practice, 
but is an obligation for certification to several preferred supplier programs such as the Neumann 
Kaffee Gruppe (NKG) and the Starbucks’ C.A.F.E. Practices Program. 
 
34. Developing an information technology and communication system specific to the sector: 
Wireless internet access is now available in much of Burundi, presenting an exciting opportunity for 
washing stations to broaden their horizon in terms of technology access, learning opportunities and 
direct communications with buyers. The Data Base described in parag. 25 above can also be 
expanded to track and report on key performance characteristics of all washing stations for purposes 
of monitoring and planning and assessing the impacts of investments in quality improvement. 
Similarly, the Data Base can serve as an important tool for export promotion, accessible to buyers 
interested in visiting and buying Burundi’s coffee. Hot-links to individual washing stations sites will 
allow buyers to download fact sheets, learn about the coffee characteristics, and communicate 
directly with the stations that interest them most. From a basic training point of view, access to the 
internet by washing stations staff will be a powerful tool for the dissemination of training materials 
across the country. Other countries, particularly in Latin America and more recently in Rwanda 
have benefited greatly from the development of information and communications technologies. 
Burundi will be no different in this regard.  
 
Sub-component 3.2- Marketing and promoting the Burundi Coffee brand:  
 
35. Burundi must learn to market its coffee to the new consumers and also minimize the risk 
and uncertainties associated with coffee production, processing and marketing. In addition to the 
investments made on increasing production and productivity, profiling of coffee quality for more 
focused marketing, upgrading t he processing infrastructure, etc., this component of the project will 
support investments in: (a) building a recognizable image for Burundi’s coffee, including, a country 
logo, brochures, standardized washing station fact sheets, coffee maps and other information that 
may be useful to coffee markets; (b) developing a reliable coffee industry intelligence and 
forecasting system; (c) establishing direct sales relationships with roasters and buyers; and (d)

introducing other innovative promotional activities such as buyer tours, certifications strategies, 
competitions such as the “cup of excellence”, and many other features that will place Burundi’s 
coffees in some of the very best markets in the world. These activities will focus on cultivating 
appropriate contacts and potential coffee relationships in North America, Europe, Japan and other 
emerging markets such as China and Russia. 
 
36. This component of the program will require the full coordination of investments and 
activities at multiple levels, including growers, washing stations, mills and other supporting 
institutions. A key player in this process will be INTERCAFE which would be reinforced to take a 
lead role in coordinating these activities and promoting the Burundi coffee brand. 
 
37. International Finance Corporation (IFC): The IFC Advisory Services Department has been 
supporting the 3rd phase of the coffee sector privatization. A main focus of IFC assistance was to 
advice on financing options for the coffee growers to buy shares of washing stations and to develop 
a target list of experienced international investors in the coffee sector who may be interested in the 
opportunity offered by the privatization. Further support will be sought from IFC, in particular for 
developing industry partnership and linkages with potential international specialty coffee buyers. 
 
38. Component 4 – Program coordination, monitoring and knowledge management: This 
component will facilitate: (a) administrative, technical, and financial management of the program; 
(b) coordination among all institutional partners to ensure efficient flow of information and support 
to all value chain actors, in particular the small coffee growers; (c) effective contractual 
arrangements with key implementing partners (INTERCAFE, CNAC, ARFIC, etc.) and other 
private sector operators; (d) monitoring and evaluation of the performance and the financial, 
environmental, and social impact of the program; and (e) development of communication activities 
to publicize and disseminate the project results, best practices and success stories.  
 
39. Inclusion of youth and women: This population already active in the coffee value chain 
(trees maintenance, harvesting, grading, etc.) will be systematically considered in all project’s 
interventions. In line with the PRSP-2 and the National Gender Policy, a special focus will be given 
to promoting increased youth employment (both women and men) in all segments of the value chain 
by involving them in technical and entrepreneurial training programs and other planned 
developments actions. The project will aim at a target of 50 percent of youth and women directly 
benefiting from the project supported activities. 
 
40. Project costs: The indicative cost for the Coffee Competitiveness Support Project is US
$50.00 million. The proposed Bank-financed support would cost about US$45.00 million. It is 
expected that the beneficiaries (INTERCAFE, ARFIC and CNAC) will contribute up to US$5.00 
million. Furthermore, a GEF project is being considered for potential co-financing of selected 
productivity enhancement activities (PAZDOC: Sustainable Landscape Coffee Project - US$ 4.2 
million). Finally, USAID and the French Development Agency (AfD) are preparing parallel 
financing for the sector with a focus on productivity and trade issues. The exact amount for this 
financing is not yet defined, but is expected to be made available in the 2015 fiscal year. 
Coordination with these projects is foreseen to ensure complementarities and cost effectiveness. 
 
41. Categories of expenditures: For all project’s components, there will be various categories of 
expenditures including: (a) civil and rural works – case of upgrading the processing infrastructure

B. Introduction and Context 

 
Country Context  
1. Mozambique is a southeast African country, with a population of about 29 million people1, of which about 70 
percent reside in the rural areas.  It is estimated that about 90 percent of the rural population depend on agriculture 
as the main source of their livelihood.  With the current population growth rate of 2.7%, Mozambique’s population is 
expected to reach 46 million by 2040. The country is endowed with potentially large arable land, water, energy, gas 
and mineral resources; and is also strategically located to support economic development in the region.  

2. Poverty levels remain high and economic growth has been highly inequitable. Despite significant economic 
growth and macroeconomic stability over the last two decades between 1995 and 2015, rapid economic growth rates 
have not translated into poverty reduction. The country ranks 180 out of a total of 187 countries in the 2015 Human 
Development Index as reported by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and more than half of its 
population live in poverty2. Approximately, half (43 percent)2 of the children under age of five in Mozambique are 
stunted due to long-term effects of malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. Economic growth has been driven 
primarily by few large-scale capital investment projects, with very limited benefits to the poor living in the rural areas. 
Poverty is particularly persistent in the country’s two most populous provinces, Nampula and Zambezia, where poverty 
rates have increased, while the rest of the country has experienced reduction in the poverty rates by over 10% between 
2003 and 2015.  

3. The country’s near-term economic prospects have been recently worsened by political and economic 
instability. Against the backdrop of the longer-term challenge of stimulating more inclusive growth, political and

economic developments in 2016 led to a rapid and dramatic deterioration in Mozambique’s macroeconomic 
framework. With large unreported debts and increased violence, the fast growth economy pre- 2016 slowed down 
significantly marked by high inflation and depreciation of local currency, coupled with falling commodity prices and 
exports. The country also suffered from the El Ninõ effects that led to extremely low rainfalls and a prolonged drought 
(2014 to 2018) which resulted in limited water supply and low agricultural productivity. This led to a humanitarian crisis 
in some of the most critical regions of the country. 

4. However, medium-term economic prospects appear positive as the country recovers from the recent 
economic crisis. Real GDP growth fell below four percent in 2016, but is expected to pick up in the range of five to six 
percent in 2018. Inflation has stabilized at around 18%, following some tight monetary policy reforms to curb currency 
depreciation and fiscal deterioration. Amidst a medium growth rate forecast, the country still faces a number of 
development constraints, including high-dependence on rain-fed agriculture; limited access to basic services such as 
water supply and electricity; and lack of resilience to climatic events due to limited infrastructure and institutional 
capacity, among others.  

5. Mozambique is among the most affected countries by climate change in Sub-Saharan Africa. Globally, 
Mozambique ranks 36th in terms of vulnerability and 144th in terms of readiness3, indicating significant risk to national 
social and economic development. The country has also been experiencing high rainfall variability, with more frequent 
droughts and floods. Highly variable rainfall, combined with limited water storage and flood control infrastructure, are 
among the main factors contributing to crop losses.  The pattern, frequency and severity of floods and droughts are 
also changing over time with significant adverse implications for agriculture productivity and production. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 

6. Agriculture is the largest economic sector in Mozambique. The agriculture sector accounts for 26 percent of 
GDP and employs 78 percent of the labor force. However, most of the population is engaged in smallholder, rain-fed 
subsistence agriculture which frequently suffers from climate-induced shocks with significant negative impacts for 
overall economic growth and poverty reduction. Only about 10 percent of its 36 million ha of arable land is currently 
under cultivation. In 2012, there were about 3.9 million farms in Mozambique, of which 99 percent were smallholders, 
and only about 1 percent were medium and large scale commercially-oriented farms involved in competitive value 
chains, primarily for cash crops. More recently, however, there is an emerging trend and potential for the involvement 
of commercially-oriented smallholders in the value chains of horticulture and other crops as the case the out-growers’ 
systems develop under the implementation of the Sustainable Irrigation Development Project (PROIRRI). 

7. Low agricultural productivity is a binding constraint to Mozambique’s economic growth and poverty 
reduction. The country’s agriculture productivity levels are lower than the average of the low-income countries in 
southern Africa, particularly for maize and rice, two important crops for food security and trade in the region. According 
to FAO statistics 2016, the average yield of maize in Mozambique is 35 percent lower compared to Malawi and 76 
percent lower compared to Zambia. Average rice yields are similarly lower in Mozambique and are estimated at 60 
percent lower compared to Malawi and 50 percent lower compared to Zambia.  Key constraints include limited use of 
improved crop varieties (less than 3 percent of farmers); limited use of fertilizers (less than 5 percent of the farmers); 
inadequate agricultural support services, including extension (there are only 1,200 agricultural extension officers 
employed by the public sector in the country); very small area under irrigation (2.5 percent of the cultivated area); 
limited access to agricultural credit; limited access to mechanization and animal traction services (less than 9.5 percent

vulnerability to climate change and other global challenges in combination with its readiness to improve resilience.

of farmers used animal traction in 2014); and low connectivity and limited access to markets for inputs and outputs 
(road networks provide access to only about 33 percent of the rural population). Moreover, climate-related events and 
an inadequate land rights system present a substantial risk to agriculture productivity and sustainability and reduce 
the efficiency of land use. 

8. A gender gap persists in agricultural productivity in Mozambique. Female headed households tend to be 
poorer, and lack access to productive assets and labor. In addition, they are less likely to adopt improved technologies. 
As a result, they tend to be less productive than male headed households. In 2014, the average maize yield among 
female headed households was 50 kg less than average among male headed households, which represents an 8 percent 
yield gap. This result is consistent with the findings of the literature on agricultural productivity in sub-Saharan Africa.  

9. The provinces of Manica, Nampula, Sofala and Zambézia have the highest agriculture potential, covering some 
of the most fertile soils in the country, along the Zambezi river basin, which accounts for about 17% of the irrigable 
land and 47% of the country’s water resources.4 Also, these four provinces are home to about 1.85 million smallholder 
farmers or 47% of all the country’s smallholder farmers. Nampula and Zambézia provinces face specific challenges: it 
is estimated that 11.21 million people or about 40 percent of the population in Mozambique live in these two provinces, 
but due to limited accessibility, rural households are more isolated and income from farm activities is three times lower 
as compared with the rest of country. In addition, there are generally low levels of irrigation coverage, and current 
investment patterns are not consistent with the highest-potential agriculture areas. 

10. Irrigation has the potential to significantly enhance smallholder agriculture productivity. Mozambique has a 
potential to irrigate 3 million ha. However, only about 180,000 ha are equipped with irrigation infrastructure, and only 
about half of this is currently fully operational. Thus, only about 3 percent of the country’s irrigation potential is 
currently being exploited. Under the World Bank financed PROIRRI – Sustainable Irrigation Development Project 
(P107598, closing in December 2018), smallholder farmers have doubled their productivity in vegetable crops and 
increased cropping intensity to three harvests per year from investments in improved irrigation infrastructure and 
services. PROIRRI developed a total of 3,000 ha under irrigation; out of which 1,700 ha for rice, 800 ha for horticulture 
and 500 ha for out-grower crops.  

11. The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MASA) is the lead institution for agriculture development. 
MASA is responsible for formulating and implementing agricultural policies at the national level, including agrarian 
services, crop development, livestock, irrigation, forestry and food security. Irrigation development is the responsibility 
of the National Irrigation Institute (INIR) under MASA. INIR works in close collaboration with the other MASA 
departments responsible for agriculture and extension services, such as the National Directorate of Agriculture and 
Silviculture, the National Directorate of Agriculture Extension; and the Agriculture Development Fund which finances 
agriculture projects. Other relevant institutions for irrigation development include the National Directorate of Water 
Resources Management from the Ministry of Public Works, Housing and Water Resources (MOPHRH), which is 
responsible for water resources planning and allocation, as well as the development and operation of major hydraulic 
works through the Regional Water Administrations; and the National Directorate of Land and Forestry in the Ministry 
of Land, Environment and Rural Development (MITADER), which is responsible for land allocation and titling. 

12. INIR was created by the Council of Ministers Decree 9/2012 of May 11th, with legal, technical and 
administrative autonomy to promote the development of an efficient and sustainable irrigation sector in the 
country. Currently INIR focuses on technical assistance to small irrigation schemes, including the oversight of design 
and construction supervision of irrigation rehabilitation, as it lacks the technical capacity to do the design and 
construction supervision of these rehabilitation investments in new irrigated areas. INIR is also responsible for

oversight of two large state-owned irrigation enterprises operating a total of 41,000 ha of irrigated land along the 
Limpopo river basin (23,000 ha in Chokwe and 18,000ha in Xai-Xai). Other large irrigation schemes are owned and fully 
managed by private agribusiness enterprises engaged in sugar cane production along the major river basins. 

13. In 2016, the National Irrigation Program (PNI) which was approved by the Government. The National Irrigation 
Program consists of a series of reforms and investments to address critical irrigation development needs and medium-
term food security targets for the country. MASA developed three scenarios to implement the PNI, moderate, medium 
and high. In the moderate scenario, about U$ 1 billion is needed to develop a minimum of 122,500 ha (32,000 ha public 
and 90,500 ha private) of irrigated land by 2042. The initial phase of the program is focused on strengthening MASA’s 
institutional capacity to plan irrigation infrastructure and related services and to establish and provide training to Water 
User Groups and Water Users Associations (WUGs and WUAs) to improve on-farm water management, and operations 
and maintenance (O&M) of the irrigation schemes. Moreover, MASA intends to coordinate with relevant sector 
institutions to promote agriculture intensification and market linkages for smallholder farmers.  

14. To support the PNI, the Government of Mozambique has requested the World Bank to support INIR’s capacity 
building program and finance priority irrigation infrastructure investments along the Central-Northern region. Under 
the PROIRRI, the World Bank supported key sector reforms, including the development of the PNI, the Water User 
Associations Decree Law5, and the draft regulations for private sector engagement on irrigation development. PROIRRI 
also financed the construction of 3,000 ha priority smallholder irrigation schemes in Manica, Sofala and Zambézia 
provinces, including the establishment and training of Water User Associations (WUAs) and Water User Groups 
(WUGs), and facilitated market linkages through existing agribusinesses. Through the Agriculture and Natural 
Resources Landscape Management (SUSTENTA) Project (P149620, approved by the Board on June 30, 2016) the Bank 
is supporting small emerging commercial farmers (SECF) and strengthening market linkages in a landscape approach 
in ten districts of Nampula and Zambézia. IRRIGA will build capacity for planning, design, construction and operation 
of irrigation infrastructure as proposed under the PNI, and further develop services required to enhance agriculture 
productivity in the northern-central region of the country. The IRRIGA project therefore builds on PROIRRI 
achievements and partners with SUSTENTA to maximize value chain development.  

15. The Government has also requested project support for the establishment at the central level agriculture 
investment management unit (AIMU) that will be responsible to coordinate all donor support to the sector. 
Participation of the World Bank is therefore key to contribute to the implementation of the PNI, and is expected to 
help catalyze additional financial contributions from the other development partners and the private sector. The World 
Bank has been a long-standing and valued partner in the agriculture sector in Mozambique, supporting the 
development of institutional reforms, as well as infrastructure investments. The proposed investment operation will 
build upon and leverage the World Bank’s deep involvement in the agriculture sector over time. 

16. The Bank support will be through a Series of Projects (SOP) to support MASA in the implementation of the 
National Agriculture Sector Investment Plan (PNISA).  The SOP will support a Program aimed to increase farmers’ 
productivity and improve rural livelihoods through increased access to irrigation and markets. The program will also 
fund the rehabilitation of a combined amount of 8,000 hectares of irrigated land, benefiting 12,000 smallholder 
farmers. The project description below and appraisal details refer to the first Project (SOP1).

C. Higher Level Objectives to which the Project Contributes 

17. The project is aligned with the Country Partnership Framework (CPF, FY17-21)6 which acknowledges low 
agriculture productivity as a major constraint to economic growth and poverty reduction. Specifically, the project 
contributes to the Focus Area 1 of the CPF on Promoting Diversified Growth and Enhanced Productivity and the Focus 
Area 2 of the CPF on Investing in Human Capital.  

18. The project addresses the Government of Mozambique’s priorities. Irrigation development is a strategic 
objective under Priority III (promote jobs, productivity and competitiveness) and priority IV (develop social and 
economic infrastructure) of the Government’s 5-year Plan 2015-2019. The project also supports the Strategic Plan for 
the Development of Agriculture Sector, 2010-2019 (PEDSA) and the National Agriculture Sector Investment Plan 
(PNISA), 2014-2019, which aim at increasing food security and income of agricultural producers in a competitive and 
sustainable manner, while guaranteeing social and gender equity.  

19. The project also contributes to the World Bank Group’s (WBG’s) twin goals of ending extreme poverty and 
promoting shared prosperity. Improved agriculture and irrigation practices will contribute to increase agriculture 
productivity and income generation for the rural communities in Mozambique. It will also contribute to improvements 
in human nutrition by improving the quality and quantity of food and reducing food insecurity. Moreover, the project 
will contribute to women empowerment by improving access to water and enable multi-seasonal production, as well 
as establishing participatory governing bodies for water management. In addition, the project will promote private 
sector participation mainly through the market linkages and where possible, through public-private partnerships to 
invest and operate small irrigation schemes. 

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
The proposed Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve smallholder agriculture productivity and market 
access in the project areas developed with irrigation and provide immediate and effective response to an eligible crisis 
or emergency. The Program objective of the Series of Projects is the same as the PDO of this Project. 
 
20. The key PDO-level results indicators for the proposed project are: 

• Average crop yield of selected commodities in irrigated production systems; 

• Proportion of the production marketed for selected commodities;  

• Farmers reached with agricultural assets or services (desegregated by gender); and 

• Number of beneficiaries (desegregated by gender) 

 
D. Project Description  
21. The first phase of the project (SOP1) is expected to improve agriculture productivity and market access to 
smallholder on 3,000 hectares of irrigated land rehabilitated under PROIRRI and on additional 3,000 hectares of 
irrigated land to be rehabilitated under the project for a total of 6,000 hectares. While investments in agricultural 
intensification and market access will be primarily in these 6,000 hectares, they will be also extended to areas beyond 
those rehabilitated irrigation areas (in coordination with and involvement of the private agribusiness sector) as the

opportunity arise. The IRRIGA project will establish and strengthen WUGs and WUAs, improve water service delivery 
and on-farm water management, expedite the introduction and transfer of improved agriculture technology, and 
improve the input and output market linkages to irrigated and non-irrigated areas.  

22. The project will be implemented in four selected provinces - Manica, Nampula, Sofala and Zambezia. The main 
criteria for the selection of these four provinces were: (a) significant agricultural potential; (b) availability of water for 
irrigation in areas currently or formerly irrigated; (c) potential for complementarity with other Bank- funded agriculture 
operations and other partners; (d) large share of population being rural and involved in agriculture for their livelihood; 
(e) high level of poverty; (f) potential for linkages with the private agribusiness sector and other development projects; 
and (f) availability of recently rehabilitated irrigation schemes under PROIRRI. 

23. The project will finance the following five components: (i) institutional capacity building; (ii) smallholder 
irrigation development and management; (iii) agriculture intensification and market linkages; (iv) project management, 
monitoring and evaluation; and (v) contingency and emergency response. Below is the summary description for each 
component. Detailed project description is presented in Annex 1. 

24. Component 1 - Institutional Capacity Building (US$8 million of IDA Grant). The objectives of this component 
are to strengthen the institutional capacity and to improve the enabling policy environment, and support the regulatory 
framework of the institutions involved in the development of irrigated agriculture, and to enhance beneficiaries’ 
capacity for sustainable development and management of irrigated agriculture. In response to a request from the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, the project will strengthen MASA’s capacity for investment planning, 
implementation, coordination and management of all donor funding for the agriculture sector development in the 
country. This component will finance three main activities: (i)strengthening irrigation institutional capacity; (ii) 
strengthening agriculture institutional capacity and market linkages; and (iii) the establishment the Agriculture 
Investment Management Unit (AIMU). 

25. Sub-component 1.1. Strengthening Irrigation Institutional Capacity. This sub-component will finance technical 
assistance to support INIR to improve the enabling environment in the irrigation sub-sector and develop regulatory 
tools and a professional code of conduct to improve irrigation services delivery. Specifically, this sub-component will 
finance studies, training and equipment to: (i) improve the institutional and regulatory framework for the irrigation 
sector to improve irrigation service delivery; and (ii) establish a national irrigation water monitoring system that will 
collect data at watershed and irrigation perimeter level. These regulatory tools and processes are broadly identified in 
the PNI and include: preparation of the public private partnership (PPP) regulations; develop regulations and contract 
models for partnerships in irrigation, and guidelines for licensing irrigation development in the country; and 
partnerships with formal education systems in the country (e.g. University Eduardo Mondlane, Instituto Superior 
Politecnico de Manica, among others), including provision of internships for irrigation engineering and irrigation 
economics graduates for practical field work up to 12 months of field work.  

26. Sub-component 1.2. Strengthening Agriculture Institutional Capacity and Market Linkages. This sub-
component will finance capacity building of institutions involved in the development of irrigated agriculture, 
specifically: (i) The National Directorate of Planning and International Cooperation (DPCI) at MASA to strength the 
statistic services, agriculture market information systems to collect, process and disseminate market and price 
information (through digital mobile devices) in the country, and provision of training to staff; (ii) the National 
Directorate of Agricultural Extension Services (DNEA) and the Agricultural Research Institute (IIAM) to increase their 
capacity for the dissemination of improved agriculture technologies and practices in the project areas developed with 
irrigation; (iii) the National Directorate of Agriculture and Silviculture (DINAS) to establish a satellite monitoring system 
to monitor the use of all areas developed with irrigation in the country. This subcomponent will also establish an 
“agricultural observatory” to generate reports for decision making for relevant institutions involved in the agriculture

development. These reports will support relevant departments at MASA, including IIAM, DNEA, DNAS, MITADER, 
Ministry of Public Works, Housing and Water resources (MOPHRH), and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MIC), 
including input suppliers, traders and private agribusiness operators to improve their planning to support the 
development of the agriculture sector. 

27. Sub-component 1.3 Agriculture Investment Management Unit. This sub-component will finance technical 
assistance and incremental operating costs for the establishment of AIMU to lead agriculture sector investment 
planning and implementation at MASA. AIMU will report to the Technical Committee, composed by the National and 
General Directors of MASA, and headed by the Permanent Secretary. AIMU will initially manage and implement IRRIGA 
under the strategic guidance and supervision of INIR and then gradually evolve into the MASA operational unit for 
agriculture programs implementation, thus hosting all the MASA’s investment operations with donor funding in close 
coordination with the Policy Unit of MASA, in charge of the PEDSA and PNISA. The goal is to create a strong, long-term 
operational capacity within MASA and achieve economies of scale while reducing the burden on other functional areas 
tasked with regulatory and policy functions. 

28. The AIMU will consist of five teams, including financial management, procurement, safeguards management, 
monitoring and evaluation and technical design and supervision team (TDST). Under the IRRIGA Project, the unit will 
be responsible for the design of irrigation schemes and assurance of technical quality in all phases of the development 
of the irrigation schemes.  

29. Component 2: Smallholder Irrigation Development and Management (US$28 million of IDA Grant). This 
component will finance engineering design of 5,000 ha for irrigation development; and construction supervision, 
equipment and civil and hydraulic works for 3,000 ha of irrigated land in the project areas to improve water availability 
and resilience of irrigation services.  Forty potential districts have been identified in the four beneficiary provinces 
based on Government strategies for agriculture development, market needs and existing agro-climatic conditions, land 
and water availability, and existing markets. The location of the potential districts is presented in MAP 1. Out of the 
3000 ha, 500 ha have already been assessed (feasibility) under PROIRRI and 2,500 ha additional schemes which will be 
further assessed in the first eight months of project implementation to determine the exact scope of irrigation works 
to be financed by the project. The timeline for project implementation is presented in Annex 1. 

30. Sub-component 2.1: Irrigation Infrastructure Investment: This sub-component will finance technical assistance 
for detailed engineering design for 5,000 ha irrigated land, of which 3,000 ha will be rehabilitated and modernized 
under SOP1 and 2,000 in SOP2. The rehabilitation and modernization will consist of: (i) upgrading the water intake and 
transmission main; (ii) rehabilitation and expansion of water collection and storage structures; (iii) upgrading the 
distribution system; (iv)installation of water distribution and control structures; and (v) rehabilitation and protection 
of the catchment area and embankments for conservation and erosion control. The AIMU will be responsible for the 
technical oversight and quality control of the irrigation infrastructures to be constructed under this component. Priority 
will be given to gravity-fed open canal irrigation systems, as they are relatively simple to operate and maintain, and 
are less costly compared to pumped systems. Pumping will be considered, if at all, only for high value crops and under 
exceptional cases. The construction of the irrigation infrastructure will take into consideration environmental and 
social risks and will utilize the relevant safeguards instruments to implement appropriate mitigation measures. 

31. Sub-component 2.2: Irrigation Infrastructure Management: This subcomponent is designed to support the 
establishment and capacity strengthening for the Water User Groups (WUGs) and Associations (WUAs) in all irrigation 
schemes in the project areas to manage, operate, and maintain the irrigation and drainage systems operational. 
Specifically, the project will finance technical and logistical support to establish WUGs and WUAs; develop manuals 
and associated learning materials and media products, and deliver trainings on operation and maintenance of the 
schemes. The project will also finance incremental operating costs for transitional O&M and investment costs for WUAs

operational offices and equipment. 

32. The expected outputs from this subcomponent would be: (i) the establishment of WUGs and WUAs in all areas 
developed with irrigation infrastructure to manage, operate, and maintain the irrigation and drainage systems at 
turnout and tertiary levels, and (ii) improvement of the level of bulk water service delivered to the WUAs. Expected 
benefits include: (a) improved maintenance of irrigation systems; (b) improved water distribution; (c) increased level 
of water fee collection; and (d) enhanced transparency and accountability. 

33. Component 3: Agriculture Intensification and Market Linkages (US$13 million of IDA grant). This component 
will improve productivity, production, cropping intensity, competitiveness and market access for 9,000 smallholder 
farmers cultivating roughly 6,000 ha of land in the project area. This component builds on successful interventions 
models in the country and the region. It will finance training, technical assistance, equipment and matching grants. 
This component will finance three main activities and specific eligibility criteria will be further developed in the PIM to 
ensure equity and avoid double dipping with beneficiaries already receiving assistance under PROIRRI. 

34. Sub-component 3.1. Capacity Building for Smallholder Farmers – Under this sub-component, the project will 
support organization of farmers into producer groups and provide training through Farmers’ Field Schools (FFSs), and 
through the Integrated Program for the Transfer of Agricultural Technologies (PITTA-Programa Integrado de 
Transferência de Tecnologias Agrárias), using methodologies currently under use by MASA.  Training to farmers will 
include: (a) supporting the establishment of smallholder farmers’ organizations and producers’ groups; (b) 
strengthening the knowledge of farmers on improved agricultural practices, technology, inputs and marketing; (c) 
strengthening the functional literacy and numeracy of farmers; (d) improving household nutrition; (e) improving soil 
fertility and integrated nutrient management; (f) promoting climate smart and conservation agriculture and other 
climate smart agriculture technologies and practices; and (g) conducting demonstration trials at the farm level (FFS). 
The project will also support training to staff from the local government institutions and service providers, including 
local NGOs, to provide technical assistance to the project’s smallholder farmer beneficiaries to prepare business plans. 
It is expected that up to a total of 9,000 farmers and 200 Government staff and more than 100 local service providers 
will benefit from the project support. 

35. Sub-component 3.2 Investment Support to Enhance Smallholder Agricultural Production. This subcomponent 
will finance vouchers for eligible farmers to allow access to improved farm technologies.  These would include but not 
be limited to: seeds, inputs, mechanization services such as those using draft animals, power tillers, tractors, etc. for 
individual farmers. The mechanism will enable market access to agricultural inputs and services and improve the 
capacity of suppliers to plan and delivery quality inputs and services based on voucher system. The voucher serve as a 
financial credit for the purchase of inputs and services and will be co-financed by the beneficiary. This approach will 
build on and expands a model promoted in country and in other neighboring countries such as Zambia with FAO 
support, which proved successful in equipping farmers and promoting local input providers.  It is expected that this 
sub-component will assist up to 9,000 farmers, of which half are expected to be women. The Project Implementation 
Manual will specify a sliding scale for financial support, with an increasing co-financing percentage paid by the 
beneficiary as the value of support provided by the project to the farmer increases.  

36. Sub-component 3.3 Matching Grants for Market-led Production and Value Chain Development – This 
subcomponent will finance matching grants to support business proposals to improve production, post-harvest, value 
addition, equipment, storages and marketing facilities. Matching grants will either finance business plans for groups of 
producers (window 1, including equipment, storage facilities, and technical assistance), or for Small and Medium 
Enterprises (window 2, for processing and value addition to improve existing businesses that benefit producers in the 
project area by purchasing production, grading, packaging etc.). Typical investments would include technical assistance 
and equipment to clean, sort, grade, wash, weigh, package, store or any other activity that add value.

37. The matching grant structure will be similar to that implemented under the World Bank financed SUSTENTA 
Project. Window 1 will typically be up to US$100,000 of which 50 percent will be grant, 40 percent credit from a 
commercial bank to be repaid by the beneficiaries and 10 percent beneficiaries own contribution. Window 2 projects 
would be above US$100,000 and up to US$1 million. Specific details of the matching grants schemes will be further 
detailed in the PIM and matching grants manual (MGM).  

38. The eligibility criteria for the grants (see Annex Table A1.3) will take into consideration the capacity level of 
the farmer’s organization, including the availability of a business/investment plan, agronomic skills and experience, 
and alignment with project supported value-chains. The implementation arrangements and grant delivery structure 
will be reflected in the PIM and harmonized with similar programs under implementation by the Government of 
Mozambique.  

39. Component 4: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$6 million of IDA grant). The objective of 
this component is to ensure project management efficiency and efficacy, by ensuring the use of resources in 
accordance with the project’s objectives, procedures, and fiduciary guidelines; and finance monitoring and evaluation 
(M&E) activities during the project implementation and report regularly on implementation status and performance, 
and the achievement of project indicators and development objective. Specifically, the project will finance (i) 
incremental operating costs for project implementation at the national level led by AIMU and at the provincial level 
led by Provincial Implementation Units (PPIUs); and (ii) the establishment of a Management Information System (MIS) 
for irrigated agriculture, and the project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system. 

40. Component 5: Contingency and Emergency Response (US$0). This component will provide immediate response 
in the event of an eligible crisis or emergency. This is a “zero-dollar” Contingency and Emergency Response Component. 
In the case of an adverse event that causes a major disaster, the Government of Mozambique may request the World 
Bank to channel some financial resources from this component to address the emergency. If agreed by the World Bank, 
part of the project resources will be re-allocated to this component to finance any critical emergency activities under 
this component. This component will facilitate access to rapid financing by allowing reallocation of uncommitted 
project funds in the event of a natural disaster, either by a formal declaration of a national or regional state of 
emergency or upon a formal request from the Government of Mozambique. Component 5 will use IDA Immediate 

Response Mechanism. 

 
E. Implementation 

 
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 

 

41. The project will be implemented by MASA at three levels of implementation: the national, provincial and district 
levels (Figure 1). Detailed implementation arrangements are provided in Annex 2 and will be further detailed in the 
PIM.  

42. At the National Level. MASA will be responsible for the overall implementation of the project, in consultation 
with the other relevant Ministries to ensure that the project activities are consistent with the national policies and 
programs. A Project Coordination Committee (PCC), chaired by the Minister (or - by delegation – by the Vice Minister), 
with participation of MOPH, MITADER, and Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIC), will have the overall decision-making 
responsibility regarding the management of the project, review decisions made by AIMU, issue directives to guide 
project interventions, methods and criteria. The PCC will be responsible for the approval of work plans and budgets, 
and oversight on compliance with World Bank fiduciary requirements. The Permanent Secretary of MASA will be the 
executive level head responsible for strategic direction of the project with support from the Technical Committee of 



 

The World Bank  
Smallholder Irrigated Agriculture and Market Access Project (P164431)

the National Directors. AIMU will be responsible for day-to-day management of the project and will be composed by a 
Program Coordinator (PC), a communication specialist, an environmental safeguards specialist, a social safeguards 
specialist, an M&E specialist, a procurement specialist, a financial management specialist and the lead specialists for 
TDST. The detailed composition of the TDST is presented in Annex 2.  

43. AIMU. MASA will establish AIMU at the national level that will be (i) responsible for the project coordination and 
management of fiduciary issues in conformity with the standards and requirements agreed with the World Bank; and 
(ii) manage the project in accordance with the Financing Agreement and other project documents such as Project 
Appraisal document and the PIM.

44. At the provincial level.  Each beneficiary province will have a Provincial Project Implementation Unit (PPIU) with 
a minimum of five staff including provincial coordinator, irrigation engineers, safeguard team and will collaborate with 
beneficiary districts to facilitate the project implementation.   

45. The Provincial Directorate of Agriculture will be responsible for implementation of the project in coordination 
with the provincial government directorates and district governments. A Provincial Project Coordination Committee 
(PPCC), chaired by the Provincial Governor, will oversee project implementation, including monitoring project progress 
at the provincial level and making decisions in line with the objectives and institutional arrangements that are 
consistent with the project document and legal agreements. The PPCC will approve and monitor the implementation 
of activities at provincial level. The Provincial Director of Agriculture (within the provincial government) will be 
responsible for strategic direction of the project at the Provincial level with support from the Provincial Project 
Implementation Unit, (PPIU) headed by a Provincial Project Coordinator (PPC) that will be responsible for day-to-day 
management of the project at the provincial level.  

46. Activity implementation on the ground will primarily be handled by service providers with involvement of local 
technical staff at Provincial Directorate of Agriculture. Component 2 will hire qualified engineering firms to undertake 
the design of the schemes and supervise the construction based on TORs agreed with the World Bank; Component 3 
will be implemented by services providers hired on competitive basis, based on TORs also agreed with the World Bank. 
Component 3 will provide training and demand based support in the e-vouchers for eligible farmers, and farmer groups 
for production, processing and marketing sub-projects. A specific Cost sharing grant will be prepared by the Project to 
guide the implementation of the grants in accordance with World Bank and Government of Mozambique Policies. The 
AIMU, PPIU will be responsible for overall coordination of implementation of the approved projects.   

47. At the District Level. Agricultural activities and marketing take place at district level. Given that the capacity is 
in most cases weak, the project will provide capacity building and targeted technical assistance. The District Office of 
Economic Activities (SDAE) will be responsible for project implementation at the district level, in coordination with 
District Services for Planning and Infrastructures and consultation with the District Administration. The SDAE will be 
actively involved in site identification and general oversight of the irrigation infrastructure development at the district 
level, identification and selection of sub-project proposals for matching grants with the Administrator’s guidance. The 
preparation and implementation of sub-projects for matching grants is at the level of irrigation scheme and smallholder 
farmer groups and associations.  To effectively participate in the implementation of the project, local SDAEs will have 
to carry out their work in accordance with their usual functions (training, extension, technical advice, among others), 
but they will require capacity building. To facilitate this process, the project will assist in: (I) capacity building; (ii) 
provide technical assistance; and (iii)engage service providers to assist local SDAEs. The farmers will also be involved 
in the design and construction works for the irrigation schemes and will be fully responsible for O&M of the schemes. 

 

B. Results Framework and Monitoring and Evaluation 

48. The Project will establish a Progress and Results Information Monitoring System (PRIMS) at MASA to monitor 
the implementation progress and the project outcomes. The system will be programmed as a web-based data 
reporting and management tool that will help: (i) to collect, document, analyze and generate reports on project 
progress and results indicators; (ii) to cross reference annual work plan and budget (AWP&B) tables with progress and 
results information; (iii) to integrate progress and results data of all sub-projects (i.e., monitoring of business plan 
implementation); (iv) to store and document geo-referenced data on seasonal water flow and use, agricultural 
production at plot level, and input/output markets; and (vi) to serve as a project related grievances monitoring 
database. The PRIMS will be procured in the first year of implementation.  



 

The World Bank  
Smallholder Irrigated Agriculture and Market Access Project (P164431) 

 

 

  
Apr 25, 2018 Page 14 of 24  

 

49. The Results Framework (RF) and the arrangements for monitoring results are reported in Section VII. The RF 
will be used to periodically track progress in achieving the project’s objectives. Also, the critical processes to achieve 
the project’s objectives, such as procurement, safeguards, technical assistance and institutional development 
activities, will be closely monitored. The project will rely on existing data sources at MASA and other Government 
agencies including the National Institute of Statistics, supplemented by regular data collection, and special surveys and 
assessment updates will be carried out by contracted specialists. Both quantitative and participatory M&E methods 
will be used to assess the social and gender inclusion of project participants. All teams involved in the implementation 
of the project will participate in the process of data collection, compilation, analysis, and use. The project will finance 
MIS costs under component 4. 

50. MASA will recruit an M&E specialist using project funds to be responsible for tracking progress on project 
results indicators. The M&E specialist, reporting to the AIMU, will be responsible for managing the PRIMS. The PRIMS 
will include an activity-specific database aligned with the annual activity plans and the M&E Plan for all outcome and 
intermediate performance indicators. The M&E specialist will be responsible for regular updating the PRIMS and 
producing quarterly progress reports. Two evaluations of project outputs and outcome will be commissioned, first at 
midterm and the second at completion. An M&E unit will be established within AIMU and the MIS and procedures for 
data collection and reporting will be prepared to the World Bank’s satisfaction. The project will finance M&E costs, 
including the impact evaluations (midterm and completion) as well as the implementation completion report, ICR.  

 
 .    
F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 

The project will support the rehabilitation of irrigation schemes in 3,000 hectares in four provinces of 
central and northern Mozambique: Manica, Sofala, Nampula and Zambézia. The exact locations for the 
interventions have not yet been selected, though they are expected to fall within the above-listed provinces. 
The irrigation schemes will be assessed before investment is considered to ensure, economic, financial, 
social and environmental feasibility. In addition, no infrastructure investment will be made before critical 
issues such as land and water user rights have been fully secured. The project will not support construction 
of large scale irrigation structures to minimize the extent of environmental and social impacts. Priority will 
be given to gravity-fed open irrigation systems, as they are relatively simple to operate and maintain, and 
are less costly compared to the piped systems, and will consist of: diversion weir from the river, main canal 
from the weir to the irrigated area, distribution network canals, drainage network, internal road, protection 
dykes (for flooding risk), and land levelling. Dams are not required because the irrigation schemes will target 
permanent streams/rivers with enough water for irrigation and downstream use. The design and 
construction of the infrastructures will take into consideration the need to avoid and minimize 
environmental and social risks. Under the ongoing PROIRRI project it can be concluded that associated 
negative environmental and social impacts include water abstraction on downstream users, loss of wetland 
habitat because of the irrigation infrastructure needed, point and non-point pollution of water sources, soil 
erosion and siltation, acquisition of land for development of irrigation infrastructure, water and land-use 
related conflicts. However, some other potential impacts may have moderate intensity and significance, as 
well as being non site-specific, such as reduction of downstream water flow and eventual social conflicts 
among downstream water users. IRRIGA is rated as a Category B project, since most of these impacts are

minor or of low-intensity, site-specific, thus relatively straight forward to manage with adequate 
participation of the Local Government entities.

SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

Proposed project investments under Components 2 
and Component 3 involve irrigation and 
infrastructure activities (irrigation related 
infrastructure, grain storage and processing 
facilities). Such investments have a potential of 
causing environmental impacts that require due 
safeguards consideration. Some of the associated 
negative environmental and social impacts include 
water abstraction on downstream users, loss of 
wetland habitat as a result of the irrigation 
infrastructure needed, point and non-point pollution 
of water sources from use of pesticides, fertilizers 
and other agrochemicals, soil erosion and siltation, 
water and land-use related conflicts. The specific 
location/site and scope of all project components 
are not yet known. Therefore, an Environmental and 
Social Management Framework (ESMF) has been 
prepared, consulted upon, and publicly disclosed 
prior to appraisal. Once there is information specific 
to individual sub-projects, site/project specific 
Environmental and Social Management Plans 
(ESMPs) will be prepared during implementation. 
The ESMF includes a set of Environmental and Social 
Clauses (ESC) for project implementers, provisions 
for stakeholder engagement as well as a grievance 
redress mechanisms. 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No 
The project does not expect to involve or invest in 
Private Sector activities as defined under this policy 



 

The World Bank  
Smallholder Irrigated Agriculture and Market Access Project (P164431) 

 

 

  
Apr 25, 2018 Page 16 of 24  

 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

Overall, promotion of irrigation and agriculture 
intensification could lead to some negative impacts 
on natural habitats. Such impacts may include 
natural habitats degradation due to an increased 
land use pressure, water bodies and soil 
contamination from use of pesticides, fertilizers and 
other agrochemicals including reduced quantity and 
quality of water upon which natural habitats 
depend. Hence, OP 4.04 was triggered and the 
borrower prepared an ESMF which includes 
appropriate measures to address any potential 
impacts on natural habitats. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 

The OP/BP4.36 is not triggered. IRRIGA will not have 
any direct or indirect impacts on health and quality 
of forests per this policy definition, or on people 
who depend on forests, as activities will mainly 
involve rehabilitation of existing irrigation schemes. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

Promoting intensification through improved inputs 
under Component 3 may lead to an increased use of 
pesticides (though at a low scale to boost agriculture 
productivity) which  could affect the quality and 
quantity of water or lead to soil contamination and 
degradation including risks to the health and safety 
of the farmers from the use pesticides or 
agrochemicals. To address such impacts the 
borrower has prepared and implemented under 
PROIRRI a Pest Management Plan (PMP) which 
includes guidelines and procedures that are essential 
in disseminating sustainable agricultural practices by 
promoting ecological and biological control of pest 
management. The PMP also contains specific 
measures to address health and safety risks to 
community and farmers due to mishandling of 
pesticides or disposal and storage of empty 
containers. The PMP was duly updated, under 
IRRIGA, tconsulted upon and publicly disclosed prior 
to appraisal. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

The proposed project will involve civil works and 
could potentially involve chance finds of PCR during 
construction. The ESMF include Chance Find 
Procedures. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 

The policy does not apply to Mozambique, as there 
are no populations/communities that meet the 
definition of Indigenous Peoples as described in the 
policy.

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The exact nature and specific location of the project 
interventions (in Manica, Nampula, Sofala and 
Zambezia provinces) will be determined during 
implementation, and because the project will 
finance activities such as civil works for irrigation 
schemes that may disrupt farmers activities  
restricting their access to water and potentially 
resulting in the loss of crops, OP 4.12 has been 
triggered. Land acquisition is expected to be low in 
magnitude and it is unlikely that the rehabilitation 
and expansion of agricultural areas would potentially 
result in physical displacement. Consequently, MASA 
has updated the Resettlement Policy Framework 
(RPF) of the PROIRRI to adequately address issues of 
land acquisition resulting in physical impacts on 
people and/or loss of assets, means of livelihoods or 
resources. 
The RPF sets forth the principles and procedures for 
managing issues of land acquisition requiring 
compensation and/or the physical displacement of 
persons/households. The RPF has been consulted 
and was sill be disclosed both in-country on 15 May 
2018 and by the World Bank on 17 May 2018 prior 
to Appraisal. The RFP includes specific guidance for 
screening subprojects for resettlement and 
livelihood impacts, and for the preparation (prior to 
subproject approval) and subsequent 
implementation of site-specific Resettlement Action 
Plans (RAPs) and/or Abbreviated Resettlement Plans 
(ARAPs). 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

This policy is triggered since IRRIGA will support 
activities that will involve rehabilitation of water 
storage or water control structures, canals and 
rehabilitation of small dams/water diversion weirs. 
The project will not finance any large dams as 
defined under this policy. Nonetheless, the borrower 
prepared an ESMF that includes basic guidelines and 
measures to address potential environmental 
impacts from rehabilitation of small dams. Such 
measures will be included in the project design and 
will be reviewed by qualified engineers prior to 
commencement of the works. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 
IRRIGA will support construction and rehabilitation 
of irrigation schemes along Buzi and Zambezi River 
basins. However, the activities supported by the 



 

The World Bank  
Smallholder Irrigated Agriculture and Market Access Project (P164431) 

 

 

  
Apr 25, 2018 Page 18 of 24  

 

project will have a low likelihood of interference in 
intentional watershed, given the downstream 
location of the areas of the project intervention 
relative to riparian countries (Mozambique is the 
lowest riparian country of these rivers).  LEGEN has 
determined that the project qualifies for an 
exception to the notification requirement in OP 7.50.  
A memo for exception to notification prepared 
which was duly cleared by the AFRVP. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
This policy is not triggered. The area in which the 
project will be implemented is not known to include 
any disputed areas. 

 
 

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The project may have some unintended negative environmental and social impacts such as soil erosion, siltation, 
salinization, water pollution with fertilizers and pesticides, health risks for farmers due to agrochemicals usage, limited 
water availability for downstream users and biodiversity loss in mountain water springs, and loss of wetland habitat as 
a result of the irrigation infrastructures needed. Additionally, expansion of irrigation areas may also result in land 
acquisition and limited water availability for downstream which could then lead to loss of crops and livelihoods with 
potential to generate water and land-use related conflicts. Most of these impacts are minor or of low-intensity, site-
specific and thus relatively straight forward to manage, with involvement of the Local Governments entities and 
WUAs. Nonetheless, some other potential impacts may have moderate intensity and significance, as well as being non 
site-specific, such as reduction of downstream water flow, eventual social conflicts among downstream water users, 
drawing from PROIRRI's identified environmental and social impacts, or maybe labor influx issues with local 
communities. Overall, no potential large scale, significant or irreversible impacts are expected under IRRIGA. 
 
Other impacts associated with the civil works include health and safety of the workers and communities, dust 
pollution, and construction waste/debris. Some of the schemes rehabilitation/expansion works and equipment 
installation will be along the cultivated fields. Although the works will primarily occur along the edges of the fields, 
some works may disrupt farmers activities restricting their access to water and potentially resulting in the loss of 
crops. It is not anticipated that the project will lead to significant land acquisition or significant restrictions on access 
to sources of livelihood. Moreover, some of the construction works may require the hiring of external work force, thus 
leading to the risks of labor influx in rural areas. Such risks should be manageable and will be adequately addressed 
through application of standard Bank safeguard instruments (ESMF, RPF, ESIA/ESMP and RAP).  
 
The predecessor project, PROIRRI continues to face compliance issues. The ESMPs for the subprojects (32 irrigation 
schemes) were recently approved. The PIU has submitted a remediation plan which needs to be consolidated and 
implemented, to which end time and resources will have to be allocated.

Borrower capacity to implement sound safeguard management procedures is low, but improving, therefore although 
global environmental and social impacts from IRRIGA are considered to be moderate, the environmental and social 
risk assessment of the overall project, including the PIU  (AIMU - Agriculture Investment Management Unit) capacity 
to perform adequate project safeguard management and procedures, is considered to be substantial. 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
As examples of potential indirect and/or long term impacts of IRRIGA, downstream water contamination from on-farm 
agro-chemicals application, reduction of downstream water flow and eventual social conflicts among downstream 
water users can be put forward. However, water availability studies were undertaken through other WB financed 
projects in the same target area, such as SUSTENTA and involving National and Regional Water authorities. These 
studies demonstrate that river flows are high and current uses are very low, hence easily accommodate the extra 
water need for IRRIGA and for other future water uses. Recent figures related to water availability, made at river basin 
level (for Lúrio, Meluli, Licungo, Zambezi, Pungoe and Buzi) clearly show that future cumulative water demand with 
IRRIGA ranges from 0.16% to 4.6% of these river's mean annual runoff. The ESMF includes an examination of potential 
cumulative and induced impacts to followed upon during implementation. 
 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
The project will not support construction of large scale irrigation structures in order to minimize likely environmental 
and social impacts. Priority will be given to gravity-fed canal irrigation systems. The feasibility studies, the design, the 
safeguards instruments and construction of the irrigation infrastructures will take into consideration the need to avoid 
and minimize to the extent possible, environmental and social risks. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The project implementation arrangements related to the environmental and social safeguard requirements, national 
legislation and Bank policies, will be under responsibility of the Agriculture Investment Management Unit (AIMU) at 
MASA. 
 
The capacity of MASA to implement safeguard policies is still inadequate, but improving. MASA through AIMU 
(Agriculture Investment Management Unit) is currently implementing other WB funded projects and its overall 
capacity has been gradually strengthened at central ad local levels to address the increasing safeguards risks in this 
sector. AIMU comprises among others, a Project Coordinator and two dedicated safeguards specialists (environmental 
& social) who will ensure management of project’s safeguards requirements. IRRIGA safeguards capacity will build on 
experiences learnt from PROIRRI implementation while also establishing strategic synergies with other WB projects 
coordinated by FNDS (MOZBIO, SUSTENTA) with overlapping geographical area to ensure harmonization of procedures 
and protocols among projects and institutions. In addition, measures are being taken to ensure that the remedial 
measures still pending implementation under the ongoing PROIRRI project are satisfactorily addressed so to serve as 
he basis for IRRIGA safeguards management.  
 
The existing safeguards specialists at central level, will be further assisted at the provincial level by a team of social 
and environmental technicians who will closely oversee implementation and ensure compliance with safeguards 
policies in each of the targeted provinces. In addition, detailed team roles, responsibilities, as well as capacity building 
(training) requirements and procedures for sound management of environmental and social impacts were adequately 
included and budgeted for in the ESMF. A series of regional training seminars/workshops will be organized for all 
actors involved in the implementation of social and environmental safeguards policies, upon project effectiveness.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
During preparation of the ESMF, RPF and PMP a Public Consultation Process was undertaken in all provinces targeted 
by the IRRIGA, plus Maputo province, aiming to inform, hear and gather recommendations from different potentially 
affected and interested groups on project design, environmental and social impacts and risks related with the project 
activities. 
After project approval a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) will be prepared to identify key stakeholders that are 
affected, and/or able to influence project design and its activities while also identifying effective methods and 
structures through which to disseminate project information and to ensure regular, accessible and transparent 
consultation; guide AIMU to build mutually respectful, beneficial and lasting relationships with stakeholders; Establish 
a Grievance Redress Mechanisms; and define roles and responsibilities for the implementation of the SEP. 
The main stakeholders to engage in this project are Farmers, Associations of Farmer, women associations, vulnerable 
groups (youth, elderly, disabled), Ministry of Land, Environment and Rural Development  (MITADER), DPTADER,  
Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, Provincial Directorate of Agriculture and Food Security, District Services of 
Economical Activities (SDAE), District Services of Planning and Infrastructure (SDPI), National Directorate of Water 
Resource Management (DNGRH), Regional Administrations of Water (ARAs), Ministry of Industry and Commerce, 
NGOs, Academia and other ongoing projects such as SUSTENTA, MozFIP, MOZBIO, among others. 
At IRRIGA subproject level, during the prefeasibility phase and through the implementation of the E&S Screening Form 
(ESSF), stakeholders will be consulted in the identification and assessment of the social and environmental risks of a 
proposed project so that project design alternatives can be identified prior to proceeding to project feasibility.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

1. Liberia is a fragile and conflict-affected country with a high vulnerability to external shocks. Two civil wars 
between 1989 and 2003 destroyed the country’s economy, basic infrastructure, and institutional framework 
resulting in poor living conditions for most of the population. Following over twenty-five years of economic 
contraction, Liberia’s economy began to recover in 2004 with the 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growing rate at an average annual 
rate of 7.4 percent from 2004-2013. However, the outbreak of the 
Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in 2014 and a sharp decline in global prices 
for two of the country’s main export commodities (iron ore and 
rubber) disrupted Liberia’s economic recovery, resulting in a 
stagnant real GDP growth in 2015. An incipient recovery began 
around 2017/18 but was short-lived and the GDP contracted again 
by 2.3 percent in 2019.  

2. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exerted increased pressure on 
the economy. Real GDP is expected to contract again by 2.9 percent 
in 2020. During the first half of 2020, output declined in multiple sectors of the economy, including cement 
(45 percent), gold (33 percent), rubber (19 percent), and services (12 percent), reflecting the restriction 
measures implemented to slow the progression of COVID-19 and the weak global environment. A general 
lockdown aimed at containing the spread of the virus was imposed on April 10, 2020 and lifted on July 22, 
2020. Inflationary pressures moderated to 13 percent in June 2020, compared to 29.9 percent in June 2019, 
due to lower fuel prices and tight macroeconomic policy. The depreciation of the Liberian dollar slowed to 
1.5 percent in June 2020 compared to 30.2 percent in June 2019, reflecting an improvement by US$21.1 
million in the trade deficit in Jan-June 2020 period. According to the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL), export 
receipts declined by 4.8 percent in January-June 2020 while the value of imports decreased by 7.4 percent. 
Fiscal policy was also tightened despite the COVID-19 pandemic with the fiscal deficit expected to be 
reduced to 3.7 percent in 2020, down from 6.1 percent in 2019. Nevertheless, the level of the public debt is 
expected to increase in 2020, reflecting mainly the economic contraction and the continued negative trade 
balance. 

3. Poverty remains widespread in Liberia. With a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of just US$600 in 
2018, Liberia is among the ten poorest countries in the world. It also has high income inequality levels with 
an estimated Gini coefficient of 35.5 in 2016. From 2007 to 2014, Liberia’s per capita GDP growth rate

averaged 3.3 percent per year, which helped reduce the poverty rate1 from 68.6 percent in 2007 to 38.6 
percent in 2014. However, from 2014 through 2019 per capita GDP contracted causing the poverty rate to 
rise again to 43.4 percent by 2019. In addition, there are acute rural-urban and gender disparities (urban 
population constitutes around 54 percent), driven by unequal access to land and productive assets, 
infrastructure and public services, and markets for both goods and labor. Liberia ranks 176th out of 189 
countries in the 2019 United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Human Development Index. In the 2020 
Doing Business report, Liberia ranked 175th out of 190 economies on the overall ease of doing business2. In 
terms of gender equality, Liberia ranks 97th out 153 countries in the World Economic Forum’s gender 
equality index and 17th out of 34 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. 

4. Liberia’s development and poverty reduction programs are severely constrained by lack of road access. 
With only 750 km of paved roads, Liberia is below SSA average road density. The 2018 World Bank Logistics 
Performance Index ranked the country 143rd out of 160 countries.  Nearly 60 percent of rural Liberians lack 
access to an all-weather road, limiting their ability to participate in economic activities and access vital 
services such as health and education.  Regional trade accounts for only one percent of the total 
merchandise trade, in part because of the poor condition of the key regional corridor in Liberia’s, Trans-
African Highway Seven (TAH7).  Therefore, improving road access is imperative to promote national 
integration and economic growth.  Despite abundant arable land and a hospitable climate for agriculture, 
Liberia faces chronic food insecurity in part because lack of road access and underdeveloped agro-logistic 
services hinder agricultural productivity and depress farm incomes. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 

5. Agriculture is the foundation of Liberia’s economy and the key to food security and poverty reduction. 
Agricultural production constitutes the most important livelihood for the average Liberian, involving more 
than 70 percent of the population. The sector accounted for 27.3 percent of real GDP in 2019 (a decline from 
38.8 percent in 2010) and 43.3 percent of total employment (down from 57.4 percent in 1995). Majority of 
farmers grow cereals/staples, including rice (64 percent) and cassava (60 percent), followed by a variety of 
vegetables, such as a peppers (50 percent), bitter balls (44 percent), okra and green leaves (30 percent). 
Most of these famers cultivate an average of 0.7 hectares under rain-fed conditions generating small 
marketable surpluses. Tree crops, especially rubber, oil palm, cocoa and coffee, make an important cash 
crops to smallholder farmers and contribute significantly to the economy. Rubber is the most important cash 
crop in Liberia and accounts for almost 65 percent of total export earnings3. But Liberia imports 50-60 
percent of its staple food requirements, making it vulnerable to global food price volatility.  
 

6. The Government of Liberia (GoL) considers agricultural growth to be critical for reducing poverty. The GoL 
has developed a five-year National Development Plan referred to as the Pro-Poor Agenda for Prosperity and 
Development (PAPD). As stated in the PAPD, the government recognizes the need for inclusive and 
sustainable economic diversification to achieve structural transformation and growth, the urgency of

facilitating private sector participation in the economy, and the importance of the agri-food sector as an 
important engine of growth. It has also prioritized the agriculture sector in their commitment to diversify 
the economy and has identified eight priority value chains requiring support under the PAPD 2018–23. These 
include rice, oil palm, horticulture, cocoa, rubber, cassava, poultry, and pig husbandry. 
 

7. Liberia’s agriculture is characterized by a diversified structure of agriculture production. Forest-based and 
tree crop farming systems cover the largest proportion of the land area in Liberia. They include tree crop-
based systems in which vegetables and other food crops are produced on a minor scale, mostly in the central 
belt of the country; root crop-based systems (with cereals) concentrated in the northern region; and fishing 
and land-based mixed cropping enterprises along the coastal belt. The three main structures of production 
are: (i) large plantations that produce major export crops such as rubber, oil palm, and to a lesser, degree 
coffee and cocoa; (ii) domestically owned, medium-sized commercial farms that cultivate industrial crops 
for export and livestock for the local market; and (iii) small household farms that use traditional production 
techniques and limited improved inputs with relatively low levels of productivity and limited access to 
markets. 
 

8. Liberia’s agriculture is characterized by low productivity. The long-lasting conflicts in Liberia have destroyed 
agricultural capital and disrupted food production, further compounding structural impediments and past 
policy failures. Since the end of hostilities, food production has increased, but smallholder yields remain low; 
e.g., in lowland rice production systems, estimated average farm paddy yield is 1.7 tons per hectare, while 
on-farm research produces up to 5 tons per hectare using improved variety and good production practices4. 
Globally, average rice yields in recent years have been at 4.2 kg/ha for paddy rice. Food value chains are also 
undeveloped, and institutions that provide advisory and support services are weak. Despite Liberia’s large 
arable land, it has been estimated that at least 15 percent of the population was severely food insecure. 

 
9. Significant challenges are limiting increased agriculture productivity and value chains development in 

Liberia. These include: (i) limited access to improved inputs and modern practices;  (ii) limited extension 
services; apart from agricultural extension provided by non-governmental organization, government 
agricultural extension services are practically non-existent5; (iii) impaired market access due to limited 
network of roads and lack of compliance with evolving market demands; (iv) weak integration of value chains 
due to insufficient aggregation of agriculture production, and lack of storage, processing, and marketing 
channels; (v) non-existent sanitary and quality controls for agricultural products; and (vi) high levels of post-
harvest losses. In addition, extremely high cost of electricity impedes the development of functioning and 
cost-efficient cold chains, which constraints competitiveness of Liberian fresh exports. Liberia will require 
critical facilities for managing sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) requirements and support to private sector 
players to improve quality management through the adoption of (and certification in) good agricultural and 
agro-industrial practices Data collected for the Enabling Business in Agriculture 2019 Report (EBA) has 
identified significant weaknesses in all areas covered by the report, and Liberia’s performance is found to be 
below the regional average in most areas, most notably in use of quality seeds, application of fertilizers, 
secure use of water, using adequate machinery, application of plant protection measures, sustainable

5 The Ministry of Agriculture has developed a plan to post one extension officer per district, but in many cases these posts are vacant due to lack of 
funding. Also, where extension officers exist, they often lack transport to make field visits.

livestock management, and access to finance.  
 

10. Liberia’s Agricultural Sector Investment Plan (LASIP II).  According to LASIP II, covering the period 2018-
2022, the current strategic long-term vision for the agricultural sector is generally to promote an inclusive 
and sustainable agricultural transformation through catalytic investment in agricultural value chains and 
industrialization and resilience to ensure food and nutrition security, environmental health, job and wealth 
creation and inclusive growth. The challenges to this agricultural transformation are:  (i) weak private sector 
and entrepreneurial skill;  (ii) inefficient production systems;  (iii) weak policy and business environment;  
(iv)  significant human resource challenges;  (v) inadequate infrastructure; (vi) insufficient agricultural 
funding;  (vii) low productivity subsistence farming;  (viii) inadequate natural resource management; and 
(ix) very limited agricultural research and development programs constraining adoption of modern practices 
and resulting in stagnant productivity. 
 

11. Poor road infrastructure has significantly hindered the growth of the agricultural sector. Farmers’ ability 
to access valuable markets and improved inputs to increase production is limited by the poor quality of the 
country’s network of roads. During the May–September rainy season, movement from rural areas is 
significantly restrained due to heavy rainfall, especially in lowland swamp areas. As a result, smallholders 
tend to sell produce in local markets where prices are relatively lower. Despite the government’s current 
initiative to rehabilitate main roadways and some key feeder roads in productive areas, more work is needed 
to improve road and bridge infrastructure in remote rural areas. In recent years the GoL promoted a 
comprehensive road network to increase country’s competitiveness including road in southeastern Liberia 
and the development of a coastal road link joining the capital, Monrovia, with Harper, capital city of 
Maryland County.  
 

12. Small and medium-size farmers trying to establish linkages with buyers have limited ability to deliver the 
required quantity and quality of produce in a timely and consistent schedule. International experience 
shows that, even in the segment of emerging commercially-oriented farmers, it has been challenging for 
them to meet the demands and requirements of buyers, including supplying consistent quantities and 
quality of goods complying with sanitary and phytosanitary standards and delivered them on time. These 
small and medium-sized farmers are less capitalized than the larger individual commercial farmers or 
producing firms/corporations, have low technology adoption and limited access to information. They are 
also lacking the equipment, infrastructure, and farm management skills to diversify into new products and 
to become reliable suppliers to buyers and industry, in a modern market with increasing demands.  Also, the 
limited size and weaknesses of their organizations creates uncertainties for the prospective buyers and 
constraints the flow of information, thus reducing possibilities for gaining access to remunerative markets.  
 

13. Access to adequate financial services, necessary for supporting investments and increasing farm 
productivity and agribusiness competitiveness, are quite limited. The small number of financial institutions 
provide a limited array of products and services to the agri-food sector (credit extended to agricultural sector 
is estimated at 5.4 percent of total lending in the economy).  Financing for agriculture is mainly limited to 
export crops such as rubber and cocoa, for which foreign investors provide finance for plantation 
development and donor-supported projects channel small amounts of financing through financial

institutions.  The main obstacles for small and medium size farmers, are:  (i) unsecure land tenure and limited 
availability of collateral due to absence of other forms of capital accepted as collateral (ii) low levels of 
financial literacy and credit background; (iii) common perception in the financial sector that agricultural is 
too risky and returns are uncertain; (iv) small farm size and low level of organization do not ensure adequate 
volume of supply with consistent quality; (v) limited experience by financial agencies in lending to the sector; 
(vi) financial intermediaries normally lend at short-term and are reluctant to lend for medium- and long-
term investments. 
 

14. Women are major players in the agriculture sector, although facing substantial gender inequalities. They 
comprise approximately 60 percent of the rural agricultural labor force and carry out 80 percent of 
agricultural activities throughout the planting season, including land clearing, planting, harvesting, and 
marketing. Although they play a dominant role in agricultural production, few women are able to own land, 
access loans, or control the income they earn from their labor. Moreover, women have less access to 
productive inputs than men, including skills training, basic tools, and technology. Women’s workloads are 
also increased during less productive periods, when many men migrate to seek work in mines, plantations, 
and urban areas, leaving women to care for their families and farms.  
 

15. Climate change and shifting cultivation are the most significant environmental threats in Liberia. Liberia’s 
susceptibility to negative climate impacts has significantly increased due to a combination of low agriculture 
productivity, climate vulnerability risks, population pressure and unsustainable natural resource 
management. According to data of the climate change vulnerability index, Liberia is among the top 20 most 
vulnerable countries in Africa. Major climate related changes including an average temperature rise (1-2 
degrees Celsius), modified rainfall patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events (such as flooding 
and drought) are predicted to occur over the next decades. These changes may result in heat stress, 
reduction of food crops and fodder crop production both in quality and quantity, and higher susceptibility 
to pests and diseases. Given the climate sensitivities of multiple engines of growth, agriculture, natural 
capital, and infrastructure, the urgency for Liberia to ramp up climate-smart development at scale and across 
the growth spectrum is an imperative. Moreover, due to the availability of land and forests, farmers tend to 
shift cultivation to new plots annually to increase production rather than implementing improved 
agricultural management techniques, which contributes to deforestation.  Low income populations struggle 
more than others to cope with and adapt to climate change and natural hazards, increasing their risk to fall 
deeper into poverty. 
 

16. GoL recognizes that transformation is required in the food and agriculture sector to maximize its 
contribution to economic growth and poverty reduction. Within the framework of its Pro-Poor Agenda for 
Prosperity and Development, the GoL is focusing on three fundamental issues: (i) improved national food 
and nutrition security with the objective to increase food availability and production in order to spur local 
economic development and food security; (ii) enhanced agricultural productivity, competitiveness, and 
linkages to markets; focusing on strengthening efficiency, promoting innovation, fostering sustainability, 
and leveraging opportunities in national and external markets; broadening and strengthen private sector 
participation; increasing public investments (mainly in rural infrastructure); and creating an enabling 
macroeconomic environment; and (iii) strengthened human and institutional capacities with the thrust to

establish effective and efficient public sector frameworks in agricultural planning and coordination; reduce 
risks and improve coping mechanisms; mainstream gender and youth in agriculture and rural development 
and ensure sustainable use of natural resources. 
 

17. The proposed Rural Economic Transformation Project (RETRAP) supports the GoL Pro-Poor Agenda for 
Prosperity and Development and the MoA three-year strategy plan for the Agriculture sector with a focus 
on: (i) institutional development and the promotion of inclusive and competitive value chains (cassava, 
rubber, poultry, and piggery). It also supports the GoL achieve its commitments under the Comprehensive 
African Agricultural Development Program (CAADP), which commits the country’s government to investing 
more in the agriculture sector. 

 
Relationship to CPF 

 

18. Country Partnership Framework (CPF) Pillars.  The proposed Project is in consonant with the three pillars 
of the CPF (FY19-FY24) for Liberia, including (i) strengthening institutions and creating an enabling 
environment for inclusive and sustainable growth; (ii) building human capital to seize new economic 
opportunities; and (iii) narrowing the infrastructure gap to foster more equitable nationwide development. 
It is also contributing to achieving the country’s UN Sustainable Development Goals, in particular Goal 1 (End 
poverty in all its forms everywhere), Goal 2 (End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and 
promote sustainable agriculture); Goal 9 (Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, 
including regional and trans-border infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-
being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all); and Goal 13 (Take urgent action to combat 
climate change and its impact: by enhancing productivity that implies the efficient use of inputs, including 
water and land; enhancing awareness and promoting climate smart agriculture measures).  
 

19. The proposed project supports IDA19 policy priorities (Gender, Climate, Governance, Jobs, FCV). The 
project will support the following key agendas: (i) Economic transformation and job creation: by supporting 
sustained increases in agricultural productivity and a shift to commercial enterprises, the strengthening of 
efficient value chains and the development of a thriving rural economy which will in turn create quality 
employment in upstream and downstream activities servicing agriculture; (ii) resilience building and food 
security: by enhancing resilience of domestic agricultural production systems through the promotion of 
climate smart technologies6; and (iv) Gender inclusion: by helping removing the constraints in access and 
ownership of productive resources faced by women as well as support their access to information, financial 
services and technologies (for production, processing and marketing).  

 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
The project development objective (PDO) is to improve agriculture productivity and access to markets for selected  
value chains in the Project targeted areas. 

 
6 The project will also contribute to the WBG’s Africa Climate Change Business Plan and to reaching CIV’s climate change mitigation and adaptation targets articulated 
in the Intended National Determined Contribution (INDC).

D. Concept Description 

 

21. The project addresses important challenges to developing agri-food value chains in Liberia. 
These include:  (i) weak capacity of support institutions for delivery of agribusiness services; (ii) poor 
organization of smallholder farmers; (ii) low agriculture productivity due to limited access to 
improved technologies, modern inputs, and advisory services; (iii) weak access to markets due to 
inadequate post-harvest, transport, and marketing infrastructure; and (iv) limited private sector 
investment in production, processing capacity and value-added activities.  To address these 
challenges, the project will contribute to creating long-term economic opportunities for value chain 
actors by applying a three-fold approach: (i) strengthen critical institutions overseeing the 
development of the sector; (ii) intervene at various level of the supply chain via capacity building 
and investment subprojects focused on improving agriculture productivity and resilience of the food 
system to climate change, thus enhancing market access; and (iii) improvement of rural access and 
agricultural marketing through the upgrading of roads, construction of short-span critical cross-
drainage structures, and improvement of agro-logistics centers.  
 

22. Targeted priority value chains. Cassava, rubber, poultry, piggery and vegetable value chains where 
selected for Project support.  These value chains will complement the value chains which are already 
supported under the World Bank-funded Smallholder Agriculture Transformation and Agribusiness 
Revitalization Project (STAR-P – P160945): rice, oil palm, and horticulture. The selection was based on two 
sector scans7, 8  which assessed a range of development impact criteria; including: (i) evidence-based 
market demand for selected commodities; (ii) high growth potential, demonstrated by positive 
growth trends of the value chains, scope for expanding production and increasing sales, and scope 
for value addition through processing; (iii) potential for poverty reduction9; and (iv) project-related 
aspects, including existing infrastructure and complementarities with other projects in the country.

Vegetables production (home gardens) will also be supported because of its importance in 
generating incomes for women and for nutrition diversification at the household level (See Annex 1 for 
further details). 
 

23. Geographical focus and phased approach. The Project is expected to operate in 10 out of the 15 Counties 
of Liberia (see Annex 2): (i) Group 1: covering the Bong, Lofa, Nimba, Grand Bassa, Bomi, Grand Cape Mount, 
Grand Gedeh and Maryland counties, which offer comparative advantage for the production of cassava; (ii) 
Group 2: covering the Counties of Montserrado, Nimba, Bong, Margibi, Bomi, Sinoe and Maryland counties, 
with advantages for rubber production;  (iii) Group 3:  covering the Regions of Grand Cape Mount, Bomi, 
Montserrado, Bong and Margibi for poultry/piggery production.  The Project would give priority to counties 
where farmers organizations already exist, and where there are market opportunities (processing factories, 
close to urban areas, border-outlets, etc.), before moving to counties without any existing farmers 
organizations. The final selection of the project’s intervention location for the selected value chains will be 
determined during project preparation in consultation with key value chain stakeholders.  
 

24. The project builds on the design features of the Smallholder Agriculture Transformation and Agribusiness 
Revitalization Project (STAR-P, P160945). The proposed project builds on the experience gained under the 
STAR-P Project, expanding the “Productive Alliance” approach to promote new selected value chains. This 
approach support producer organizations by bringing together: (i) a group of  farmers producing a particular 
product; (ii) one or more (potential) buyers for that product; and (iii) other partners involved along the value 
chain providing services or undertaking some processing required by the final buyer/s (e.g., aggregation, 
handling, storage, processing). These entities, or participating members of the “alliance” are connected 
through a business proposition, or “business plan”, which assesses the capital and service needs of the 
producer association, and proposes improvements that would allow them to upgrade their production 
capacities and skills to strengthen their linkage with the markets.  The public sector is normally engaged in 
providing an enabling environment and, in many occasions, supporting the participating member preparing 
investment proposals, as well as providing adequate financing for implementing the proposal. Global 
experience has shown that the approach help solving multiple constraints by providing integrated solutions 
adapted to local conditions and explores the existence of significant motivations perceived by partners in 
the alliance and significantly contributes to increasing stability in prices, assured sales, as well as 
improvements in product quality and, hence, have resulted in increased revenues.   
 

25. In addressing identified value chain constraints and in partnership with IFC, the Project will include a 
spectrum of actions for Maximizing Finance for Development (MFD). These actions, to be further 
developed during preparation, may include: (i) increasing the space for private sector activity; (ii) improving 
the policy and regulatory environment; for instance through establishing partnerships between operators 
within the value chains, and improving farmers – buyers contractual arrangements; (ii) facilitating access to 
finance for agribusiness development (provision of matching grants) and supporting agri-entrepreneurs to 
develop “bankable” and viable business plans;  (iii) supporting essential public goods and services such as 
strengthening human capital, agricultural research/extension services, and public infrastructure (roads and 
market information) contributing to enhance market access; and (iv) technical assistance to financial 
institutions to strengthen their capacity for diversifying their financial products and expanding their 
outreach, as well as to address the lack of financial literacy in the group of potential beneficiaries.

26. Scaling-up and disseminate innovative agricultural technologies:  Farmers’ access to localized, relevant and 

timely information on crop management and market intelligence is critical to achieve project objective. In 
this context, mobile-based rural advisory services (RAS), has potential to drive greater productivity gains 
than traditional methods of extension and reduce information asymmetry on market prices etc. The project 
will identify and assess existing examples10 of relevant modern and innovative solutions implemented in the 
country and provide financial support to customize such products for the project-supported producer 
organizations.  

 
27. The Project will also focus on other cross-cutting priorities.  These are; especially: (i) taking gender issues 

and empowerment of vulnerable groups (women and youth) into account in the context of broad  social 
safeguards measures (ii) promoting mitigation and adaptation to climate change and adherence to 
environmental sound actions as well as giving priority to climate smart technologies enhancing resilience; 
and (iii) promoting inclusion of products for improving nutrition at household level; and (iv) giving priority 
to adoption of technologies reducing GHG emissions. The project will set targets for participation by women 
and youth and will prioritize subprojects that have the potential to generate full-time rural employment 
opportunities. When selecting subprojects for investment, the project will mainstream resilient and low 
carbon activities to help address agricultural vulnerability and reduce agricultural emissions of greenhouse 
gases (GHGs). The project will also promote climate-smart agriculture (CSA) approaches as well as best 
practices and technologies for water resource management to improve climate resilience. With regards to 
nutrition, the project will promote home gardening and simultaneously support the dissemination of 
information on sound nutritional practices among beneficiaries, particularly for women and children.  

 
 

1. Description 
 
Project Components 

 

28. Component 1: Improving the enabling environment, enhancing support services for agribusiness 
development and strengthening producer organizations (IDA US$3.5 million). The objective of Component 
1 is to improve the enabling policy and regulatory environment necessary for private businesses to increase 
investment and commercial activities and enhancing delivery of quality support services that can foster an 
inclusive and competitive development of this sector. The project will invest in development and 
maintenance of an Integrated Agriculture Business Information and Intelligence Information System (IABIIS) 
to improve service delivery capabilities of MoA.  At the same time, the project will be supporting farmers in 
the formation of producer organizations (in areas where they are not present and assessed as feasible), as 
well as in developing their skills in technical, administrative/managerial and marketing activities. The

component will finance combinations of specialized technical assistance, training, works, goods, consulting 
and non-consulting services, and operational expenses, as detailed below.  
 

30. Subcomponent 1.1: Improving public agribusiness services. This intervention aims at enhancing the 
capacity of selected public services that are critical for enabling agribusiness; principally, Ministry of 
Agriculture (MoA), Cooperative Development Agency (CDA), Central Agricultural Research Institute (CARI), 
Soil and Crop laboratory, and the National Standard Laboratory (NSL, with national responsibility for testing 
food quality). The project will undertake a functional review of these entities and recommend solutions for 
improving the quality of their services. The focus will be on strategies and solutions for enhanced growth 
and entrepreneurship in the agribusiness sector; formulating interactive and demand driven knowledge, 
innovation and extension system with a focus on climate-smart technologies; promotion of investments in 
the sector (encouraging women and youth entrepreneurship); enhanced governance and partnerships 
across the value chains, and management of agribusiness development programs/projects. In principle, it 
will also support MoA to operationalize the sector’s approved acts on seeds, food safety, pesticide, fertilizer 
and the national rice development strategy, updating and enforcement of standards in the agriculture 
sector; this will include the provision of technical assistance, training, and equipment; and (ii) establishing 
an agriculture database to support monitoring, research, policy-making and allocation of resources by 
counties. The system shall ensure that farmers, allied institutions of MoA (such as CARI, NSL) and private 
sector partners have a shared platform for data access, knowledge sharing and to avail advisory/financial 
benefits. The component will finance system design and maintenance, purchase of IT infrastructure, on-
boarding of competent human resources and requisite IT service providers.  
 

31. Subcomponent 1.2: Enhancing value chain coordination and public-private dialogue-(PPD). The Project 
will: (i) conduct a stakeholder mapping exercise as the basis to put in place a representative and inclusive 
Private Public Dialogue (PPD) mechanism; (ii) support the establishment and operation of this mechanism, 
including training of main stakeholders on its effective use to improve the performance of targeted value 
chains; and (iii) support increased consultations among the value chain stakeholders (especially women), 
through  regular forums to discuss the various constraints of the sector, review and update the government 
sector strategy, develop a shared vision and harmonized approach to minimize potential conflict, 
mainstream climate change in the programs, devise mechanisms for coordinating donor assistance and 
creating an enabling environment for private and public investments. It will also support establishing an 
Agribusiness Growth Delivery Unit (AGDU) as an agribusiness strategy incubator and strategic advisory arm 
of MoA.  
 

32. Subcomponent 1.3:  Strengthening Producer Organizations.  This subcomponent will address the need to 
enhance capacities of targeted Farmers-Based Organizations (FBOs) to be able to address critical limiting 
factors to facilitate effective access to markets and sustainable integration with formal and lucrative value 
chains and providing support for taking advantage of investment opportunities. It will comprise financing of 
technical assistance, training and capacity building of beneficiaries and their organizations, as well as 
services for facilitating complementary services (financial, specialized technical assistance, inputs, 
certification services, etc.).  Assistance will cover assistance to establish new organizations in areas where

they are absent (but it is feasible and there are clear competitive advantages) and legal assistance to their 
formal registration. 
 

33. Component 2: Enhancing Competitiveness and Market Access through Productive Alliances (IDA US$15 
million). The objective of this component is to promote the development of organizations of small and 
medium-sized agricultural producers participating in “productive alliances” with selected partners with the 
aim to be able to operate competitively in selected value chains, with strengthened and more reliable 
linkages with buyers and markets and increased capacity to manage climate risks. The basic approach is to 
promote investments and collective actions, with the aim of gaining economies of scale, enhancing 
bargaining power, facilitating knowledge sharing, and reducing costs of production and service delivery.  The 
activities included in these subprojects could comprise eligible works, goods, and services required by 
different partners participating in the subproject to achieve measurable targets in terms of product/service 
specifications (such as quality, quantity, and delivery conditions) agreed with their respective prospective 
buyer or customers, within the framework of a joint business plan. 
 

34. Subcomponent 2.1:  Pre-Investment Activities.  This subcomponent will support pre-investment activities 
to: (i) promote the project concept and increase outreach to potential FBO beneficiaries, commercial 
partners, and private financing entities, as well as identify productive alliances among FBOs and commercial 
partners; (ii) identify potential business opportunities on the part of the productive alliance; (iii) prepare 
business plans and proposals for Investment Subprojects reflecting the identified opportunity; (iv) build 
capacity among technical service providers to enhance the quality of the services provided to the productive 
alliances;  (v) support project-related studies to promote specific, prioritized value chains and evaluate the 
potential for business plan investments to contribute to climate change mitigation and resilience and to the 
economic inclusion of otherwise marginalized groups.  These investment initiatives (Subproject proposals) 
will be demand-driven and with clearly demonstrated benefits.  Facilitators and Community Development 
Officers (CDOs) will be engaged for a maximum of 2 years of the project period to facilitate the preparation 
of Subproject proposals for farmers’ groups and their participating partners. Capacity building will be 
provided for Facilitators, Services Providers, Farmers Groups and other Producer Associations. 
 

35. Subcomponent 2.2:  Investment Subprojects Supporting Productive Alliances.  This subcomponent will 
provide technical and financial support (matching grants) for the implementation of technically feasible, 
financially viable, economically profitable, socially responsible, climate resilient and environmentally 
sustainable investment Subprojects, which will help producing a consistent and timely supply of quality 
produce to buyers, while helping to provide a reliable income to allied producers organizations and their 
partners participating in the “alliance”. The implementation of these investment subprojects will make 
possible sustainable increases in productivity and improvements in quality of the products offered in 
accordance to market demands.  The Subprojects will be prepared in a participatory fashion with support 
by the Project together with the potential beneficiaries (farmer organizations and their allied partners, such 
as aggregators, processors, technical service providers, lenders, etc.).  Sub-projects with a clear impact on 
agricultural production resilience, using climate-smart technologies e.g. zero tillage, the use of soil and water 
conservation techniques such as tied-ridging, and of integrated soil fertility management options such as 
composting, and efficient use of mineral fertilizers would be particularly targeted and prioritized.

36. Eligible expenditure under these Subprojects include: (i) civil works (for example, lowland rehabilitation; 

clearing of bushland; construction of post-harvest, storage, and processing facilities; and small-scale, 
efficient irrigation systems); (ii) goods, such as productive equipment (for example, farm machinery, 
processing equipment, storage units, and transport vehicles); (iii) incremental working capital (for example, 
for improved inputs); (iv) technical assistance and business advisory services supporting the implementation 
of the subprojects and enhancing organizations’ administrative and managerial capacities.  Investment 
proposals by farmers’ organizations and agribusinesses that integrate climate-smart approaches throughout 
the value chain, such as intercropping and conservation agriculture (which will increase crop diversification); 
use of climate-resilient seeds and varieties; methods to retain soil nutrients and prevent soil erosion; 
improved water management for extreme warm weather; flood-resilient design of production; and efficient 
pest and disease management; alternative sources of energy;  water and wastage re-use systems, saving 
energy of implementing mitigating approaches reduce GHG emissions, will receive priority and may qualify 
for additional bonus financing. 

 
37. These Investment Subprojects will qualify for receiving matching grant through three dedicated windows to 

support the development of value chains in selected commodities and supporting different types of 
beneficiaries, but all integrated into a single Subproject.  The matching grant from the Project will cover a 
part of the overall cost of implementing the Subproject, making necessary for the beneficiaries to come up 
with their counterpart contribution (in cash).  The level of required counterpart financing will depend on the 
type of beneficiary and the amount of the investment to be undertaken (ranges will be fully determined 
during preparation and included in detail in the Project Operational Manual).  These windows are: 

 
(a)  Window A, which will support to smallholder farmers organizations, targeting organized smallholder 

farmers organizations that are eligible to receive matching grant funds as co-financing.  In areas where 
the targeted beneficiaries are not organized, jointly with the Ministry of Agriculture, other government 
agencies and NGOs active in project areas, the project will support the formation of producer and agro-
based organizations.  The main beneficiaries of this window are small producers and other organized 
vulnerable groups, such as women entrepreneurs and women-led producer organizations and youth, 
who will be encouraged to participate through a targeted information campaign. 

(b) Window B, supporting commercially oriented farmers that are also service providers.  This window will 
contribute directly to boost agricultural production that will ensure there is a reliable supply of produce 
along the supply chain.  Priority will be given to those commercially oriented farmers that (a) work with 
smallholder farmers by transferring new technologies and provision of technical assistance; (b) adapt 
technologies that address binding constraints and risks in agriculture, such as climate change; (c) create 
formal partnership with value chains to ensure access to markets and research organizations to ensure 
the transfer of new technologies; (d) create jobs; and (e) contribute to food security.   In cases where it 
is not possible to work with organized farmers, these larger commercially-oriented farmer or service 
providers may be the vehicle to channel funding for investments to be made at the producing level, as 
well as to channel the technical assistance and the improved inputs. 

(c) Window C, supporting all other partners or participating members of an alliance (integrated in a single 
Subproject), such as private business and enterprises providing any aggregation, processing or service

that is essential to the success of the Subproject according to the demands of the buyer/s and, at the 
same time, requiring a new investment to adapt its operations in order to comply with the buyer/s 
demands. 
 

38. Component 3: Agro-logistics and Infrastructure Investments (IDA US$31.5 million). The objective of this 
component is to improve access to markets through the rehabilitation of existing roads, construction of 
short-span critical cross-drainage structures, and improvement of agro-logistics centers. Expected outcomes 
from such investments are improved quality of products and reduced post-harvest losses, reduced 
marketing costs and better connection between producers and buyers, and improved competitiveness of 
the domestic production in supplying of food products to major consumption centers and export points. 

 
39. Subcomponent 3.1: Roads.  Complementing the planned road works works financed as part of  the South 

Eastern Corridor Road Asset Management Project (SECRAMP; P149279) under which a total of 100km length 
of road between Ganta and Tappita is to be rehabilitated, the Project will support the rehabilitation of 40 
km section of the 112 km long Tappita - Zwedru road11. The project will use Output- and Performance-Based 
Road Contracts (OPRC) under Design, Build and Transfer (DBT) methodology and will also finance the 
associated consultant services.  According to a conceptual design carried out, the proposed design includes 
a full construction of the road to a two-lane carriageway with bituminous surfacing along the existing right-
of-way, with a 20-year design life.  The conceptual design study anticipates reduced vehicle operating costs 
and reliable year-round access resulting in significant increases in additional traffic generated. As part of the 
road design, the project will also incentivize contractors to choose materials and implement processes that 
generate less emissions, adopt engineering and structural measures and bioengineering involving the use of 
vegetation either alone or in conjunction with other civil engineering structures. Once rehabilitated, it is 
expected that the road will play a key role in improving market access for farmers, businesses, traders and 
agro-processors and transport service companies and unlocking the agricultural potential of the entire 
south-eastern region. 
 

40. Subcomponent 3.2: Agro-logistics.  With regards agro-logistics interventions, the project will facilitate the 
preparation of a national agro-logistics program to outline the policy framework and identify the main 
infrastructure networks required to enable proper transport and distribution of agricultural/agro-industrial 
products. It will also finance investments including: (i) construction of a number of open market sheds and 
small storage facilities; (ii) construction of selected infrastructure that require specialized handling agri-
produce; and (iii) construction of market internal path-ways, drainage infrastructure, toilets and clean water 
facilities. The infrastructure to be rehabilitated or established under the Project would incorporate design 
standards ensuring their resilience to the main local risk factors (geophysical conditions and climate change) 
and their potential for climate co-benefits (e.g. improved energy efficiency, use of renewable energy, etc.). 
Detailed locations of these infrastructures and their operation and management would be identified and 
discussed during project preparation. 

 

 
11 Currently, the Ganta -Tappita stretch, almost halfway to Zwedru, is under financing from from GoL, World Bank and Liberia Reconstruction Trust 
Fund (LRTF) sources (Ganta-Saglepie, 39km financed by GOL, and Saglepie-Tappita, 61km financed by WB/LRTF) under the South Eastern Corridor 
Road Asset Management Project (SECRAMP).  The AfDB is also financing the paving of the stretch from Zwedru to the Ivorian Border in the South. A 
gap of about 85km is still under discussion for financing by donors in the next round of allocations.

41. Component 4: Project coordination and Management (IDA US$5 million). The aim of this component is 
twofold: (i) ensuring that GoL is better equipped to respond to crises and emergencies; and (ii) establishing 
appropriate coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), and communication regarding Project 
implementation. The Project will finance the creation and operation of a National Coordination Office (NCO) 
within MoA, through provision of appropriate staffing and operating resources. The NCO will be responsible 
for: (i) ensuring effective planning, implementation and monitoring of the Project activities; (ii) fiduciary 
management and environmental and social safeguard compliance; (iii) effective coordination with 
participating stakeholders and partners; (iii) evaluating the Project’s final results, outcomes, and impacts on 
value chain actors; and (iv) ensuring efficient knowledge management and effective communication on 
project activities. 
 

42. Component 5: Contingency Emergency Response Component – CERC (IDA: US$0.0 million). The objective 
of this component is to provide immediate response to an Eligible Crisis or Emergency, as may be presented 
in the future. The CERC is one of the Bank’s contingent financing mechanisms available to Borrowers to gain 
rapid access to Bank financing to respond to a crisis or emergency. It is included as a Project component that 
is designed to provide swift response in the event of an eligible crisis or emergency, defined as “an event 
that has caused, or is likely to imminently cause, a major adverse economic and/or social impact associated 
with natural or man-made crises or disasters.” The mechanism for the triggering of the CERC will be included 
in the Credit Agreement, which will require (inter-alia), the preparation of a CERC Manual detailing the 
applicable fiduciary, environmental and social, monitoring, reporting, and any other implementation 
arrangements necessary.  Provided the World Bank Group agrees with the emergency assessment, this 
component would allow the government to request the World Bank to reallocate uncommitted resources 
from other project components to this component in order to cover emergency response and recovery costs 
or, eventually, to channel additional financing that may become available because of the emergency.

Summary of Screening of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts 
.  
 
 
 

Environmental Risk Rating 
 
The environmental risk rating for the proposed project is substantial. The classification is based on the potential 
environmental risks and impacts, the sensitivity of the recipient environment and the capacity of the implementing 
agencies to manage the risks. The project’s adverse environmental risks and impacts will mainly emanate from 
interventions under Components 2 and 3. The Matching Grant (MG) scheme under Component 2 might trigger 
agricultural commercialization, expansion of farmlands, expansion and/or renovation of agricultural infrastructure such

as warehouses, processing facilities, electricity connectivity etc. Land clearing associated with farming and provision of 
infrastructure could contribute to deforestation, forest degradation, destruction of natural habitats, soil erosion and 
depletion of biodiversity. Agricultural intensification could trigger extensive use of pesticides with adverse repercussions 
on human health and biodiversity. The proposed support to poultry and piggery industry will produce animal waste 
(manure) which could contaminate ground and surface water as well as contribute to green-house gas emissions if 
poorly managed. Similarly, effluents from processing facilities e.g. cassava processing under the MG scheme could 
contribute to water contamination, eutrophication and unsightly scenes in communities. The risks associated with 
surface water contamination from pesticides and effluents from processing facilities could transcend communities and 
may have far reaching consequences, if not properly managed. These potential risks will be further assessed along with 
appropriate mitigation measures in the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) to be prepared for 
the project prior to appraisal. The proposed road improvement of 40 km under Component 3 might result in 
environmental, occupational, and community health and safety risks. The risks and impacts will generally range from 
minor to substantial but mainly localized. The Ministry of Agriculture will implement the project in collaboration with 
other ministries. Environmental safeguard capacity varies among ministries with no experience in the implementation of 
the ESS.  
 
Social Risk Rating 
 
The social risk rating for the proposed project is substantial. The classification is based on the potential project social risks 
and impacts, the country context social sensitivity issues and the capacity of the implementing agencies to manage the 
risks. The project social risks include risk of conflicts within communities, agribusiness service providers and project if 
selection of beneficiaries is not transparent. Risk of exclusion of poor households and vulnerable groups and elite capture 
of project benefits (e.g. the Matching Grants, provision of farm inputs, access to information on crop management and 
market intelligence), poses substantial risk. Similarly, risks and impacts associated with temporary and permanent land 
acquisition for rural agribusiness infrastructure (e.g. warehousing, processing facilities etc.) and road rehabilitation are 
anticipated. In particular, economic or physical displacement is anticipated under the proposed rehabilitation of a 40km 
section of the 112km long Tappita - Zwedru Road. Other social risks include potential legacy issues related to impacts of 
previous road construction activities on Project Affected People (PAP) and communities along the proposed road corridor 
to be rehabilitated. While use of local labor is anticipated, use of migrant workers and risk of use of child labor and/ or 
forced labor cannot be ignored. The risk of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse and Sexual Harassments (SEA/SH) is possible 
given the country context and social sensitivity issues and focus of project interventions in rural areas with possibility of 
men and women working in unsupervised conditions. Risks of spread of communicable diseases including spread of 
COVID-19 are anticipated given the project interventions will be implemented in counties where potential for spread of 
infectious diseases cannot be ignored.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 
Agriculture remains central to the livelihoods of millions of Africans, yet far too many agriculture-dependent Africans 
remain food insecure and malnourished. After a period of moderate improvement, food security throughout the region 
has recently deteriorated. Slowdowns in productivity growth, combined with increasingly frequent food production 
failures, point to the need to significantly raise the bar when it comes to increasing the productive capacity and 
strengthening the resilience of rural households. The economic hardship resulting from the COVID-19 crisis are expected 
to further worsen food insecurity in the region, making resilience-building an even more urgent task. 

The livelihoods of African farmers and livestock keepers, long known to be vulnerable to the vicissitudes of weather, are 
being severely impacted by climate change. Climate-related shocks to food production have increased in frequency from 
occurring once every 12.5 years to occurring once every 2.5 years. The increased frequency of climate-induced production 
shocks have made it increasingly difficult to maintain positive growth in per capita food production over the longer term.   

Climate change is projected to further increase the number of drought days in Africa and shorten growing seasons. 
Droughts, floods, and tropical storms are the climatic events that affect food production the most. Substantial increases 
in these major drivers of crop and livestock production shortfalls are projected for large parts of Africa. This at a time when 
the number of people to feed will almost double by 2050 to over 2 billion―a population that will be increasingly urbanized. 

Climate change poses a serious threat to crop productivity in sub-regions within Africa that are already food insecure. The 
impact is projected to be highest in maize, millet, sorghum, and wheat. Climate change will also affect productivity in 
Africa’s livestock sector. Depending on the location and prevailing production systems, water scarcity will lower the 
productivity of pastures, reduce yields of milk and meat, and increase the incidence of diseases. All this will translate into 
a significant deterioration in food security, if no action is taken. 

Agriculture is an important livelihood source for women throughout sub-Saharan Africa and an important source of 
employment. Studies consistently show that in most parts of sub-Saharan Africa, productivity of women farmers 
consistently lags behind that of men farmers. The sources of the productivity gap have been amply documented including 
land, improved technologies, lesser access to inputs, credit, insurance, and advisory services. They are thus generally less 
well-resourced, and hence more vulnerable to shocks that negatively impact farming and livestock keeping activities.  

Women farmers are especially vulnerable to climate change impacts, due to household responsibilities as well as increased 
agricultural work from male out-migration. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) options have the potential to provide benefits 
for women; when they have access to information on CSA, they are just as likely as men to adopt the practices. Women 
can be important agents of innovation, including in response to climate change, and ensuring that women beneficiaries

of the project are able to avail of CSA technologies and climate information will be a focus of the project’s gender strategy.  

The ambition of many African governments to improve food security, nationally and at household level, is in danger of not 
being met. The 2014 Malabo Declaration set ambitious 2025 targets to end hunger, double agricultural productivity, halve 
post-harvest losses, and sustain agricultural GDP growth of at least 6 percent per year. The region is not on track to meet 
these targets, and it will be difficult to make sustained progress in the face of large climate-induced production shocks.  

Strengthening the productivity and resilience of African agriculture will depend critically on the ability of governments and 
their partners to bring science and innovation to the forefront of the development agenda. Urgent action is needed to 
improve climate adaptation of Africa’s food systems. Incentives, knowledge, science, and finance will all need to play a 
role, together with increased co-ordination among development partners to improve the climate resilience of production 
systems, build efficient value chains, facilitate internal and external trade, and boost the purchasing power of the most 
vulnerable households. As countries contemplate a shift towards climate-smart investments, investing in agricultural 
research is more critical than ever. The high returns to investment in agricultural research and innovation are well 
documented, and a large body of evidence shows that such investment is very effective at reducing poverty and hunger. 

In recognition of the critical role played by science and innovation in enabling the adaptation of African agriculture to 
climate change, the World Bank recently announced an increase in support to CGIAR. At the Climate Action Summit that 
took place during the UN General Assembly held in September 2019, President Malpass announced an increase in support 
to CGIAR. While the CGIAR system has in the past received direct grants from the World Bank, the unprecedented decision 
to use IDA financing to support CGIAR reflects the World Bank’s strong commitment to step up support to CGIAR despite 
a constrained budget environment. The incremental financing presents a unique opportunity to support critical CGIAR 
work being done for the benefit of millions of poor households in IDA countries whose livelihoods depend on agriculture.   

The World Bank’s increased support for CGIAR comes at a critical time, when the COVID-19 pandemic is further 
threatening food security throughout the region and undermining the livelihoods of millions of agriculture-dependent 
households. Going forward, efforts will be needed to increase domestic food production throughout the region and make 
food supply chains more resilient to the threat of pandemics, by promoting innovation and building additional capacity to 
manage pests and diseases while monitoring the health and safety of food. CGIAR will be at the forefront of these efforts. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 
CGIAR is the world leader in international agriculture research on climate change adaptation. With a budget of around 
US$1 billion, CGIAR operates at a scale that when combined with the investments made by its many partners is having a 
measurable impact on climate adaptation efforts worldwide. CGIAR specializes in “translational research,” adapting 
knowledge produced through basic research so it can be applied in specific contexts. CGIAR does this by partnering with 
regional organizations, national research institutions, civil society organizations, and private firms and individuals.  

CGIAR can play a vital catalytic role in strengthening the agriculture research architecture in Africa, if the “missing middle” 
can be filled. At present, regional and national programs in Africa have difficulty engaging with CGIAR in a systematic way, 
and what is happening now is often done in an ad hoc manner. A major obstacle is the absence of resources to support 
interactions between CGIAR Centers on the one hand (funded mainly by international donors) and regional and national 
programs on the other hand (funded mainly by African governments). New sources of flexible funding are needed to 
facilitate the engagement between CGIAR and regional and national programs in Africa.  

The CGIAR Research Program (CRP) on Climate Change, Agriculture, and Food Security (CCAFS) is at the forefront of 
fostering climate adaptation in agriculture and food systems. The over-arching objectives of CCAFS are: (i) to identify and 
test pro-poor climate change adaptation and mitigation practices, technologies and policies for food systems, adaptive 
capacity and rural livelihoods; and (ii) to provide diagnosis and analysis that will ensure cost effective investments, the

inclusion of agriculture in climate change policies, and the inclusion of climate issues in agricultural policies, from the sub-
national to the global level in a way that brings benefits to the rural poor.  

CCAFS is being implemented by a consortium of CGIAR and non-CGIAR partners, under the leadership of the International 
Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), an international agricultural research center within the CGIAR system with the 
mandate to carry out research on problems of tropical agriculture for the benefit of developing countries. CCAFS work is 
led by staff at CGIAR Centers and at six partner universities, including: (1) Leeds University, (2) Columbia University, (3) 
University of Vermont, (4) University of Oxford, (5) Utrecht University, and (6) Wageningen University.  

CCAFS activities are focused on enhancing climate resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, but the level of funding is inadequate. 
During 2017-2019, nearly one-half (48 percent) of the total CCAFS budget of $160 million went to support work in Africa, 
including 26 percent allocated to CCAFS programs in West Africa and 22 percent allocated to CCAFS programs in East 
Africa. CCAFS has an approved expenditure framework, but shortfalls in expected donor financing have resulted in 
significant funding gaps that threaten the achievement of some critical results. Moreover, since CCAFS was approved in 
2018, new evidence has emerged (for example, IPCC’s 2019 1.5 degree assessment report) that makes clear that the level 
of ambition to promote climate adaptation must increase dramatically. 

AICCRA will support CCAFS programs and activities that are targeted specifically to Africa and will help take to scale the 
most strategic and impactful CCAFS-Africa programs, promoting resilience to climate change and improved food security 
in the region. AICCRA will fill a critical gap by making cutting-edge CGIAR research and innovation available to NARS and 
other key stakeholders in Africa. It will support knowledge creation and capacity building activities to enable regional and 
national-level stakeholders to take CSA innovations to scale. It will achieve that by fostering partnerships between CGIAR 
and local research institutes, universities, civil society organizations, farmer organizations, and private sector. AICCRA will 
facilitate the development of Climate Information Services (CIS) and promote the adoption of CSA solutions across sub-
regions within Africa that are extremely vulnerable to climate change. The project will also support on-the-ground 
activities in selected countries in Western, Eastern and Southern Africa where CGIAR science has the greatest chance of 
success in delivering catalytic results, which can be adopted by other countries in the region. 

 
Relationship to CPF 

 
AICCRA is well aligned with World Bank regional strategies. AICCRA will support the World Bank Africa Regional Integration 
and Cooperation Assistance Strategy (2018). It will contribute to the World Bank Group Strategy for Fragility, Conflict and 
Violence 2020–2025, as well as to the World Bank Group Adaptation and Resilience Action Plan (2018) and the World Bank 
Africa Climate Business Plan (2018) and New Generation Climate Business Plan (under preparation). In addition, it will 
contribute to the activities proposed under World Bank Country Partnership Frameworks for many countries being served 
in Africa by CCAFS.  

AICCRA will build upon the achievements of past and current engagements by the World Bank in Africa. The design of 
AICCRA incorporates lessons learned from other World Bank initiatives in the region, including the West Africa Agricultural 
Productivity Programs (WAAPP), the Great Green Wall initiative (GGW), the Sahel Irrigation Initiative Support Project 
(SIIP), and the Regional Sahel Pastoralism Support Project (PRAPS), among others.  

AICCRA will complement and add value to future World Bank lending operations in Africa. The World Bank is preparing a 
series of new lending operations to mobilize cutting-edge science in addressing food security needs in the face of the 
global climate crisis by promoting the successful adoption of proven technologies on a massive scale. Noteworthy among 
these is the West Africa Food System Resilience Program (FSRP) The success of FSRP, which forms part of the Africa 
Regional Integration and Cooperation Assistance Strategy, will depend critically on the ability of the participating entities 
to access the newest and most effective technologies available, especially those generated by CGIAR. AICCRA will 
complement FSRP by serving as a conduit for the international science generated by CGIAR Centers to reach the regional

and national actors who will be supported by FSRP (e.g. ECOWAS, CORAF).  

As a regional project, AICCRA will fill an important niche in the Word Bank’s’ Africa portfolio and help to advance the 
regional integration agenda. By supporting activities that will be implemented at sub-regional level through multi-actor 
networks, AICCRA will be able to achieve outcomes that cannot be achieved easily, if at all, by engaging with individual 
partners at country level. On the research supply side, working at regional level justifies investment in infrastructure and 
personnel at scales that surpass minimum critical mass and allow economies of scale to be captured. On the research 
demand side, working at regional level facilitates the flow of innovations across national borders and enhances learning 
effects, increasing the number of adopters and amplifying the benefits. 

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
The Development Objective is to increase access for agriculture research and extension service providers in Africa to 
knowledge, technologies, and decision making tools relevant to enhancing the resilience of agriculture and food systems 
in the face of climate change. 
 
Key Results (From PCN) 

 
Achievements of the Project will be measured using the following PDO level indicators: 
 
Results Area 1: Knowledge and tools needed to project likely impacts of climate change on agricultural systems available 
for use by beneficiaries in project area.  

Results Area 2: Climate-smart agriculture technologies available for upscaling in project area. 
 
D. Concept Description 
 

AICCRA will focus on bridging the gap between the research institutes that produce improved technologies and the 
development organizations that promote the adoption of improved technologies, for the purpose of enhancing the 
resilience of Africa’s agriculture and food systems in the face of climate change. Through support to CCAFS, AICCRA will 
strengthen the technical, institutional, and human capacity needed to move CGIAR innovations off the shelf and achieve 
impacts at scale in IDA-eligible countries in Africa. 

AICCRA will strengthen systemic capacity to monitor climate change in Africa, project the likely impacts of climate 
change on local agri-food systems, identify improved technologies that can strengthen the resilience of those systems in 
the face of climate change, and transfer knowledge about the improved technologies to agri-food system actors. The 
knowledge, technologies, and decision making tools promoted under AICCRA will be of value not only to productive agents 
(e.g., farmers, livestock keepers, assemblers, processors, and distributors), but also to the public, private, and civil society 
organizations that play critical roles in delivering improved technologies to productive agents.  

Climate advisories generated through monitoring networks and early warning systems work much better when they 
flow rapidly and easily into decision support systems and are integrated with input provision. For that reason, there is 
a need not only to strengthen monitoring and analytical capacity to make sure systems are in place that can generate 
timely and relevant climate advisories and early warnings, but also a need to implement policies and reinforce institutions 
to ensure that those climate advisories and early warnings can be translated into effective preventive actions, for example 
through changes in the types and amounts of inputs being used, or adjustments in management practices. In addition, 
decision support systems must be capable of channelling information from service users back to service providers, to 
inform research so that it becomes more demand-driven and responsive to local needs.

AICCRA will consist of four components. Box 1 provides illustrative examples of the results which are anticipated from the 
three large areas of support under AICCRA. The results will be further elaborated during project preparation and 
development of the results framework. All activities will be undertaken for the benefit of IDA-eligible SSA countries.   

Component 1. Knowledge and Services 

Component 1 will support the generation and sharing of knowledge products and tools that will address critical gaps in 
the design and provision of climate services, enable climate-informed investment planning, and support the design of 
policies to promote uptake of CSA practices. Activities to be supported under Component 1 will include one set of 
transversal activities to be pursued Africa-wide, as well as two subsets of geographically tailored activities to be pursued 
in Western and Eastern/Southern Africa, respectively. 

Subcomponent 1.1. Africa-wide. Sub-component 1.1 will support the generation of new knowledge and associated 
delivery platforms that are expected to be relevant throughout the region to improve targeting in the provision of agro-
climatic services as well as planning of CSA investments. The following activities will be financed, inter alia: (i) Identification 
of adaptation interventions targeted to agricultural land-use categories, small-scale farmer groups and associated climate 
hazards; (ii) Development of climate information service packages to accompany climate-smart interventions based on 
needs assessments and qualitative-quantitative cost-benefit analyses; (iii) Development or refinement of indicators and 
other adaptation tracking systems that can feed into planning processes and assist with national reporting related to NDCs 
and NAPs; (iv) Identification of big-ticket CSA investment opportunities, detailing the potential social, economic, and 
environmental benefits at national, regional, and continental scale (an example might be assessing the potential to launch 
large-scale initiatives to produce and distribute seed of drought-resilient varieties); (v) Development of business models 
and identification of innovative finance options for scaling-up CSA and climate-resilient value chains, with special 
consideration of gender and social inclusion; and (vi) Undertaking climate, agricultural and environmental policy 
coherence analyses to identify regional policy overlaps, gaps and alignment. 

Sub-component 1.2. Western Africa. Sub-component 1.2 will support the development of new or improved climate 
service tools that can help bridge the gap between meteorological services and agricultural extension systems. Activities 
to be financed include the development of ag-data hubs, design of climate service and visualization tools and 
dissemination systems and strengthening of partnerships for the delivery of early warnings, climate services, and climate-
informed digital agro-advisories to support agricultural decision-making. The sub-component will also seek to identify 
tailored climate information services and digital agro-advisory packages for use in building new extension systems or 
strengthening existing extension systems. Activities will take place in selected countries in Western Africa (Mali, Ghana 
and Senegal).  

Sub-component 1.3. Eastern and Southern Africa. Sub-component 1.3 will support the development of new or improved 
climate service tools that can help bridge the gap between meteorological services and agricultural extension systems. 
Activities to be financed include the development of ag-data hubs, design of climate service and visualization tools and 
dissemination systems, and strengthening of partnerships for the delivery of early warnings, climate services, and climate-
informed digital agro-advisories to support agricultural decision-making. The sub-component will also seek to identify 
tailored climate information services and digital agro-advisory packages for use in building new extension systems or 
strengthening existing extension systems. Activities will take place in selected countries in Eastern and Southern Africa 
(Ethiopia, Kenya and Zambia). 

Component 2. Partnerships for Delivery 

Component 2 will support building of partnerships and networks to strengthen the ability of actors all along the research-
to-development continuum to anticipate climate effects and project their likely impacts on agriculture, food security, and 
rural livelihoods, with the goal of accelerating the identification, prioritization, and uptake of best-bet adaptive measures

within defined application domains. Activities to be supported under Component 2 include training and building of 
partnerships and networks, at regional and national levels. A particular focus will be on planning and implementing 
appropriate delivery channels to promote the flow of innovative knowledge generated under Component 1, via regional 
and national partners.  

Subcomponent 2.1. Africa-wide. Sub-component 2.1 will support capacity development activities designed to strengthen 
the ability of regional multi-stakeholder platforms to conduct participatory visioning and priority setting, supported by 
quantitative and qualitative analytical methods at different scales. It will encourage engagement with regional institutions 
(AGRHYMET, ICPAC, and others) to collaborate in sharing knowledge and scaling up national climate services within and 
across regions. Where needed, it will backstop national, regional and continental groups involved in climate negotiations. 
Activities to be financed include, inter alia: (i) formal and informal training, (ii) workshops, (iii) study tours, (iv) knowledge 
exchanges, and (v) technical assistance. 

Sub-component 2.2. Western Africa. Sub-component 2.2 will support training and provide institutional support to 
enhance the capacity of diverse groups of beneficiaries to form innovative partnerships that can ensure sustained delivery 
and use of climate services. Activities to be financed include: (i) Strengthening of national meteorological services (NMS) 
real-time monitoring, weather forecasting, data archiving and generation systems; (ii) Capacity building of public and 
private sectors (e.g., NMSs, NARES, MoA, ICT companies and media) for effectiveness of context-specific climate services 
delivery models; (iii) Strengthening National Frameworks for Climate Services (NFCS) and supporting national stakeholders 
to implement effective governance for sustained national early warning, climate services and agro-advisory delivery; (iv) 
Training farmer organizations and other value chain actors in the use of climate services, co-production and feedback 
processes; and (v) Training extension officers, input providers, development agents, private sector and media for effective 
implementation and use of prioritized CSA options in crop and livestock value chains. Activities will take place in selected 
countries in Western Africa (Mali, Ghana and Senegal) 

Sub-component 2.3. Eastern and Southern Africa. Sub-component 2.3 will support training and provide institutional 
support to enhance the capacity of diverse groups of beneficiaries to form innovative partnerships that can ensure 
sustained delivery and use of climate services, Activities to be financed include: (i) Strengthening of national 
meteorological services (NMS) real-time monitoring, weather forecasting, data archiving and generation systems; (ii) 
Capacity building of public and private sectors (e.g., NMSs, NARES, MoA, ICT companies and media) for effectiveness of 
context-specific climate services delivery models; (iii) Strengthening National Frameworks for Climate Services (NFCS) and 
support national stakeholders to implement effective governance for sustained national early warning, climate services 
and agro-advisory delivery; (iv) Training farmer organizations and other value chain actors in the use of climate services, 
co-production and feedback processes; and (v) Training extension officers, input providers, development agents, private 
sector and media for effective implementation and use of prioritized CSA options in crop and livestock value chains. 
Activities will take place in Eastern and Southern Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya and Zambia). 

Component 3. Supporting the Uptake of Climate-Smart Agriculture  

Component 3 will support the uptake of CSA among small-scale farmers and intermediaries in selected value chains by 
supporting the validation of CSA technologies in the field, linking validated CSA technologies to technology transfer 
systems, and improving assess to climate-informed agricultural advisory services that will help farmers and other value 
chain actors make better decisions about CSA technologies and practices. It will also support the development of climate-
smart agriculture investment plans (CSAIPs) at national level as a sustainable scaling mechanism for CSA, coupled by CSA 
and CIS bundling collaborations through regional bodies.  

Subcomponent 3.1. Africa-wide. Sub-component 3.1 will support regional and continental efforts to promote the use of 
CIS in support of CSA at scale by influencing the planning and implementation mechanisms of regional bodies (i.e. African 
Risk Capacity) and large implementation agencies (i.e. WFP). Activities to be financed include: (i) Identification of initiatives

that are seeking to promote regional and continental collaboration around climate modeling, introduction or 
strengthening of early warning systems, and/or promotion of CSA technologies; (ii) Promoting dialogue among 
participants in these initiatives, with the goal of securing agreement on common standards and protocols for delivery of 
climate advisory services; (iii) Identification of opportunities to use regional and continental networks to promote 
dissemination of the results of CGIAR climate research; and (iv) Development of approaches and mechanisms to ensure 
sustainability of regional and continental initiatives.  

Sub-component 3.2. Western Africa. Sub-component 3.2 will support the uptake of CSA at national level in selected 
countries in Western Africa. Activities to be financed include: (i) Assessment of the climate-smartness of candidate 
technologies; (ii) Participatory selection and prioritization of best-bet and promising CSA options in key value chains, 
through stakeholder engagement; (iii) Identification of scaling mechanisms, especially for women and youth; (iv) 
Formulation of recommendations to be integrated into tailored climate-informed agro-advisory systems for distinct 
smallholder profiles; and (v) Refining of investment opportunities from existing climate-smart agriculture investment plans 
(CSAIPs), developing investment prospectus, and identifying specific investors and funding instruments, including new 
CSAIPs for countries without CSAIPs, as needed. Activities will take place in selected countries in Western Africa (Mali, 
Ghana and Senegal) 

Sub-component 3.3. Eastern and Southern Africa. Sub-component 3.2 will support the uptake of CSA at national level in 
selected countries in Eastern and Southern Africa. Activities to be financed include: (i) Assessment of the climate-
smartness of candidate technologies; (ii) Participatory selection and prioritization of best-bet and promising CSA options 
in key value chains, through stakeholder engagement; (iii) Identification of scaling mechanisms, especially for women and 
youth; (iv) Formulation of recommendations to be integrated into tailored climate-informed agro-advisory systems for 
distinct smallholder profiles; and (v) Refining of investment opportunities from existing climate-smart agriculture 
investment plans (CSAIPs), developing investment prospectus, and identifying specific investors and funding instruments, 
including new CSAIPs for countries without CSAIPs, as needed. Activities will take place in Eastern and Southern Africa 
(Ethiopia, Kenya and Zambia). 

Component 4. Project Management 

Component 4 will support project management functions. Consistent with the objective of strengthening systemic 
capacity in CGIAR, project management activities will be distributed among all of the CCAFS partners. CIAT as the Lead 
Center for CCAFS and recipient of the IDA grant will hold ultimate responsibility for technical, administrative, fiduciary, 
legal, and safeguards compliance functions. The CCAFS management team will provide oversight of the technical work 
program, ensure coordination among and between the implementation entities, supervise monitoring and evaluation 
activities and compile consolidated M&E reports documenting progress achieved. Under the shared accountability 
approach, the CCAFS implementation entities will be expected to comply with all applicable administrative, fiduciary 
(procurement and financial management), monitoring and evaluation, and safeguards requirements, and they will be 
responsible for providing information needed by the CCAFS management team and by CIAT to fulfill compliance with the 
terms of the IDA grant.

Corporate Review Decision  

 

I. Country and Sector Background  
 
1. The collapse of global oil prices, a persistently unstable regional security situation, and the high 
fiscal cost of ongoing humanitarian efforts, have strained Chad’s public finances. The Government has 
responded with a proactive but severe fiscal adjustment and the economy has experienced a deep and 
extended recession with high social costs. The crisis has also weighed heavily on the country’s ability to 
implement much needed structural reforms for non-oil sector recovery and social inclusion.  

2. Following a global oil price drop, Chad’s economy contracted 6.3 percent in 2016 and 3 percent 
in 2017. Chad’s oil sector has not only driven growth during boom years, but also translated falling oil 
prices into a sharp recession since 2016. The export price for Chadian crude oil fell from an average of 
US$100 per barrel in 2013-14 to US$34 in 2016, putting an abrupt end to growth rates around 6.3 percent 
per year in 2013-14. Oil-related fiscal revenues dropped from 11.7 percent of non-oil GDP in 2014 to just 
3.5 percent in 2016. Chad’s crisis has been aggravated by limited economic diversification and widespread 
poverty. In 2017, the economy struggled to recover and remained in recession, to a large extent due to 
an unexpected oil production shortfall.  

3. The new context of lower oil revenue, together with the challenging security and humanitarian 
situation, has greatly intensified economic, fiscal and social pressures. In the absence of adequate macro 
policy buffers and in the presence of immediate financing needs, the government had no room to 
undertake counter-cyclical fiscal policy to support economic recovery and protect social spending 
effectively. Monetary policy options have also been limited as the regional central bank is trying to 
manage the fallout from the oil price shock across Central African Economic and Monetary Union (CEMAC) 
members (including Chad). Regional security threats have negatively impacted growth by reducing cross-
border trade and kept foreign direct investment away. Significant security expenditures are linked to 
Chad’s continued efforts combating transnational terrorist groups (such as Boko Haram), supporting 
regional stabilization (peace-building) initiatives (2.8 percent of GDP in 2016), as well as providing for a

vast number of refugees and displaced persons (around 2.8 percent of 2016 GDP per year).1 Domestically, 
the government keeps diffusing tensions between agricultural communities and pastoralists. 

4. The government has demonstrated its determination to responsibly manage what has turned 
out to be a much deeper and longer fiscal crisis than expected. Continued efforts to restructure external 
commercial debt came to fruition in February 2018, when an agreement in principle was reached. This 
agreement will allow Chad’s public debt to return to sustainability and moderate risk of debt distress (as 
per the March 2018 Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Analysis). The substantial oil-collateralized loan with 
an international commodity firm – Glencore – had heavily reduced fiscal revenues and rendered debt 
unsustainable (see Box 1 for details). As a result, between 2014 and 2016, public spending was cut by 10.8 
percent of non-oil GDP, and since 2016 an emergency fiscal consolidation action plan has been adopted 
and extended in the 2017 Finance Law. Despite such sharp adjustment, Chad’s fiscal situation remained 
challenging during 2017, with a financing gap that required domestic arrears accumulation.  

5. Poverty reduction gains achieved over the past decade have been threatened by the current 
economic crisis.2  In the absence of a well-targeted and effective social safety net, the poor and vulnerable 
have likely been deeply affected by the crisis. During the oil boom, poverty rates declined (from 55 percent 
in 2003 to 47 percent in 2011), however, the absolute number of poor increased from 4.9 million to 5.6 
million due to population growth. Progress on non-monetary poverty also presents a mixed picture. Since 
the beginning of the crisis, dwindling fiscal resources have disrupted vital public services despite the 
government’s efforts to protect priority social spending. Payments to community-based teachers and 
health workers, funding for student scholarships, social-program benefits, and the provision of 
agricultural inputs have either been delayed or halted altogether at various occasions, and all public 
investment projects have been suspended.  

II. Proposed Objective(s) 
 
6. The primary objectives of the series are to enhance fiscal and oil sector risk management and 
transparency, promote economic diversification, and improve social protection for the poor and 
vulnerable. To achieve these objectives, the programmatic series is organized around four intertwined 
pillars: First, it aims at enhancing fiscal risk management through (a) improved debt management, (b) 
rationalization of tax expenditures, (c) streamlining the payroll for enhanced fiscal space, and (d) improved 
oversight and transparency in the management of SOEs. Second, to improve the contribution of the oil 
sector to fiscal sustainability and economic resilience it promotes (i) a functional oil revenue management 
mechanism; (ii) transparency in the sector; and (iii) improved control over oil production costs. Third, to 
increase diversification and resilience of Chad’s population in face of economic and climatic shocks, the 
operation (a) contributes to greater agricultural productivity for more sustainable and inclusive growth; 
and (b) strengthens the contribution of the ICT sector to inclusive growth through enhanced affordability 
and coverage of services, as well as improved transparency for public and private service delivery. Fourth, 
it increases social protection for the poor and most vulnerable groups including refugees, by developing 
an effective and well-targeted social safety net system, and implementing cash transfers.  

 

                                                 
1 Of the more than 750,000 displaced people currently living in Chad, 403,780 are refugees. The number of refugees is equivalent 
to over 3 percent of the population, the fifth-highest level in the world. See: UNHCR and World Bank IDA18 refugee Sub-Window 
Board Consultation Paper (September 19, 2017). 
2 The latest poverty data are available as of 2011 only. 



III. Rationale for Bank Involvement 
 

7. Building on the 2017 Emergency Fiscal Stabilization Operation (EFSO), this series shifts Bank 
support towards a structural resilience and growth agenda. The authorities aim at sustaining growth 
recovery, fostering economic diversification in the medium term, and developing coping mechanisms for 
the poor and vulnerable. Four intertwined pillars combine structural measures to enhance fiscal risk 
management with boosting economic diversification and social resilience. Improved debt management, 
SOE oversight and oil revenue management are complemented by increased productivity in agriculture 
and competitive, open access information and communication technologies (ICT). Finally, putting in place 
a well-targeted and fully operational social protection system for the poor and vulnerable adds an explicit 
micro layer of resilience.  

8. The program supported by the proposed series is closely aligned with the three pillars of the 
Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for FY16-20. The CPF was discussed at the Board on December 10, 
2015. The CPF, which succeeded the interim strategy note for FY10-12, is based on three engagement 
themes: (i) strengthening fiscal management; (ii) improving the returns to agriculture and developing 
agricultural value chains; and (iii) building the stock of human capital and reducing socioeconomic 
vulnerability.  

9. The proposed series follows a sequence of efforts by the World Bank to help the Chadian 
government cope with the impact of multiple exogenous shocks and lay the groundwork for sustained 
growth recovery and social inclusion. In December 2015, the Board approved the Fiscal Consolidation 
Program Support Grant (FCPSG), Chad’s first development policy operation in a decade. The FCPSG aimed 
to reinforce macroeconomic stability, protect critical expenditures, and initiate a medium-term structural 
reform agenda. It supported measures to broaden the tax base, rationalize public spending, enhance PFM 
transparency, and streamline business-registration procedures. In December 2016, as a protracted slump 
in global oil prices coupled with persistently high security and humanitarian costs further strained Chad’s 
fiscal resources, the Board approved US$80 million in additional financing for the FCPSG through Crisis 
Response Window allocation. The FCPSG’s implementation has been broadly on track, with a substantial 
in of the number of taxpaying firms and newly registered businesses observed despite the difficult 
economic climate. While less progress has been achieved in enhancing public procurement and limiting 
recourse to extraordinary spending procedures, the government is now preparing to implement a new 
procurement code, while the fiscal consolidation and the recent shift to cash-based budgeting are 
expected to curb the use of extraordinary spending procedures. Considering the country’s dire macro-
fiscal situation, the World Bank also approved a US$65 million emergency development policy financing 
operation - the EFSO – in June 2017, which builds on the FCPSG and has helped the government meet 
urgent financing needs while laying the groundwork for more substantive reforms. 

IV. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 
 

10. The government’s Negotiation Committee will oversee the implementation of the reform 
program supported by the proposed operation. The Negotiation Committee, which is chaired by the 
Ministry of Economy and Development Planning, is an inter-ministerial committee charged with 
coordinating the preparation of the proposed operation and monitoring the reform program. The 
participating ministries, departments, and agencies will provide information on the status of their 
respective programs, and the committee will monitor their progress against program objectives. The 
committee previously collaborated with both the IMF and the World Bank during the successful HIPC 
completion process and the implementation of the FCPSG. A results framework will define concrete 



indicators and empirical benchmarks to monitor progress and facilitate ex post evaluation following the 
end of the program. 

V. Risk and Risk Mitigation 
 

11. The overall risk rating for the proposed operation is high. Political and governance risks, 
macroeconomic risks, and risks related to institutional capacity for implementation and sustainability are 
especially serious.   

12. Following the agreement in principle to restructure the debt to Glencore, debt vulnerabilities 
declined significantly. Public debt remains in distress for the time being. Once the final agreement is 
reached and progress is made on clearing the outstanding external arrears, other things equal, the risk 
rating would be expected to be upgraded to moderate under the current LIC DSF methodology. 

13. Risks of delayed structural reforms in sensitive areas because of political resistance cannot be fully 
mitigated and remain high.  Against the backdrop of continued exposure to oil price and production 
shocks, the government has demonstrated a strong commitment to fiscal discipline and an ability to 
maintain a sound fiscal stance in a challenging economic context. While CEMAC membership has 
bolstered macroeconomic stability in recent years, CEMAC’s low foreign-exchange reserves and the 
constrained fiscal space of its members pose additional downside risks.  Risks related to institutional 
capacity for implementation and sustainability will be mitigated by leveraging ongoing and planned World 
Bank projects in the policy areas supported by the proposed series, as well as technical assistance from 
Chad’s development partners, including France, the AfDB, EU, IMF and CEMAC. 

 

VI. Poverty and Social Impacts and Environment Aspects 
 
Poverty and Social Impacts 
 
14. The proposed series is expected to have a significant positive impact on poverty reduction in 
the medium and longer term. The proposed operation is expected to help decrease poverty in the 
medium and long term through the promotion of inclusive growth in agriculture, and the development of 
more affordable ICT services and broader coverage in underserved areas. In addition, a properly targeted 
expansion of the social safety net system has the potential to have a significant impact on allowing 
households to move out of poverty and strengthen household resilience to shocks. The overall impact on 
poverty therefore is expected to be positive in the medium and longer term.  

15. Medium term efficiency gains in fiscal and debt management and better overall risk 
management are expected to improve fiscal space for social protection and other public services as well 
as pro-growth investment. While fiscal rationing and stabilization policies of the Government may have 
a negative short-term impact on poverty through public sector job losses or decreases in public services, 
however, medium term efficiency gains in fiscal and debt management and better overall risk 
management should clearly improve fiscal space for social protection and other public services as well as 
pro-growth investment. Improved control of fiscal risks should also contribute to macroeconomic stability, 
which is beneficial to growth and poverty reduction. The social costs associated to the elimination of 
irregularities in the payroll is likely to have only negligible social costs. However, the payroll audit may set 
the stage for deeper reforms of the civil service (beyond the scope of this operation), which would likely 
involve significant social costs and would require careful evaluation and adequate mitigation.  



 
16.   The proposed reforms in agriculture and ICT may lead to a more diversified economy and 
improved public services. As around 80 percent of Chad’s labor force is active in agriculture, productivity 
gains stemming from enhanced dissemination and adoption of agricultural technology and more effective 
input supply chains is bound to result in broad positive effects for vulnerable and poor households. The 
development of more affordable ICT technologies is also expected to contribute directly, over the medium 
term, to the provision of better public services. This would benefit the poor who tend to rely 
disproportionately on public services. Cheaper, more effective ICT services in Chad, may also contribute 
directly to inclusive growth in agriculture by facilitating extension services, but also have cross cutting 
positive spillover effects for most sectors using ICT as an input. Ultimately, effective ICT is also expected 
to support faster and more efficient implementation of social safety nets and related transfer and social 

protection systems nationwide. 

 
17. The expected medium-term impact of the reforms included in this operation on gender equity 
is positive.  In the medium to longer term, increased fiscal space for health, education, and social safety 
nets would have positive impacts on services benefitting women. Increased spending for health may 
contribute to decrease very high maternal mortality rates. At 856 deaths per 100,000 women, Chad ranks 
only above CAR and Sierra Leone in international comparisons.3  In addition, increased funding for 
education and social safety nets may support improved school attendance for girls. Families with limited 
resources often prioritize the education of sons, and, despite recent improvements, the 2014/15 
Demographic and Health Survey shows that 44 percent of girls aged 15 to 19 have never attended school, 
compared to 30 percent of boys in the same age group.  To help address this, the implementation of the 
NSPS clearly identifies women as the most vulnerable population, and targets them specifically as the 
primary recipients of cash transfers and cash for works programs. 
 
Environment Aspects  
 
18. The reforms and policy actions supported by the proposed operation are not likely to have 
significant negative effects on the country’s environment, forests and other natural resources. 
Environmental Assessment (EA) is a legal requirement in Chad and is widely applied to all developmental 
projects. The EA process is based on Presidential Decree No. 630/PR/PM/MEERH/2010 on EA regulations 
and the ministerial decision No. 039/PR/PM/MERH/SG/DGE/DEELCPN/2012 with respect to the general 
guidelines and procedures for environmental assessment. The department of environmental assessment 
and pollution control in the Ministry of Environment and Fisheries is institutionally saddled with reviewing 
and clearing environmental impact assessment (EIA) documents. 
 
19. As per the Policy on Development Policy Financing, the World Bank assessed whether specific 
country policies supported by the DPF series are likely to cause significant effects on the country’s 
environment, forests, and other natural resources. The assessment concluded that the policies 
supported by the proposed DPF are not likely to have negative impacts on the country ‘s natural assets. 
All the actions supported throughout the operation are policy-oriented; they do not support direct 
investment in environmentally impactful investments or involve policy actions with significant 
environmental consequences. The assessment of potential impacts related to actions supported by the 
DPF will rely on the existing national legal and regulatory framework, and will be monitored and addressed 
through the national procedures in place in Chad. 
 

                                                 
3 World Health Statistics 2016, World Health Organization. 



20. Prior actions and triggers designed for increasing social protection for the poor, vulnerable and 
refugees are also largely environmental neutral. Although some cash for work under the social 
protection programs could be expected to have some small physical footprint, the Government will 
finance significant capacity-building activities including environmental and social safeguards through the 
Cellule Filet Social (CFS) established on March 10, 2016. In conjunction with department of environmental 
assessment and pollution control, the CFS will play a key role in minimizing any environmental and social 
adverse impacts and enhancing the positive ones derived from social protection programs. Further, the 
operation’s focus on ensuring adequate fiscal space to preserve pro-poor spending and maintain the 
government’s capacity for effective social protection policy could indirectly support environmental 
objectives by mitigating the need for rural households to resort to environmentally unsustainable 
practices in the event of a natural disaster or a shock to agricultural production. 
 
21. Prior actions with respect to reforms in the agriculture and ICT sectors may have positive or 
little impact on the environment. Improved seeds will increase productivity at the intensive margin, 
thereby reducing the need to increase cultivated land size and grow at the external margin. Although this 
operation focuses uniquely on open access to Chad’s fiber backbone, potential extension of geographic 
coverage of mobile networks at a later stage could involve the destruction of some flora and fauna. 
However, any potential environmental impact could be minimized by avoiding areas were the impact will 
be substantial. Also, the licensed operators would be encouraged to begin revegetation of excavated sites 
immediately the sites have been backfilled. 
 
22. The Government’s reform agenda encompasses a robust institutional framework for 
environmental protection. The NDP includes a pillar dedicated to environmental protection and 
adaptation to climate change built on four key elements: (i) the protection of Lake Chad and other critical 
ecosystems; (ii) improved land management in rural and urban areas; (iii) the mitigation of risks related 
to natural disasters; and (iv) the fight against desertification and the conservation of biodiversity. The 
1998 Environmental Code was augmented in 2009 by a decree on pollution and environmental damage. 
The use of charcoal is officially forbidden in Ndjamena to minimize indoor air pollution, and the country 
is promoting the use of improved cooking stoves. Nevertheless, indoor air pollution remains a major 
health risk, and access to clean fuels is limited. The Environmental Code also defines principles for solid 
and hazardous waste management, though these are poorly enforced. The GoC promulgated a Forestry 
Law in 2008 that clearly distinguishes between conservation and production activities.

B.   Introduction and Context

Country Context
African agricultural development acquired new momentum when, in January 2014, the African 
Union adopted the Malabo Declaration on Accelerated Agricultural Growth and 
Transformational➢❬¢ in which African Heads of States and Governments recommitted 
themselves to the Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Program (CAADP) principles 
and values to uphold the 10 percent target for public spending on agriculture, to double 
agricultural productivity, and thus to sustain annual growth in agricultural GDP at 6 percent or 
higher. 
 
During the same period, there was a renewed commitment of development partners to engage and 
invest in the agricultural sector. Several initiatives are being launched, including from the United 
Nations, the African Development Bank and the World Bank. The United Nation adopted the new 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), and the second of the seventeen proposed SDGs is to end 
hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agricultural. The 
African Development Bank launched (Feed Africa: Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in 
Africa, 2016-2025) which aims to end hunger and rural poverty in Africa in the next decade. 
Also, the World Bank has committed itself to twin goals: eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 
and boosting shared prosperity, measured as the income of the bottom 40 percent in any given 
country.
Sectoral and institutional Context
One of the main challenges in West Africa is satisfying the demands of a rapidly growing 
population that is expected to increase from 300 million in 2011 to about 500 million by 2030. 
The 2008 food, fuel, and financial crisis has demonstrated the need to base food security in West 
Africa on the utilization of the region's huge agricultural potential, as this option would 
simultaneously contribute to economic growth and reduction of poverty. Moreover, meta-analyses 
conducted by International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) have shown that the benefits 
from productivity growth attributed to agricultural research exceed their costs by a factor of 10 or 
more whereas high rates of return on investments in science for agriculture, to the order of 40-60 
per cent, have also been consistently proven. 
 
Gains from smart investments in agricultural R&D were amply demonstrated by WAAPP impact 
analysis completed under the first phase of WAAPP in Mali, Senegal, Ghana, Cote d➢❨ Ivoire 
and Guinea. The analysis found that: (i) WAAPP beneficiaries have increased their yields and 
income by at least 30 percent over the control group; (ii) most of these gains resulted from the 
adoption of new varieties, improved crop management practices and improved small scale food 
processing technologies; and (iii) the immediate pathways exist to achieve rapid growth in 
agriculture through greater focus on productivity enhancement using a regional integration 
approach. The analysis also showed that program beneficiaries experienced a reduction in hunger 
by half and also improved their nutrition standards.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Original Project Development Objective(s) - Parent
To generate and accelerate the adoption of improved technologies in the participating countries' 
top agricultural commodity priority areas that are aligned with the sub-region's top agricultural 
commodity priorities, as outlined in the ECOWAP.



Page 3 of 11

Key Results 
As it concerns the achievement of the WAAPP in the targeted countries, as of October 2016, the 
project has reached in the four countries a total of more than 1 million direct beneficiaries 
(1,153,000), about 26 technologies have been generated by the NCOS in Benin and Niger and the 
rice research system in Guinea, close to 1.1 million hectares (1,083,000) have been covered by the 
new technologies and more than 650,000 producers/processors have adopted at least one new 
technology. The disbursement performance of the project is also satisfactory; more than 96 
percent of the parent project (WAAPP-1C) financing is disbursed, and an action plan is being 
implemented which will ensure full disbursement by the current closing date of December 2016.

D.  Project Description

The AF will build upon the achievements of the original project to complete, consolidate and 
expand project activities. Therefore there will not be change in the project development objective 
and component structure as well as or safeguard category. The proposed AF will also continue to 
use the implementation arrangements and technical design of the original project. 
However, the primary focus of the AF will be to scale up the adoption the innovations and 
technologies generated by the WAAPP (more than 174 technologies have been released by the 
Program to improve agricultural production, post harvest, processing and mechanization). Thus 
the AF will add a particular focus on marketing of these technologies and innovations in order to 
scale up their adoption and to increase food availability in the sub region, and thereby contribute 
to poverty alleviation and agricultural growth. And since some of these technologies have 
different level of marketability and their scope for adoption also varies markedly the AF will 
among others, include the contracting of a private firm/NGO by CORAF/WECARD to design a 
technology marketing strategy and a technology marketing specialists in each country to 
implement an action plan for the commercialization of the technologies. In this framework the AF 
will finance incubation centers and seed money for job creation for greater citizen engagement, 
youth and women, and provide incentives and mechanisms to actively involve the private sector 
and mobilize some of their resources for the development of the targeted value chains. 
 
And in order to take the above scaled-up activities of the AF into account, the project➢❨ s Results 
Framework will be updated to review the targets of the indicators and also include the new 
indicators on job creation/employment, nutrition, citizen engagement and private sector 
participation. In addition the closing date of the original project will be extended to correspond to 
the duration of the AF. The Risk ratings have been updated to reflect experience gained during 
implementation of the original project.

Component Name

(b) Component 2: Strengthening National Centers of Specialization/Strengthening of the 
Research System
Comments (optional)
The component will finance: (ii) for Benin and Niger, the implementation of  their action plans to 
transform the National Centers of Specialization (NCOS) into Regional Centers of Excellence 
(RCOE) for agricultural research in maize and livestock, respectively; and (ii) for Togo and 
Guinea, which does not have an NCOS, the upgrading of their adaptive research systems to 
participate more actively in the network of the RCEO and bring and adapt in their countries the

Adoption.
Comments (optional)
The  component will finance: (i) financing through the competitive agriculture grant schemes the 
completion of the ongoing research and a limited number of new on-demand projects that may be 
commissioned; (ii) strengthening the regional technology market including organizing local and 
regional technology fairs; (ii) upscaling the adoption of existing technologies and innovations 
with a much greater emphasis on nutrition-sensitive and climate smart agriculture technologies 
that have high potential for accelerating job creation for youth and women (iii) implementing  an 
action plan to scale-up commercialization of the promising technologies to facilitate private sector 
investment and create more jobs for young agro-entrepreneurs; and (iv) strengthen the regional 
seed market and upscale the p

Component Name
(d) Component 4: Project Coordination, Management and Monitoring and Evaluation.
Comments (optional)
The Project will continue to finance the existing Project Coordination Unit (PCUs) in Togo, 
Niger, Benin and Guinea selected additional staffs and specifically a technology marketing 
specialist in each country.

E.  Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis (if known)

The project in each of these fours countries has a national coverage. Although it would be mainly 
developed in R&D centers, newly availed WAAPP technologies will also be expanded to new 
farmers own lands to ensure technologies contribute indeed to alleviate poverty and shared 
prosperity. These technologies would be gender sensitive and youth-driven as the project seeks at 
engaiging more women and youth as citizen for sustainable development.

II. Implementation
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 
 
The proposed AF does not foresee any changes in terms of implementation arrangements. The AF 
will be placed under the technical responsibility of the Ministry in charge of Agriculture in each of 
the participating countries and under the responsibility of CORAF for the regional level activities. 
The PCUs in each country and CORAF will therefore continue to coordinate project activities, 
prepare the Annual Work Program and Budgets (AWPB), organize the Implementation Support 
Missions (ISM) and ensure project Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). The PCUs and CORAF have 
a solid track record for Social and Environmental Safeguards, procurement, financial management 
and M&E, which have consistently been rated satisfactory or moderately satisfactory throughout the 
parent project implementation. CORAF and each PCU will be strengthened with an additional staff 
who will be specialized in Technology Marketing and Commercialization. The Guinea PCU will be 
reinforced with additional staffs including two social and Environmental specialists (each with 
specific responsibilities), a financial management specialist, a procurement specialist and a technical 
expert. Implementation of the AF activities will also be supported by strategic institutional and 
technical partners, as well as service providers (other agencies, NGOs, CSO, etc.) who will be 
contracted through the: i) result-based MOUs for public service providers and other Projects and ii) 
result- based contracts for private service providers and NGOs.

III. Safeguard Policies that might apply

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental Assessment 
OP/BP 4.01

Yes The AF is a Category-B project due to the fact that 
potential social and environmental impacts are 
expected to be local, site-specific and easily 
manageable. Because it is a continuation of 
WAAPP-1C the ESMF has been updated, revised 
and adapted within the context of the focus of the AF 
on scaling up technology adoption which follows the 
same line of intervention of the parent project. The 
ESMF includes further provisions for capacity 
strengthening at all levels for the successful 
implementation of the project safeguard measures, in 
compliance with national and Bank safeguard 
policies. The updated version of the ESMF was 
reviewed, cleared by both CORAF and World Bank 
and then disclosed simultaneously both in CORAF 
websites and at the InfoShop on November 18, 2016.

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No The AF is not supporting any agricultural sites near 
wetlands, mangroves, or other critical habitats . It 
will work on improving productivity on existing 
developed land.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No The AF is not supporting any extension of cropping 
area and therefore no damage of forests is expected. 



Page 6 of 11

It will develop its activities on land already under 
exploitation.

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes The AF will scale up the parent project 
achievements. The initial PMP was revised, updated 
and adapted to reflect the AF interventions and set 
forth the basic principles each member-country 
would follow to adequately handle the possible usage 
of pesticides, particularly as the AF will focus on 
dissemination of agriculture technologies. Upon 
completion, the updated version of the  PMP was 
reviewed, cleared by both CORAF and World Bank 
and then disclosed simultaneously both in CORAF 
websites and at the InfoShop on November 18, 2016.

Physical Cultural Resources 
OP/BP 4.11

No The project will not finance activities that threaten 
culturral ressources.

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 
4.10

No There are no indigenous peoples in the project area.

Involuntary Resettlement OP/
BP 4.12

Yes The AF is a category B project due to the fact that 
foreseen social and environmental impacts are 
expected to be local, sites specific and easily 
manageable.  OP/BP 4.12 is triggered for Guinea 
only because  of the expected land acquisition, loss 
of assets or loss of access to livelihoods support 
means upon which local beneficiary communities 
depend. To comply with OP/BP 4.12 policy 
principles and guidelines Guinea prepared a 
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) on how to 
comply with the above mentioned land use/right 
issues. Upon completion, the RPF was reviewed, 
cleared by both CORAF and World Bank and then 
disclosed simultaneously both in CORAF websites 
and at the InfoShop on November 18, 2016.

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No The AF is not involving any construction or 
rehabilitation of dams.

Projects on International 
Waterways OP/BP 7.50

No The AF does not affect or involve international 
waterways.

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/
BP 7.60

No The AF is not in a disputed area.

IV. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify 

and describe any potential large scale,  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
Social (including Safeguards). The AF is expected to have no significant negative social impacts. 
Project beneficiaries are mainly small-scale farmers  in food crop production for national, regional 
and international markets - in which women play a critical role.The Project will work to ensure 



Page 7 of 11

that the circumstances of small-scale farmers, particularly women and youth, are accounted for in 
setting priorities. Adaptive research will be conducted in farmers➢❨  fields. Competitive grants to 
implement R&D will be open to producers➢❨  organizations and agribusiness associations and not 
only to research organizations. The Project will work with development operations and public/
private partnerships to scale up producers➢❨  use of technologies. 
 
As a Category B Project, the foreseen social impacts are expected to be local, mostly sites specific 
and easily manageable. The Involuntary Resettlement operational policy (OP/BP 4.12) has been 
triggered only or Guinea - where the project will cover new commodities and new intervention 
areas, because of the expected land acquisition, loss of assets or loss of access to livelihoods 
support means upon which local beneficiary communities depend. To comply with WB OP/BP 
4.12 policy principles and guidelines, Guinea has prepared a Resettlement Policy Framework 
(RPF) on how to comply with the above mentioned land use/right issues. The RPF was amply 
consulted upon and stakeholders feedback provided in the annexes of the documents. 
 
Environment (including Safeguards). The AF is expected to have a positive environmental impact 
through its support for agricultural technologies that promote better use of land and water 
resources. Potential environmental risks could include point and non-point pollution of water 
sources, other issues associated with the use of agricultural chemicals, and negative environmental 
impacts associated with the rehabilitation of irrigation or small-scale civil works on research 
stations. Research on transgenic crops is neither explicitly planned nor excluded. If it becomes part 
of the research agenda supported under the Project, it will proceed with social and environmental 
safeguards consultants with international good practice and the regulatory framework of the host 
country. In particular, such research must be done in accordance with the obligation of each 
country under international treaties to which it is a party, including the Cartagena Protocol on 
Biosafety (for Burkina Faso and Nigeria). Potential adverse environmental impacts associated with 
the NCoS activities will be of low intensity, minor, site specific, and handled under safeguard 
measures already in place for ongoing activities.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities 
in the project area:
NA

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts.
NA

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
This is an additional financing to a project which was implemented during a 5 year period. During 
the parent project phase a close supervision of the implementation of safeguards measures were 
conducted by the social and environmental safeguards specialists of the World Bank. In addition 
each country and CORAF appointed social and environmental safeguard focal points in charge of 
ensuring that the social and environmental safeguards are well implemented and mitigation 
measures are also identified and implemented. A capacity building plan was also implemented 
including two regional training workshops and several country level workshops for all safeguard 
focal points. The recent ISM in June 2016 rated compliance with safeguards policies as 
satisfactory for the 4 recipient countries and indicates that both the safeguards focal points have 
the required knowledge and are playing a key role in ensuring that safeguards measures are well 
implemented. However, it was convened that each PIU will recruit/appoint one qualified 



Page 8 of 11

environmental safeguards specialist and one qualified social safeguards specialist, to improve the 
safeguards performance. The ESMF and the PMP have been updated, including a better 
clarification of roles and responsibilities for safeguards implementation among the PIU staff; this 
role distribution will be inserted in the Project implementation manual (PIM). An RPF has been 
developed for Guinea as recommended by the policy, since Guinea will be developing a variety of 
new crops which would probably need additional lands acquisition or encroachment of which. in 
public domain, would need a proper handing and payment of compensation to the recipient 
communities. All these documents include measures to ensure that safeguard requirements are 
being properly complied with.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
A comprehensive set of stakeholder were consulted during the preparation of the safeguards 
documents for the original project. Similarly, consultations were done during the preparation of 
the AF that included various beneficiaries, agricultural, social, and environmental, health agencies 
as well as some NGOs and other civil society agencies. Producers/processors and their 
organizations at the sub region levels (ROPPA) and at national levels were also consulted. 
Following the consultations the original safeguard documents were updated for the AF and each 
country organized a national stakeholder workshop to disseminate and validate the documents. 
Key issues and recommendations of the workshops were used to improve the safeguards 
documents. Recommendations from both the client and the Bank and from the stakeholders 
workshop have been reflected in the final draft of the ESMP, PMP and RPF.

I. Introduction and Context
Country Context
The Republic of Angola, with a total population of 24.3 million inhabitants, covers an area of about 
1.25 million km2 and is located on the Atlantic coast of south-western Africa. According to the 
2014 population census, 52 percent of the total population are women and about 38 percent live in 
rural areas.  
 
Angola became independent from Portugal in 1975. This was followed by a civil war that lasted for 
almost 25 years from 1975 to 2002 and ended with a peace agreement in 2002. Angola is one of 
Africa’s resource-rich countries, with a large potential for economic growth based on many mineral

resources (particularly oil and diamonds) as well as agriculture. 
 
Agriculture contributes to approximately 10 percent of GDP, the industry sector accounts for  60 
percent of GDP and the services to about 30 percent. However, the economy of Angola is 
predominantly oil based.  The oil sector accounts for almost 45 percent of the GDP, 95 percent of 
total export value and 80 percent of government revenues. Oil prices are at a four years low and 
have declined by about 40 percent since June 2014. Currently oil prices are below US$50 per barrel. 
With the declining international oil prices, the government would like to reduce this dependence on 
the oil sector and promote diversification of the economy, including expanding the role of 
agriculture. 
 
Projections for GDP growth made by the government are: 9.7 percent in 2015; 5.9 percent in 2016 
and 5.1 percent in 2017. Growth is mainly driven by the recovery of the oil sector and an increase in 
public investments in the non-oil sectors. This includes, among others, rehabilitation of roads, 
increase in energy production, and development of new irrigation systems to enhance agricultural 
productivity. The average inflation rate is projected to be about 7 percent by end of 2015. While 
macroeconomic prospects in the medium-term are challenging due to declining oil prices, 
macroeconomic performance and commitment to reforms have been favorable. 
 
While reasonable progress has been made toward achievement of the Millennium Development 
Goals (MDGs), Angola is not likely to meet the MDGs by 2015. Angola ranks low in both the 
human development indicators and business environment indicators. Overall, institutional capacity 
remains weak. There are bureaucratic hurdles and governance challenges that inhibit growth of the 
private sector. 
 
The performance related to social indicators has been mixed. Good progress has been made in 
poverty reduction, primary education and gender equality since 2002. Despite these achievements, 
however, social indicators remain very poor. For example, life expectancy at birth is about 51 years. 
Maternal mortality is 450 out of 100,000 births which is the highest in sub-Sahara Africa. 
Malnutrition is also acute with 30 percent of children less than five years of age suffering from 
stunting and 16 percent are under-weight. 
 
The overall poverty rate has declined from 62 percent in 2001 to about 37 percent in 2009 (about 
nine million people). This is a major achievement. However, there are major regional disparities in 
the poverty rate across provinces as well as between rural and urban sectors. In the rural areas the 
poverty rate is almost 58 percent. On the other hand, the poverty rate in Luanda (the largest city in 
the country) is only about 9 percent. Clearly there is a great need to reduce poverty rates in the rural 
areas. 
 
Angola is estimated to have about 57 million hectares of arable land of which less than 4 million 
hectares are currently under cultivation. Despite enormous potential to increase cropped area and 
crop yields, and diverse agro-climate regions in the country for increasing food production, national 
and household food security continues to depend on imports of various food commodities and this 
cannot be sustained. Angola continues to import a significant share of food consumption, except for 
roots and tubers. For example, the overall output of cereals is currently estimated at 1.9 million MT 
against a total consumption need of 3 million MT. The difference (1.1 million MT or 36 percent of 
the needs) is met through imports. In other words, national food security remains a major 
development issue.

Global experience suggests that growth in agriculture has much higher potential than in other 
sectors (such as industry) to reduce rural poverty. Inclusive growth in the agricultural sector can 
make a major contribution to diversify the economy, accelerate economic growth, increase food 
security, reduce rural poverty, improve social indicators in the rural areas, and help achieve MDGs. 
The proposed agricultural project envisages a major impulse to the agricultural sector that will not 
only increase productivity and production but will also improve the lives of rural population at 
large, thus providing for structural change and transformation of the agricultural sector in the project 
areas.

Sectoral and Institutional Context
While agriculture accounts for only about 10 percent of the GDP, almost two-thirds of the 
population depend directly or indirectly on agriculture for their income, employment and livelihood. 
About 37 percent of the population is below the poverty line and about 85 percent of the poor are in 
the rural areas and depend on agriculture.  The cropping pattern varies across the agro-climatic 
conditions in the country. However, Central Highlands (Huambo, Bie and Malanje Provinces) 
appear to have a high density of population and a high potential for agricultural production, 
including cassava, maize, beans, potato and horticulture. 
 
Prior to independence, Angola had a long history of exporting agricultural commodities, having 
been once the third largest exporter of coffee in the world. Exportable surpluses, such as coffee and 
maize, were for the most part produced using traditional technologies and few modern inputs. 
During the colonial period (up to 1975), agriculture had a dual structure with a commercial sector of 
about 800,000 ha managed by Portuguese settlers using modern technologies, and a traditional 
sector primarily composed of smallholder family farms cultivating about 3.4 million ha.  
 
After independence, most of the Portuguese settlers left the country and many of the former 
commercial farms and plantations were converted into state farms, which have now been privatized. 
The civil war (1975 to 2002) resulted in a virtual collapse of commercial production as large 
numbers of rural inhabitants either fled or reverted to subsistence agricultural production. 
Infrastructure suffered a great deal with widespread destruction of roads, bridges, irrigation systems 
and warehouses, compounded by the presence of thousands of land mines in the rural areas. 
Although the situation has improved since the end of the civil war with the rehabilitation of main 
roads and bridges, and clearance of mines, agricultural exports are currently negligible. The 
agricultural sector has not yet fully recovered from the de-capitalization experienced during the civil 
war. 
 
With recent developments in the rehabilitation of infrastructure that includes main roads and 
bridges, agricultural production gradually started to increase since 2002.  However, crop yields 
remain very low as compared to other countries in sub-Sahara Africa. According to FAO statistics, 
the average yield in Angola of beans is 0.34 tons/ha compared to 0.6t/ha in the region; groundnuts 
0.38 t/ha compared to 0.88 t/ha in the region and millet 0.24 t/ha compared to 0.7 t/ha in region.  
This implies that there is substantial scope for increasing crop yields and production through 
agricultural modernization and technical change as well as through an increase in cultivated area. 
However, this will require the use of animal traction power, adoption of improved agronomic 
practices, improvements in soil fertility, use of modern agricultural inputs, bringing cropped area 
under irrigation, and disseminating agricultural knowledge to farmers. In addition, there is a 
substantial scope and need to strengthen market linkages, improve commercialization and build

agro-business facilities through local entrepreneurs.  
 
At present, almost 80 percent of the farmers are smallholders, with weak capacity and limited 
knowledge of improved agricultural practices. Human capital in agricultural education, research and 
extension institutions suffered a great deal during the civil war and have not yet been fully 
strengthened or replaced. The institutional capacity in the agricultural sector, including irrigation 
and agricultural statistics, is extremely weak. The agricultural programs are designed and 
implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture at the national level and by the Departments of 
Agriculture at the provincial levels. The capacity of these agencies needs to be strengthened as well. 
 
The Bank-supported Angola Market Oriented Smallholder Agriculture Project (MOSAP), approved 
by the Board in July 2008 and implemented over the past years, was designed to increase 
agricultural production through the provision of improved agricultural services and investment 
support to rural smallholder farmers. Activities implemented under the project include: (a) training 
of over 44,000 smallholder farmers in the use of improved agricultural technologies to boost 
production of the major crops targeted by the project (the training was provided by service providers 
recruited under the Project as well as training provided by FAO to over 14,000 producers on family 
farms through Farmers’ Field Schools ); (b) training of more than 60 technicians; and (c) provision 
of financial support to over 14,000 smallholder beneficiaries through financing of around 280 sub-
projects ; and (d) capacity building for staff from the Agrarian Development Institute (ADI) of the 
Ministry of Agriculture at targeted municipalities. 
 
In addition to the provision of capacity building, MOSAP contributed to: (i) an increase in 
agricultural production; and (ii) the adoption of improved technologies in the project areas.  The 
crop index during the 2013/14 season was 64 percent against an overall project target of 10 percent.  
The major crops supported under MOSAP were: maize, beans, cassava, and Irish potatoes. About 
66 percent of smallholder famers have adopted an improved technology promoted by the project 
against a project target of 30 percent. 
 
As indicated earlier, with the exception of cassava, the average yield of major crops cultivated in 
Angola, including maize, beans, Irish potatoes, is still extremely low, even compared to yields in 
other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. There is a large potential for increasing crop yields and 
agricultural production in the country. There are (at least) three major reasons justifying increasing 
public and private investments in the agriculture sector:  
 
(i) To ensure institutional continuity and scaling up of the on-going but limited support to 
smallholder farmers in Angola. As indicated, MOSAP has been critical in promoting agriculture 
recovery following the end of the civil war, strengthening institutions, and bringing formerly 
displaced agricultural producers back to agriculture in the project areas. 
(ii) To improve economic diversification. Angola possesses large and well-endowed natural 
resources including land and water. Almost two-thirds of the Angolans earn their livelihood from 
agriculture, a sector that could become one of the engines of economic growth and source of 
productive rural employment, provided capacity building and investments in public infrastructure 
and private assets take place. Unless investments are made to lay the foundations for future 
agricultural growth, national economic growth and diversification (which are critical in light of 
declining international oil prices), income, employment and foreign exchange earnings/savings will 
be seriously constrained.

(iii) To ensure sustainable use of natural resources.  Despite the low levels of economic activity, 
the country already faces various pressures on its natural resources, such as wastage of water and 
overuse of pastures and subsequent soil erosion (largely attributable to population pressures; 
desertification); and deforestation of tropical rain forest in response to both international demand for 
tropical timber and to domestic fuel use. Investments in an efficient use of water for irrigation and 
promotion of soil conservation techniques, including erosion control and enhancement of soil 
fertility, and natural resource management, will ensure a sustainable use of soil and water and will, 
over time, contribute towards mainstreaming climate smart agricultural practices.  
 
The proposed Smallholder Agriculture Development and Commercialization Project (SADCP) 
intends to scale-up activities being implemented under MOSAP and will also finance critical  new 
activities, as per government’s medium and long-term agriculture programs. MOSAP is scheduled 
to close on December 31, 2015, i.e. in eleven months.  The implementation of the new project is 
expected to start on January 1, 2016.  Given the popularity of MOSAP in the project areas as well as 
with agencies dealing with agriculture, government indicated preference for keeping the name of 
MOSAP and calls this project MOSAP-2.

Relationship to CAS
The Bank CPS for FY13-16 aims at (i) deepening diversification for inclusive growth; (ii) 
enhancing the quality of decentralization for services delivery; and (iii) building human resources 
capacity. The CPS recognizes the role of agriculture and the need to increase agriculture 
productivity and competitiveness to reduce rural poverty and promote growth. The proposed 
Smallholder Agriculture Development and Commercialization Project is a critical instrument to 
contribute to achieving the CPS objectives

II. Proposed Development Objective(s)
Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
The Project Development Objective is to increase smallholder agricultural production and 
marketing in the project areas.

Key Results (From PCN)
21. The proposed project is expected to provide assistance to about 200,000 smallholder 
farmers in three provinces. The key results expected from the proposed project are: (i) to increase 
yields of selected crops, including cassava, maize, beans and Irish potatoes to the average yield 
levels prevailing in sub-Saharan Africa; (ii) to increase production of selected crops; and (iii) to 
increase the share of crop production that is marketed. In addition to these key results indicators, the 
results framework will also measure intermediate performance indicators for each of the 
components that will be developed during project preparation. These indicators will include the 
percentage of farmers who benefit from training and apply their knowledge; the average yields of 
major crops supported by the project; the percentage of the agriculture produce marketed by the 
smallholder farmers in addition to other indicators that will be discussed and agreed upon during 
project preparation. 
  
22. The strategy to achieve key results under the proposed project is to build upon the outcomes 
achieved under the on-going MOSAP and support smallholder farmers to increase agricultural 
productivity, production and market linkages that generate self-sustaining agricultural growth over a 
larger project area, as compared to MOSAP.  This will be achieved by: (a) building on potential 
synergies with on-going agricultural programs; (b) maximizing opportunities for quick-win results

by focusing on farmers that received training under MOSAP or other programs and have applied 
their knowledge); (c) strengthening the knowledge and skills of smallholder farmers and their 
associations as well as of agricultural extension staff and agricultural services providers;  (d) re-
capitalizing productive agricultural systems and infrastructures, including irrigated agriculture; (e) 
providing access to demand-driven agricultural services and agricultural markets; and (f) promoting 
rural entrepreneurship in agri-business development. As far as possible, investments will be based 
on a flexible, participatory and demand-driven approach that promotes enhancement in productivity, 
commercialization and sustainability of agricultural activities.

III. Preliminary Description
Concept Description
The proposed project is designed to be climate smart, gender and jobs responsive and nutrition 
sensitive. The project is consistent with the main agriculture development programs in the country. 
Angola tends to experience seasonal rain variability and sometimes even long periods of drought 
that affect agricultural production. The proposed project will promote appropriate adaptation 
practices, including irrigated agriculture, to reduce such production losses. The project will support 
the participation of women in different project components, including farmers associations, 
production, marketing and training. The project will have a positive impact on employment and job 
creation in the rural areas by contributing to increased agricultural production, marketing, agri-
business and value addition as well as increased demand for agricultural inputs and services.  
Finally, since the project will promote the production of beans and vegetables, it is likely to have a 
positive impact on the food security and nutrition of rural households.  
 
The proposed project is a follow up project to the on-going MOSAP.  While broadly similar to the 
original MOSAP project, the new project differs in the following important aspects. First, it is larger 
in scope in terms of absolute funding and number of beneficiaries. Second, it includes a sub-
component to support the development of small-scale irrigated agriculture. Third, in addition to 
food crops (maize, cassava, beans and Irish potatoes), it will emphasize the production of high value 
crops, particularly horticulture. Fourth, it will further strengthen commercialization of agriculture, 
including market linkages, contract farming and agri-business development.  
 
The SADCP project area would cover the whole country for capacity building and institutional 
development activities. However, investment would be limited to the same provinces of Bie, 
Huambo and Malanje but with more coverage to municipalities. MOSAP was limited to three 
provinces covering 12 municipalities and only 50,000 beneficiaries. The proposed project would 
significantly expand the number of municipalities and communes covered under MOSAP and cover 
about 200,000 smallholder beneficiaries.  Besides the high potential for agricultural production, the 
selected provinces also meet the following criteria: 
 
• Well-endowed with resources, in particular land and water. Smallholder farming systems 
are already sustainable and profitable. Smallholder activities in these areas, before the civil war, 
included producing a wide range of crops, including most cereals and high value products such as 
vegetables (notably potatoes and onions). These areas appear to have high agricultural potential. 
 
• High concentration of rural population. The three provinces have around 52 percent of the 
population that is considered rural, as compared to 38 percent nationally. Overall, the three 
provinces account for about 24 percent of the rural population in Angola (2014 Population Census).

• Proximity to potential markets and possibility of benefiting from the rehabilitated road 
network and railways. Hopefully, this will facilitate the strengthening of market linkages and 
commercialization. 
 
The target groups of the project will be smallholders in the selected provinces with a potential to 
increase agricultural production and commercialization. The potential project beneficiaries will be d 
ivided into the following three categories: (i) Group 1 of 1,000 beneficiaries that are  likely to 
benefit from irrigated agriculture, production and marketing activities (primarily horticulture) with a 
possibility for contract farming; (ii) Group 2 of 49,000 beneficiaries that are  likely to benefit from 
production and marketing activities related to food crops and horticulture; and (iii) Group 3 of 
150,000 beneficiaries that are likely to benefit from capacity building, production and marketing 
related to key food crops. Specialized capacity development training may also be provided to 
beneficiaries in Groups 1 and 2 that may have also benefitted from capacity development under 
MOSAP. 
 
The proposed project will have three components: Component 1 - Capacity Building and 
Institutional Development; Component 2- Support for Agricultural Investment; and Component 3- 
Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation. The proposed project is expected to be 
implemented over a period of five years from January 2016 through December 2020. The total cost 
will be US$125 million, of which US$20 million will be contribution by the Government of Angola 
and US$5 million equivalent will be in-kind contribution by the beneficiaries. A 100 million IBRD 
loan will constitute the remainder of the total cost. Overall, the project is expected to support about 
200,000 beneficiaries (members of about 6,500 farmer associations) with approximately 300,000 ha 
cropped land (on an average, 1.5 ha per beneficiary and with a range of about 0.50 ha to 2.5 ha per 
beneficiary). 
 
 
Component 1. Capacity Building and Institutional Development (US$30 million) 
 
As under MOSAP, this component would focus on strengthening national, provincial and municipal 
institutions, develop technical capacity and introduce participatory processes to accelerate the 
decentralized agricultural development.  This component will also aim to strengthen the technical 
and managerial skills of participants and institutions involved in agricultural production and 
marketing in the project areas. This component entails the following four  sub-components:  
 
a. Formation and strengthening of Farmers’ associations, which would include organizational 
and managerial capacities, and technical skills related to modern agricultural technologies and 
agronomic practices, agricultural production, marketing, investment and entrepreneurship. Training 
of vulnerable groups (e.g. female-headed households) will be given special attention. This will also 
include training of farmers through farmers’ field schools (FFSs), as is being done under MOSAP. 
 
b. Institutional strengthening of local, provincial and national units of the Ministry of 
agriculture (MINAG) to ensure that these institutions can better play their respective roles in the 
sector.  This sub-component would include support for strengthening institutional capacity in 
agricultural extension services (including linkage with research), agricultural research service, small 
scale irrigation, agricultural marketing and agricultural statistics. In addition, the capacity of 
MINAG staff will be enhanced to prepare and implement appropriate agricultural programs and

policies. There will also be support for strengthening market information systems, linked to farmers’ 
and traders associations. Finally, the project will also support linkages with research programs 
relevant to agriculture that are being undertaken by the Ministry of Science and Technology.  
 
c. To strengthen agricultural research capacity and global knowledge about the latest 
technologies related to selected crops relevant to Angola, support to specific agricultural research 
will also be provided. Possible collaboration with both the International Institute for Tropical 
Agriculture (IITA) and the Brazilian Corporation of Agricultural Research (EMBRAPA) will be 
developed/further strengthened to address agricultural research and disease management issues that 
are critical for existing (cassava, maize and beans) and emerging crops (soybean) in Angola. As part 
of the CGIAR, IITA is responsible for carrying out research related to cassava, maize and beans in 
Africa. EMBRAPA has been working closely with Angola in building agricultural research 
capacity, including breeding for disease and pest resistance, in the context of integrated disease and 
pest management. 
 
d. Strengthening capacities of private and NGO agricultural service providers, especially those 
working closely with the smallholder farmers. Among other activities, this would include support 
for smallholder farmer groups or associations to prepare investment proposals for various sub-
projects for funding under the project as well as support for managerial and business capacities of 
new and existing agri-business entrepreneurs. 
 
Component 2. Support for Agricultural Investment  (US$55 million) 
 
This component supports investments in agriculture assets, both of a public as well as a private 
goods nature, with the aim to improve agricultural productivity, competiveness and market linkages 
of farmer beneficiaries (groups and individuals). The smallholder farmer beneficiaries will be re 
quired to make a small in-kind contribution (of at least 10 percent) to the investments that they 
receive based on criteria to be established during preparation. The investment component will, in 
the first year, consider farmer associations that received training under MOSAP. This component 
consists of the following sub-components:  
 
(a) Support for the Development of Small Scale Irrigation 
 
This sub-component will deal with the rehabilitation of existing and the development of new small 
scale irrigation systems. The Central Highlands, particularly comprising large parts of the provinces 
of Malanje, Huambo and Bie, have excellent conditions and water resources for development of 
small scale irrigated agriculture. Productive soils and water resources are abundant. Topographical 
conditions make it possible to develop irrigation by gravity. Gravity irrigation is particularly 
favorable for the development of small scale irrigated agriculture for smallholders. Some 
smallholder communities have already created and managed gravity irrigation schemes.  With their 
own resources (mainly labor and local materials) they derive water from small streams by 
(temporary) weirs to a network of unlined earthen canals for irrigation. The management and 
operation of these systems requires limited financial resources (the scarcest resources of 
smallholders). However, the efficiency and productivity of these systems will be improved by 
simple and cost-effective measures such as the construction of permanent weirs, the tubing and 
lining of canal stretches with infiltration losses, construction of culverts to cross roads and (natural) 
drainage streams etc.

(b) Support for Agricultural Production Investments 
 
This sub-component will support investments in farm assets. In order to access matching grants for 
investment sub-projects, farmer associations have to submit project proposals. This sub-component 
will assist eligible participants in the preparation of detailed proposals that will allow an informed 
decision about their feasibility from technical, economic, financial, social and environmental 
perspectives. The potential funding proposals (list will be finalized during preparation) will consider 
dealing with any activity that will increase crop productivity and production. Few examples are 
draft animals, simple tools and agricultural equipment, soil fertility/quality improvement, soil 
conservation, seeds of improved crop varieties, fertilizers and integrated pest and disease 
management. In addition, matching grants will also be provided to individual enterprises in the rural 
areas that will provide critical agricultural services to smallholders in the project areas.  
 
A review and evaluation of exist ing schemes will be carried out as part of the project preparation to 
help determine what kind of support might be needed and appropriate.  This assessment will also 
include on-going experiences and scope for the provision of rural financial services in Angola that 
are currently being provided by local and international NGOs. The main goal of this component is 
sustainable increase in agricultural production for the smallholders. 
 
(c) Support for Value Addition and Marketing Infrastructure  
 
This sub-component will support investments related to market linkages and commercialization, 
including value addition, post-harvest management and marketing activities for key crops and 
horticulture. The critical issues that need to be addressed are packaging, storage, small-scale 
processing, and marketing infrastructure and even contract farming. The main focus will be on 
value addition, reduction of post-harvest losses and market linkages. All sub-projects requesting 
financing under this sub-component will prepare a project proposal and a business plan that will go 
through a complete appraisal process to determine the economic feasibility and sustainability. 
Specific list of sub-projects that will be supported under this sub-component will be identified 
during preparation of the proposed project. 
 
Component 3: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$10 million) 
 
This component deals with coordination and monitoring and implementation of the project and 
consists of two sub-components: 
 
a. Project Management: 
The purpose of this sub-component is to ensure that the project is implemented correctly, on time 
and in accordance with the Loan Agreement. This would be the responsibility of a Project 
Coordinator and a small team of ex perts located at the national, and provincial or municipal levels. 
The final arrangements for project management will incorporate the lessons learned under MOSAP. 
  
b. Project Monitoring and Evaluation: 
 
The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system will be established that will be responsible for 
collecting and processing appropriate information to verify the output, effect and eventually the 
impact of project activities over time. Baseline information will also be collected at the beginning of 
the project.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

1. Côte d’Ivoire is a lower-middle-income economy with a widening urban/rural gap that hinders the 
achievement of shared prosperity and poverty elimination – With a population of 22.7m, the Gross National 
Income per capita (Atlas method) was US$ 1,420 in 2015, which is 13% lower than the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) 
regional average (US$ 1,637). Around 54% of its population lives in urban areas, and the population and the 
economy are highly concentrated around the economic capital Abidjan. Rural population in Cote d’Ivoire has 
increasingly suffered from poverty during the last 25 years

1
. Rural poverty has significantly increased since the 

end of the 1980s, and the rural/urban gap has widened. 57% of the rural population is below the national 
poverty line, whereas this rate is 21 percentage points lower for the urban population (36%) and the Northern 
regions are the most afflicted. The widening gap between the North and South of the country help explain why 
Côte d’Ivoire still stands at the 172

nd
 place in the world in the most recent global UNDP-HDI ranking (2016). The 

rural population suffered and still suffers from political crises, deterioration of governance and social services, 
and unstable revenues. At least three main challenges explain the increase in rural poverty over the past 25 
years: (a) political crises; (b) deterioration of governance and social services; and (c) unstable revenues. 

2. The country suffered from a period of civil war from 2002-2004, and a post-election crisis and armed conflict 
from late 2010 to April 2011, that disrupted the economic, social and political cohesion of the country – Côte 
d’Ivoire enjoyed decades of strong economic growth, but the country underwent a series of violent political 
and economic crises during 1999 to 2011 that led to a significant deterioration of living standards. The dismal 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rates during this period reflect the impact of the crises: on average -1.2% 
during 1999-2003 compared to 3.9% for SSA, 2.0% during 2003-2010 compared to 5.2% for SSA, and -4.4% for 
2011. However, since mid-2011, the country has made significant progress in consolidating political stability 
and post-crisis economic recovery has proceeded at a rapid and sustained speed. Sound macroeconomic 
management combined with public and private investments have underpinned improved economic growth: 
GDP growth rate is on average 9.5% during 2011-2015 (4.3% for SSA). 

3. The rural population has suffered from deterioration of governance and cuts in expenditures in social 
services as well as poor infrastructure – Since the political crises of the year 2000s, the rural population has 
suffered from a combined deterioration in: (i) the governance structure;

2
 and (ii) cuts in health and education 

expenditure under structural adjustment programs that aimed at reestablishing macroeconomic stability.
3
 The 

infrastructure gap between the more affluent urban areas and the poor rural areas is compelling: 33% of the 
urban population has access to improved sanitation facilities compared to 10% of the rural population; 88% of 
the urban population has access to electricity compared to 29% of the rural population.

4
 For ICT, 16% of 

households in urban areas has access to the internet compared to only 2% in rural areas.
5
 

4. Unstable revenues and poor productivity of the rural economy, especially for agriculture, hinders poverty 
reduction – The agriculture sector is an important driver of Côte d’Ivoire’s economy, accounting for 22% of GDP 
and more than 75% of exports. Three out of four working adults living in rural areas are employed by the

agriculture sector
6
. Despite its critical importance to the economy, the sector has had only a modest impact on 

income growth and poverty reduction in rural areas. The agriculture sector – and especially primary products – 
are highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices which in turn have an adverse and volatile impact on 
revenues for rural households. 

5. To tackle these challenges, the country has implemented reforms that have significantly contributed to an 
overall improvement in governance and the business environment, making the country more attractive to 
private investment – The country has been a relatively weak performer on the World Bank Ease of Doing 
Business Index DBI (global rank at 142

nd
 out of 189 countries in 2016

7
). Nevertheless, the business environment 

has improved significantly during the last five years – from 177
th

 in 2013 to 142
nd

 in 2016 based on DBI – 
making Cote d’Ivoire one of the ten fastest reforming countries two years in a row (2014 and 2015). The World 
Economic Forum (WEF) Global Competitiveness Index also capture this improvement, whereby Côte d’Ivoire 
rose from 131

st
 in 2012 to 91

st
 in 2015. The authorities will remain focused on improving crucial infrastructure, 

particularly in the energy and transport sectors, but increasing attention will turn to investment in 
communications infrastructure, as well as the education and healthcare system. They will continue to look 
abroad to finance much of the sizeable infrastructure investment that is underway. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

B.1 Rural economy and rural agriculture sectoral 

6. The rural economy is dominated by the agriculture sector, which is mostly made of: (i) export-oriented cash 
crops; and (ii) food crops and animal and fish production for domestic consumption – The cash crops subsector 
is made of cocoa, coffee, rubber, oil palm, cotton, and cashews. Cote d'Ivoire is the world's largest producer 
and exporter of cocoa beans and a significant producer and exporter of coffee and palm oil. Cash crops benefit 
from the bulk of agricultural investment and usually involve more sophisticated production techniques. Cash 
crops suffer from limited value chain integration among farmers, intermediaries and processors, which 
prevents the country from increasing downstream transformation of its food production. Cash crop agriculture 
is potentially lucrative, but it also entails considerable risk, as volatile international commodity markets 
determine export prices. The food crop subsector is made of plantains, yams, cassava, maize, rice, and 
livestock. It is characterized by traditional practices and receives little support from either the public or private 
sectors (except for rice and maize). The relatively strong performance of the food crop subsector is critical to 
food security in Côte d’Ivoire and has enabled the country to become self-sufficient in most key staple crops 
(except for wheat, rice and dairy). This subsector is often neglected in agricultural research and sector 
development strategies, and thus food production tends to be small-scale, traditional, and mostly informal. 
Nevertheless, prices of food crops are less impacted by international price volatility, and compared to cash 
crops often represent greater economic security but tend to offer more limited returns. 

7. The traditional food crops are mostly produced in the poorer Northern regions, whereas the cash crops are 
produced in the richer Southern regions – Adding to the North/South social and economic disparities, the 
country falls into two distinct agricultural regions: the dry savannah in the North and the forest region in the 
South. Rural poverty has traditionally been significantly higher in the North – where the potential for 
agriculture has not yet been realized – whereas the South benefits from higher and more reliable rainfall and 
better soils and produces most of the export crops. However, both the North and South suffer from low

agricultural productivity, high cost of inputs, considerable post-harvest losses, inadequate use of modern 
farming techniques, lack of modernization and mechanization, all contributing to a decline in agricultural 
production.

8
 

8. Rural economy, and especially rural agriculture, suffers from five gaps crippling economic productivity and 
related to: (i) Enabling environment; (ii) Access to land; (iii) Access to finance; (iv) Skills and technology; (v) 
Physical capital – Poor performance in agriculture undermines shared prosperity and poverty elimination, with 
five major gaps hindering the development of the rural agriculture sector:

9
 

a. Gap #1: Lack of accurate data and enabling environment gap – The agriculture sector lacks good and 
accurate data; for example, the latest available National Agricultural Census is now 16 years old (2001). The 
lack of accurate data hinders the elaboration and implementation of sound policies and strategies, and 
prevents the design and conduct of impact evaluation research.

10
 The agriculture sector also suffers from an 

inadequate national and foreign investment framework, and the sector is still severely disadvantaged by a 
distortive policy framework (taxes on export commodities), coupled with a strong urban bias in 
development spending. 

b. Gap #2: Access to land gap – Lack of access to land is a major cause of rural poverty in SSA, and Cote 
d’Ivoire is no exception. Small-scale producers of food crops have access to about half the amount of land 
available to large-scale producers of export crops and they suffer from low productivity because of the 
small size of their lands.

11
 The 1998 Law on Rural Land required farmers to register their land within ten 

years, but very few farmers had the knowledge, means, and skills to do so. A new Law in August 2013 
extended the deadline by ten years, and as of 2014 only 0.09% of the total agriculture land is registered (i.e. 
20k out of 23m hectares). Food insecurity risk is twice higher for farmers not owning property than for land 
owners

12
 and lack of land certificates is worse for women farmers who face additional gender-related 

constraints, including legal or social norms that prevent them from inheriting or simply owning land. 

c. Gap #3 – Access to finance gap – Cote d’Ivoire is one of the least developed countries in the region for rural 
development finance, and there is a lack of financing services for the agriculture sector. Access to credit by 
small farmers is acutely limited due to the virtual absence of financing structures such as rural microfinance 
institutions and rural banks. Moreover, private banks are reluctant to provide loans to rural small-scale 
farmers as they see them as cumulating too many risks: low levels of capitalization, unstable revenue flows, 
lack of formal credit history, difficulty in evaluating small farmers’ repayment capacity, lack of collateral 
such as titled land, the influence of exogenous factors such as weather conditions, and the limited legal 
avenues for enforcing contracts. Where credit is available, interest rates are often too high compared to the 
average rate of return of farmers’ investments. This translates into a low bank account ownership rate and 
a low percentage of adults having the possibility to benefit from a mortgage. The financing obstacle faced

Bank, Côte d’Ivoire SCD – From Crisis to Sustained Growth, 2015 (p.55-66). 
10

 Without much sector impact analysis, the sector has been subjected to ineffective policies including high indirect and direct taxes on export 
commodities which have prevented small farmers from earning more revenues: the 2015 World Bank SCD calculated that a 10 percent decrease 
in the export tax would boost net revenue by 22 percent, which in turn would improve the living conditions of roughly 4 million Ivoirians.  

11
 IFAD, Rural poverty in the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire, accessed in January 2016; World Bank, Côte d’Ivoire SCD – From Crisis to Sustained Growth, 
2015, (p.55): “Agriculture in Cote d’Ivoire is dominated by smallholder farmers, the majority of whom use traditional practices and rely on family 
labor. Data from the most recent Agricultural Census (2001) estimated that there are 8.3 million farmers nationwide, of whom 49 percent are 
women. The average cultivated area for each household is about 3.89 hectares, but 80 percent of households cultivate less than 2 hectares.” ().

by the agriculture sector in Cote d’Ivoire is thus similar to the rest of SSA: only about 1% of commercial 
lending in SSA goes to agriculture, mostly to large-scale farmers.

13
 

d. Gap #4 – Skills and technology gap – In 2011, 62% of teenagers in the Northwest region were unschooled 
compared to the national average of 42%, and only 8% of young people aged 15-24 completed their 
secondary education compared to the national average of 27%.

14
 The combination of low level of education 

and other gaps highlighted above (such as access to finance) leads to a low usage of technology and 
agriculture inputs – such as equipment and fertilizers. Several market failures characterize inputs markets, 
including: inconsistent rules and standards requirements, unrealistic standards, and lack of equipment and 
capacity at the rural level to ensure compliance. Moreover, the cost of technology and agriculture inputs for 
smallholders tend to be too high due to several factors

15
: (i) weak bargaining power of smallholders; (ii) 

poor transportation and energy infrastructure; (iii) lack of market information; (iv) lack of knowledge of 
farmers concerning the use of inputs; and (v) limited access to finance.  

e. Gap #5 – Physical capital gap – While several crops such as cashew (anacarde), maize and tomatoes are 
produced in the Northern regions,  principal markets  destinations are located in the Southern regions, 
including the port of Abidjan for exports and urban domestic markets which sometimes offer greater 
opportunities to smallholders than export markets

16
.: This implies that an efficient transportation network 

must be available throughout the whole territory to link production areas to: (i) the port of Abidjan 
international output market; and (ii) the domestic consumption areas spread around the country. Hence, 
having reliable infrastructures – such as road networks, storage facilities, electricity, and 
telecommunications – is essential to the efficiency of the agriculture sector. However, Cote d’Ivoire’s rural 
infrastructure needs additional investments to be rehabilitated and extended. Currently, as much as 90% of 
the paved network in Cote d’Ivoire is between 15 to 40 years old, while routes coatings are generally 
designed and built for a lifetime of 15 years

17
; as a consequence, about 40 percent of the road network is 

not or only partially useable.
18

 In addition to the lack of reliable roads, the lack of efficient public 
transportation services also hinders the economic development of rural agriculture: smallholders often use 
public transportation such as passenger buses to take their products to distant markets, and this 
inadequate transportation mode leads to bruising and damage to the products, thus reducing its quality 
and market value. The electricity network is no better as all departments of the Northern half of the 
country had coverage rates below the national average in 2011. Among them, five departments had less 
than 15% of their localities connected to electricity

19
. The lack of reliable electricity is an impediment to 

well-functioning rural markets as limited access to storage facilities and unreliable electricity supply result in 
post-harvest losses. Most farmers often rely on open-air storage and need to sell quickly their products – 
sometimes at a significantly low price – before it rots. 

9. Several public and private institutions drive the agriculture sector, generating a fragmented knowledge and 
negatively affecting the efficiency of the government’s action on the sector; the sector would thus strongly 
benefit from a stronger coordination for data and knowledge gathering, sharing, and dissemination – The

agriculture sector is jointly supervised by the Ministère de l’Agriculture et du Développement Rural (MINADER) 
and the Ministère des Ressources Animales et Halieutiques (MIRAH), with the strong implication of the 
Ministère des Eaux et Forêts (MINEFF) and the Ministère de l’Environnement et du Développement Durable 
(MINEDD). The MINADER and MIRAH both have their own internal statistics and planning department: the 
Direction Générale de la Planification, du Contrôle des Projets et des Statistiques (DGPPS, at MINADER) and the 
Direction de la Planification, des Statistiques et des Programmes (DPSP, at MIRAH). The MINADER and MIRAH 
also supervise – with other ministries – several public institutions in charge of agriculture and rural 
development, including the Agence Nationale d’Appui au Développement Rural (ANADER), the Centre National 
de Recherche Agronomique (CNRA), the Fonds Interprofessionnel pour la Recherche et le Conseil Agricole 
(FIRCA), the Office National de Développement de la filière Riz (ONDR), and the Office d’Aide à la 
Commercialisation des Produits Vivriers (OPCV). Several branches of agriculture also have their own 
organizations, including the Chambres d’Agriculture de Côte d’Ivoire, the Association Nationale des 
Organisations Professionnelles Agricoles de Côte d’Ivoire (ANOPACI), the Conseil Café Cacao (CCC), the 
Association des Professionnels de Caoutchouc Naturel de Côte d’Ivoire (APROMAC), etc. The sector would thus 
greatly benefit from a stronger coordination in data and knowledge gathering, sharing, and dissemination. 

10. To address the main gaps to fast and sustainable development of the agricultural sector, the Government has 
developed several strategies, including the National Agricultural Investment Program (NAIP) and the e-
Agriculture Strategy – The NAIP is the agricultural pillar of the country’s National Development Plan (NDP). The 
first NAIP (NAIP #1) was a US$4 billion program over the 2010-2015 period, aimed at promoting a diversified 
mix of strategic cash and food crops for growth and food security. It was organized around six programs: (i) 
crops productivity and competitiveness; (ii) development of agricultural supply chains; (iii) sector governance; 
(iv) capacity building; (v) sustainable management of fisheries; and (vi) rehabilitation of forest and wood 
industry. The government launch the update of the PNIA in October 2016 (PNIA #2) and the final release is 
expected in May 2017. The Government has also developed a comprehensive national e-Agriculture strategy in 
2012, and updated it in 2014. This strategy has the aim of modernizing the country’s agricultural sector and 
enhancing its productivity with an increase in the country’s export of cocoa, coffee and other produce, and a 
decrease in food imports. The strategy requires suitable access to information services and data centers as part 
of an ICT package aiming to make real-time market information systems available via mobile phones and 
tablets. Finally, other sectoral strategies include: (i) the Loi d’orientation agricole (Loi n° 2015-537 du 20 juillet 
2015); the Stratégie Nationale de Développement de la filière Riz 2012-2020 (SNDR); the Plan Stratégique de 
Développement de l’Elevage, de la Pêche et de l’Aquaculture (PSDEPA 2014-2020); the Stratégie Nationale de 
Développement de la Mécanisation Agricole (SNDMA); and the Programme National de Sécurisation du Foncier 
Rural (PNSFR). 

 
B.2 Digital economy sectoral and institutional context 

11. The ICT institutions and the enabling environment have drastically improved during the last five years thanks 
to the creation and revamping of key institutions and the introduction of new legal and regulatory 
frameworks – Overall, the ICT enabling environment has drastically improved during the last five years. Each 
year, the World Economic Forum (WEF) performs a global ranking of the ICT sector in each country by 
measuring the Network Readiness Index (NRI). One sub-index of the NRI is the ‘ICT Environment sub-index’ 
reflecting both the ‘Political and regulatory environment’ and the ‘Business and innovation environment’. In 
2012, Côte d’Ivoire ranked as one of the worst country in the world regarding the ‘ICT Environment sub-index’, 
being at the 130

th
 place (out of 142 countries). In less than 5 years, Côte d’Ivoire has risen at the 72

nd
 place (out 

of 139 countries) in 2016 for the ‘ICT Environment sub-index’ (on the overall Network Readiness Index, Côte 



 
The World Bank

d’Ivoire has risen from 122
nd

 to 106
th

 during 2012-2016): no other country monitored by the WEF has enjoyed 
such a drastic rank increase during the 2012-2016 period for the ‘ICT Environment sub-index’. 

12.  The major improvement of the international ranking of the ICT sector in Côte d’Ivoire is partly explained by 
several reforms lead by the five main institutions that drive and supervise the ICT sector – The Ministère de 
l’Economie Numérique et de la Poste (MENuP) is the Ministry in charge of the ICT and digital economy in Côte 
d’Ivoire, and the MENuP has revamped the telecom law in 2012.

20
 The legislation is now aligned with regional 

recommendations and covers major areas such as convergence, universal service, license and authorizations, 
relevant markets and market power, and consumer protection.

21
 The National Regulatory Authority (NRA) is 

the Autorité de Régulation des Télécommunications de Côte d’Ivoire (ARTCI),
22

 a fully-equipped NRA dealing 
with licensing, consumer protection, wholesale market regulation, and telecom spectrum management. The 
three main additional institutions are: (i) the Agence Nationale du Service Universel des Télécommunications 
(ANSUT) that ensures the implementation of universal service programs on behalf of the state and manage 
investment operations funded by the state in the field of ICT; the Agence Ivoirienne de Gestion des Fréquences 
radioélectriques (AIGF) focused on radio frequency management; and (iii) the Société Nationale de 
Développement Informatique (SNDI), a state-owned company under the supervision of the Prime Minister, in 
charge of Information Technology and Information System projects for the Government.

23
 

13. Although the ICT sector, and especially the mobile sector, is performing well in Côte d’Ivoire, it has mostly 
benefited the affluent urban and educated population – The ICT sector in Cote d’Ivoire has consistently 
expanded during the last few years; it generated a total revenue of 982.5 billion FCFA in 2013 (US$ 1.6 billion), 
contributed to 8% of the country’s GDP, and provided around 5,400 direct jobs and 100,000 indirect jobs.

24
 The 

recent performance of mobile service (voice and SMS) in Côte d’Ivoire has been buoyant, driven by a healthy 
competition among the three main mobile operators (Orange, MTN, and Moov). The mobile connection 
penetration (number of total SIM divided by total population) reached 113% at the end of 2015, compared to 
88% for West Africa region and 77% for Sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 1). Despite these robust mobile service 
performances an important share of the population is still offline. As of 2014, only 4% of interviewed 
individuals stated that they have an internet access at home compared to an average of 12% for SSA (Gallup 
survey). The World Bank indicator ‘Internet users’ (percentage of the population that have used the internet – 
from any location and with any type of device – during the last 12 months) show that only 21% of the 
population of Cote d’Ivoire has accessed internet at least once during the previous 12 months in 2015, 
compared to an average of 22% for SSA and 29% for lower-middle-income countries (Figure 2). Moreover, the 
use of internet – mostly through mobile broadband, as fixed broadband connectivity is marginal – is 
concentrated in the most affluent, educated and urban population centers. 15% of the Cote d’Ivoire urban 
population uses internet on a weekly basis, but this rate drops to only 3% for the rural Cote d’Ivoire population 

                                            
20

 Until 2012 the main legislation covering the telecommunication sector was the Law No. 95-526 of 7 July 1995 (Code des Télécommunications); as 
this legislation was outdated, it was fully revamped by the Ordonnance n° 2012-293 of 21 march 2012. 

21
 Moreover, the Government has introduced a tax break for the ICT sector in August 2015 with a VAT exoneration and reduced custom duties for 
ICT and electronic equipment, and this measure should last until the end of 2018 (cf. Abidjan.net, Les prix des ordinateurs, tablettes, téléphones 
portables vont baisser en Côte d’Ivoire, November 2015). 

22
 The ARTCI was created in 2013 by merging two institutions, the previous Agence des Télécommunications de Cote d’Ivoire (ATCI) – in charge inter 
alia of telecom spectrum management, licensing, and wholesale pricing – and the Conseil des Télécommunications de Côte d’Ivoire (CTCI) – in 
charge inter alia of monitoring the market competition dynamics, ensuring the compliance with the license obligations, and solving litigations. 

23
 In 2011, the Government adopted the e-GOUV scheme, which consists of two major axes – e-Administration and e-Services. The SNDI is working 
to implement ICT solutions in all government activities, including finance, health care, and education, with the goal of providing, by the year 
2020, all government services available online in developed countries (cf. IDAL, ICT Ivory Coast market, 2015, p.6).

on a weekly basis compared to 19% for those having reached at least a secondary education level (Figure 4).

14. On the supply side, there are significant mobile coverage gaps for rural areas – The regulator ARTCI has 
identified that 48% of the 8,518 localities (localités) in Côte d’Ivoire were not covered by any mobile service; 
the uncovered localities represent 23% of the total population. Mobile operators have confirmed that they 
reached their profitability frontier and that extending their coverage would not be sufficiently profitable at this 
stage due to: (i) the lower population density in rural areas which increases the Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) per 
subscriber; and (ii) the lower purchasing power of subscribers which drives down the Average Revenue Per 
User (ARPU). Mobile broadband coverage with 3G is even worse, with coverage maps showing vast swaths 
without any coverage (. To counter this market failure, the ANSUT is currently deploying a national 7,000 km 
long fibre backbone to cover rural areas, and ARTCI is elaborating a “white zone” program to increase rural 
coverage. However, this will be insufficient to achieve mobile broadband coverage for all as the number of 
mobile sites should be at least tripled: each operator has deployed between 1,600 and 2,000 mobile sites in 
Côte d’Ivoire, a relatively low number compared to European countries that achieved acceptable level of 
coverage and services (in Romania, a country that is 30% smaller in area and with a similar population size, the 
regulator calculated that 6,000 sites were required to cover 99% of the population).

Relationship to CPF 
 

15. The proposed project is designed to contribute to the World Bank Group’s twin goals of ending extreme 
poverty and boosting shared prosperity – The project will help the country achieve the twin objectives through 
promoting agricultural growth which is inclusive of smallholder farmers. The proposed project is consistent 
with the Bank’s CPF (FY16-FY19), and especially with ‘Focus Area One: Accelerating sustainable private sector‐
led growth’ which comprises four objectives that the project will directly or indirectly support. 

16. The e-agriculture project will directly contribute to two objectives of the CPF regarding (i) agriculture and (ii) 
infrastructure – (i) The project will contribute to ‘Objective #1: Improve Productivity in Agriculture/Agribusiness 
Value Chains’. Unpredictable weather patterns, unreliable pricing information and crop failure due to diseases 
are a few of the issues that digital services could tackle in Côte d’Ivoire. The project will directly support the 
objective of improving productivity by promoting digital solutions that will: (a) empower smallholder farmers to 
access information and markets, leading to increase in productivity and sales, and reduction in post-harvest 
loss; and (b) enable public institutions to collect and gather agricultural and rural statistics to drive public policy 
and strategy. (ii) The project will also contribute to ‘Objective #2: Strengthen Economic Infrastructure’. By 
extending ICT connectivity in rural areas, the project will directly enhance digital infrastructure and provide 
workarounds to inadequate logistics services. This will positively impact rural agriculture and economy by 
enabling easier access to consumer markets at competitive costs.

17. The project will also indirectly contribute to two objectives of the CPF regarding (i) business environment and 
(ii) access to land – (i) ‘Objective #3: Improve Business Regulatory Framework and Access to Finance’ will be 
supported by extending the reach of ICT connectivity and facilitating the digitization of economic transactions. 
The spreading of ICT will support both: (a) the increase in mobile banking usage; and (b) the promotion of 
private sector growth with the ability for smallholders to get a credit with traditional banks thanks to a track 
record on which their financial performance can be assessed. (ii) ‘Objective #4: Formalize and Enhance 
Regulatory Access to Land for Business and Agriculture’ will also be supported thanks to the development of ICT 
platforms providing cheap and reliable tools to register land and deliver land certificates. Enhancing the 
registering process of land is fundamental to improve land security and support informed land transactions for 
both smallholders and private investors, and are a prerequisite for shared growth.  

18. The proposed project will leverage ongoing Bank operations in Côte d’Ivoire – The Bank has also been 
supporting the country’s agricultural strategy implementation through the sub-regional West Africa Agricultural 
Productivity Program (WAAPP), which is being implemented in 13 countries of the Economic Community of 
West African States (ECOWAS). The development objective of the Program is to generate and accelerate the 
adoption of improved technologies in the participating countries’ top agricultural commodity priority areas that 
are aligned with the sub-region’s top agricultural commodity priorities, as outlined in the Economic Community 
of West Africa Agriculture Program (ECOWAP). Other development partners such as the International Fund for 
Agriculture Development (IFAD), FAO, the African Development Bank (AfDB) and others have been 
implementing similar projects in support of the sector strategy. 

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 

 
 
To improve access to affordable broadband in rural communities and leverage electronic platforms to improve farm 
productivity and access to markets. 

 
Key Results (From PCN) 

 

19. The key results expected from the proposed project are: 

a. Coverage of ICT services is significantly increased in targeted areas, and ICT usage (voice, SMS, and internet 
access) is significantly increased in targeted areas for local public and administrative institutions, 
businesses, and population – including vulnerable population (women); 

b. Digital solutions for rural development are made available, with electronic platforms being operational and 
used by: (i) public administrative services in charge of monitoring and informing rural development policies; 
and (ii) end users such as smallholders. 

c. As a result of increased use of digital solutions, smallholders in targeted area benefit from an increase in: (i) 
yields of selected crops (volume of production per ha or per smallholder); (ii) volume of sales of selected 
crops; and (iii) the reduction in postharvest losses by selected producer organizations supported by the 
project.

20. The Project will assess the number of ‘beneficiaries’ with a breakdown between both individuals (disaggregated 
by gender) and establishments (disaggregated by central public administrations, local government and public 
administrations, and local businesses). The project will use the following PDO indicators: 

a. Number of beneficiaries accessing mobile communication services (voice and SMS); 

b. Number of beneficiaries accessing the internet; 

c. Share of production of target crops marketed by selected smallholders supported by the project; 

 
 
D. Concept Description 

 

21. To achieve the Project Development Objectives, the proposed project follows an integrated transformational 
solutions approach with three components: 

a. Component #1 ICT Infrastructure – Extending the coverage of ICT services in rural areas, and thereby 
improving the number of individuals, public administrations, and businesses that will be able to access both 
mobile services (voice and SMS) and the internet to improve productivity; 

b. Component #2 Digital services for rural development – Stimulating the development of digital services for 
rural development (with an emphasis on e-Agriculture), improving public service delivery in rural areas, and 
encouraging development of local content, applications, and services, through the setting up of electronic 
platforms and the creation of business incubators; 

c. Component #3 Project implementation – Project management, coordination, monitoring, and evaluation. 

22. Component 1 ICT Infrastructure – Component 1 will contribute to achieving the PDO by increasing coverage of 
ICT services. The coverage increase will be done through a subsidy to investment in connectivity. Depending on 
the targeted region and community, the PPP model will be adjusted. Among the public subsidy options, and 
based on ad hoc economic analysis, the project will subsidize: (i) the rollout of a Radio Access Network (RAN) 
mobile infrastructure focused on passive elements (i.e., towers and energy solutions). The towers will be 
sufficiently dimensioned to ensure that all mobile operators in Côte d’Ivoire can use the passive RAN to install 
their own active elements (i.e. base stations and transmitters) to improve coverage of their network and 
provide voice, SMS, and data services to the offline population; and (ii) the rollout of backhaul segments. The 
fiber optic links will be deployed either through OPGW when available, or buried along roads to points closer to 
the targeted communities. The private operators will then deploy the last mile (e.g. RAN). Because this 
component implies the subsidy of an ICT infrastructure, the identification of target areas (where the passive 
RAN will be deployed) and project design (how they will be deployed) will comply with a set of criteria in line 
with international best practices to maximize “value for money” and support the overarching twin goals of 
shared prosperity and poverty elimination (cf. below Section B). 

23. Regions identified as priority for Component 1 through the selection criteria – Three districts have been 
identified by the client as priority for component 1: (i) District of Denguélé; (ii) District des Savanes; (iii) and the 
Bounkani Region (District of Bouna). These three district are particularly affected by low connectivity and 
productivity issues (see Figure 5 & Figure 6 above). 

24. Component 2 Digital services for rural development – Component 2 will contribute to achieving the PDO with 
two sub-components: 



 
The World Bank  
Digital Solutions for Sustainable Development (P160418) 

 
 

  
Mar 31, 2017 Page 13 of 17  

     

a. Sub-component 2.1 – Help improve the performance of the rural development public institutions in Côte 
d’Ivoire in gathering relevant, detailed, and recent data to monitor the rural economy and assist in shaping 
public policy; 

Sub-component 2.2 –Provide digital solutions to smallholders for selected crops that will increase crop 
yields, increase volumes of sales, reduce post-harvest loss, and improve market linkages. To that effect, a 
comprehensive program of activities will be implemented under this component that will be geared at: (i) 
improving the outreach and quality of crop extension and advisory services by strengthening the skills of 
public extension workers, promoting ICT in agricultural extension services, and supporting farmer-to-
farmer extension; (ii) developing farmers’ skills to scale-up the dissemination of Good Agricultural Practices 
(GAPs); and (iii) fostering the emergence of a digital innovation ecosystem aimed at providing local content, 
applications, and services for rural development through the creation and leveraging of e-Government 
platforms. The project will specifically aim at incubators and local labs training young women in 
coding/programming, as well as entrepreneurship in general. 

25. Regions and value-chains identified as priority for Component 2 through the selection criteria – Value-chains 
identified by the Ministry of Agriculture as priorities (with an emphasize on staple food) for this component 
are: (a) maze, manioc, rice; (b) plantain, yam (igname); and (c) poultry. Taking into account the regions where 
these value-chains are predominant, the component will target the following districts and regions: regions 
already included in Component 1 – District of Denguélé, District des Savanes, and the Bounkani Region (District 
of Bouna) – plus the District of Sassandra-Marahoué, and the District of Gôh-Djiboua. These crops fall to a large 
extent under the informal agriculture sector. Producers and farmers for these crops are predominantly women.

26. Component #3 Project implementation – This Component will support the setting up of a dedicated Project 
Implementation Unit (PIU) and will also cover training, office equipment, operating costs, audits and

communications as well as Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E), environmental and social studies, their 
implementation and/or the monitoring of their implementation. 

 

 
 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
In terms of infrastructure, the project will target exclusively the three Districts of the northern part of the country: 

District of Denguélé, District of Savanes, and District of Bouna. As part of component 1, the project will finance the 
construction of towers (passive infrastructure) and/or bury fiber optic links. In the case of fiber optic , the fiber will be 
buried along roads or railways, or installed on the ground cable of power lines. Therefore, the fiber optic infrastructure 
will be installed along existing infrastructure, with negligible impact on the environment and the population. Regarding 
the towers, some towers may be installed on private properties depending on the site and expected coverage. However, 
it is again expected that the installation of towers will have negligible impact on the environment, and minimal impact on 
the neighboring communities. Analysis will be carried out on a case by case basis. For the second component project will 
be implemented in the following areas: (i) District of Denguélé; (ii) District des Savanes; (iii) the Bounkani Region (District 
of Bouna); (iv) District of Sassandra-Marahoué; (v) and the District of Gôh-Djiboua 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
There are considerable legal and institutional frameworks in the country to ensure compliance with World Bank 

safeguards policies triggered by the proposed project. In Cote d’Ivoire, the Ministry of Sanitation, Environment, and 
Sustainable Development (MINSEDD) is responsible for setting policy guidelines on environmental issues and ensuring 
compliance with national environmental standards. It has different departments among which the National Agency of 
Environment (ANDE, Agence Nationale de l’Environnement) in charge of safeguards compliance of all projects in the 
country. The unit is well staffed and its capacities are acceptable. Based on the preliminary borrower assessment, the 
Agency (ANDE) has sustained resources to carry out the oversight of the safeguards performance during implementation. 
With regard to the PIU, capacity building efforts to support project implementation will be done by implementing 
recommendations contained in the safeguards instruments prepared for the project. The project will also receive 
guidance from the Bank’s environmental and social specialists in the Project team.

infrastructures and the deployment of fiber optic. 
These constructions may entail potential adverse 
impacts on the environmental components. However, 
as the exact locations of those activities are unknown 
to date, an Environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF) will be developed, reviewed, 
consulted upon and disclosed both within Cote 
d’Ivoire and at the World Bank’s Website prior to the 
Decision meeting. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No 
The project activities will not be implemented in areas 
hosting natural habitats. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 
The project will not support activities related to forest 
exploitation or management or might have potential 
adverse impacts on forested areas. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 No The project does not involve pest management 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

Activities supported by the ongoing bank’s funded 
operation such as the construction of towers, ICT 
infrastructures and the deployment of fiber optic will 
unquestionably involve excavations with possibilities 
to discover Physical cultural resources. However, the 
triggering of this policy does not entail the preparation 
of a specific safeguard instrument. Only a specific 
chapter will be included in the ESMF to provide 
guidance in case physical cultural resources will be 
discovered. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
The Project location does not cover Indigenous 
Peoples as defined by the World bank 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

These planned interventions are not expected to lead 
to significant land acquisition or significant restriction 
of access to sources of livelihood. However, the 
implementation of the pools or antenna my lead to 
lands acquisition. Therefore, a Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) will be prepared for the activities 
triggered by the OP 4.12  as a due diligence given that 
the specific sites or impacts of envisioned physical 
investments are not known, The  Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) consistent with OP 4.12 will be 
prepared by the Borrower, reviewed and cleared by 
the team and disclosed in-country and at Bank 
InfoShop prior to appraisal. The RPF will be used as a 
guide to conduct specific Resettlement Action Plans 
(RAPs) as needed, as they relate to land acquisition 
and loss of economic activities issues, as well as 
compensation measures to minimize negative impacts 
on Project Affected People (PAPs).

Appraisal Review Decision 
(from Decision Note)

I. Project Context
Country Context
Tanzania has been experiencing high rates of economic growth. This growth has been driven by 
economic liberalization, sound macroeconomic policy management, and expanding public sector 
spending. Growth accelerated from an average of 3.5 percent during the 1990s to around 7 percent 
over the past decade.  Improvements in tax administration and provision of foreign aid created 
space for a significant expansion in public spending, which increased from less than 16 percent of 
GDP in 2000 to almost 28 percent in 2011. Inflation was low from 2000 to 2005, but picked up 
pace from 2006 to 2011. It was briefly in double digits, and has now settled back to around 7 
percent. Fiscal policy has been largely prudent accompanied by strong growth in tax revenues.  
However, the government needs to keep its debt and debt service to reasonable levels, reduce the 
growing deficits of certain parastatals, and manage the commitments under the public pension 
scheme. There are a number of recent developments (including discovery of natural gas) that are 
expected to contribute to Tanzania’s positive economic performance. Looking forward, the 
economy is likely to remain on its current growth trajectory in the near future.

Notwithstanding the country’s solid economic growth record, poverty rates have not declined 
significantly. In November 2013, the government announced the new official poverty figures. The 
basic needs poverty level in Tanzania mainland has fallen from 33.34 percent in 2007 to 28.2 
percent in 2012. Rural poverty has declined from 39.4 percent to 33.4 percent over the same period. 
Despite impressive macro-fiscal performance, and decades of concerted efforts to lift rural masses 
out of poverty, agricultural incomes have grown slowly. Economic growth has been concentrated in 
urban areas and in capital-intensive sectors, such as the mining, communication, construction, and 
banking sectors. In comparison, the growth in agricultural value added has been less than two 
percent per worker. This growth in the agriculture sector has not been high enough to reduce 
poverty in rural areas, where more than 80 percent the country’s poor reside.  
Limited opportunities for commercialization are at the heart of small farmers’ problems in 
Tanzania. The majority of smallholder farmers sell little of their production. Approximately three 
quarters of all maize, and approximately half of all paddy, is consumed within the village in which 
it is produced. The expansion of smallholder production of these food crops, as well as a range of 
cash crops such as cotton, tea and coffee is undermined by low productivity, and high transport and 
marketing costs. New strategies for agricultural commercialization are needed. 
The top leadership of the country is strongly committed to share prosperity more widely, and 
recognizes the economic importance of agriculture for rural growth and poverty alleviation. The 
government at the highest levels has made transformation of agriculture a major national priority. 
Learning from the experience of other countries, the Tanzanian government has embarked on an 
ambitious program to strengthen agriculture value chains and integrate larger numbers of small-
scale farmers into these competitive trade partnerships. These initiatives target the transformation of 
large numbers of semi-subsistence producers to become successful commercial farmers. There is a 
market failure in service provision to these smallholders to enable them to link up with modern 
agriculture value chains (which enables them to acquire modern technologies and markets; and 
learn by doing); hence government is committed to correcting this market failure by incentivizing 
agribusinesses through matching grants. The matching grants would help underwrite the risks 
agribusinesses face in bringing in more smallholders into their value chains, and smallholders 
would gain from the experience of more targeted modern services and improved markets for their 
output.

  

Sectoral and institutional Context
Tanzania has witnessed an expansion in agribusiness investment with supply chain links with 
smallholder farming. A growing number of these agribusinesses are pursuing contract or out-
grower farming with smallholders. These include investments in out-grower sugar, tobacco cotton, 
sorghum, barley, cocoa, dairy and horticultural crops. Agribusinesses are experimenting with 
alternative strategies for strengthening this co-investment. 
 
The Government of Tanzania (GoT) recognizes that the private sector is a critical partner in 
delivering development benefits. Particularly when it is linked to smallholder production potential, 
it can provide an important engine of agricultural growth. In 2001, the government adopted a new 
Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS) targeting achievement of a green revolution in 
agriculture. To better implement this strategy, the government then prepared the Agricultural Sector 
Development Program (ASDP), highlighting the need for stronger public-private partnership to 
promote the commercialization of smallholder production. This commitment was reinforced in 
2009 with the signing of the Kilimo Kwanza (Agriculture First) resolution calling for greater 
investment in agriculture, and inclusive commercialization.

The Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT) Program was developed by the 
GoT to operationalize the Kilimo Kwanza. The SAGCOT Program, as articulated in its core 
document, the Investment Blueprint, highlights commitment to a strategy of joint public-private 
investment targeting the development of agribusiness value chains across the country’s southern 
corridor. In aggregate, the Blueprint proposes that a public investment of USD1.3bn can leverage 
an additional USD2.1bn in private investment in order to bring 350,000ha of agricultural land into 
commercial production over the next twenty years. Tens of thousands of smallholders are expected 
to become successful commercial farmers, more than two million people are to be lifted out of 
poverty and food security will improve. The primary emphasis of the SAGCOT Program is to 
expand partnerships between agribusinesses and smallholder farmers in building larger and more 
competitive value chains.   Agribusiness investors are sought who are willing to work 
collaboratively with smallholder communities to raise productivity and incomes. Early successes 
have been highlighted for sugar and rice, where out-growers have achieved higher levels of 
productivity and income compared with smallholders in neighboring regions. Similar examples are 
cited for tea and horticultural crop farmers.

II. Proposed Development Objectives
To support the adoption of new technologies and improved market access by small-holder farmers 
through expanding and creating partnerships between small-holder farmers and agribusinesses in the 
Southern Corridor of Tanzania.

Total 75.00

V. Implementation
The Project will be overseen by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). A Project Steering Committee 
(PSC) meeting quarterly and on specific demand has been established. It is chaired by the 
Permanent Secretary (PS) of the PMO, and amongst others comprises PS from key line ministries, 
the Chief Executive Officers of the TIC, SAGCOT Centre, SAGCOT Catalytic Trust Fund (CTF), 
Rufiji Basin Development Authority (RUBADA), and representatives from smallholder farmers. 
The PSC will: (a) ensure coordination and cooperation among all participating agencies; and (b) 
endorse annual work plans and budgets for all project-related activities. 
 
The PMO has proposed that the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) originally created for the IDA 
funded Private Sector Competitiveness Project be expanded to also coordinate the SAGCOT 
Investment Project. This PCU will have management oversight and reporting responsibilities for all 
components of the Project. This entity will integrate the financial and technical progress reports 
from each of the agencies being funded, and carry out the overall M&E for the Project. The PCU 
will also take overall procurement and financial management responsibility during the first six to 12 
months of the Project implementation until sufficient capacity has been built in the other 
implementing agencies (an assessment will be undertaken to assess the agencies capacity). The full 
staffing of this PCU as set out in the Operational Manual. All participating institutions will prepare 
annual work plans and budgets to be submitted to the PCU for approval by the PSC. 
 
IDA financing agreed with the Ministry of Finance that will flow to agencies other than the PCU, 
will be governed by subsidiary agreements acceptable to IDA (these agencies are the SAGCOT 
Centre and the SAGCOT Catalytic Trust Fund). These subsidiary agreements lay out the fund flow, 
implementation and reporting requirements of the two entities. Direct funding to these entities may 
only begin once these subsidiary agreements, and an associated set of fiduciary systems including 
financial management and procurement systems acceptable to IDA, are in place. It is estimated that 
this will take place in the first year of implementation. 
 
The SAGCOT Centre will be the responsible implementing agency for sub-component 1.1 activities. 
Funding for the SAGCOT Centre will be committed in parallel with other Development Partners 
(initially DfID and USAID) to support the operations of the Centre as a whole. A Memorandum of

Understanding (MoU) has been signed on September 30, 2014 between the SAGCOT Centre, GoT, 
DfID, the World Bank, Norway, EU, and UNDP. The MoU states that the funding will be 
committed against an indicative five year budget, and against an approved annual budget agreed by 
the SAGCOT Centre Board.  
 
TIC will be the responsible implementing agency for sub-component 1.2 activities.  The TIC will 
directly implement these activities and be responsible for procurement, financial management, 
input/output and progress reporting.  In the first instance, procurement under the Project will be 
implemented by the PCU until such time as TIC has reinforced its procurement capacity. 
 
Component 2 will be implemented through the SAGCOT Catalytic Trust Fund. The institutional 
structure of the catalytic fund management is designed and specified in a Trust Deed. A Board 
comprising five members has been established. The Board has recruited an Executive Secretary and 
initiated recruitment of a Fund Manager, estimated to be selected soon after the approval of the 
Project.   
 
The grant application process under the Matching Grant Fund (MGF) will be managed by a 
professional and competitively recruited Fund Manager. The Fund Manager will periodically (at 
least twice a year) invite applications from eligible partnership between smallholders and 
established agribusinesses, and through a two phased process select those applications which satisfy 
the core criteria (benefits to smallholders, safeguard compliance, sustainability, etc.). The Fund 
Manager will have a specific duty to provide support to applicants, in particular to help ensure 
benefit flows to smallholders, and that smallholder interests are well represented in the application 
and the partnership. The final applications will be submitted to the independent Investment 
Committee to be appointed by the Board to review all grant proposals and make recommendations 
to the Board on those that warrant funding. The eligibility, selection process and implementation 
arrangements are detailed in the Trust Deed and further specified in the MGF Operational Manual. 
Grants will be funded on a reimbursement basis with expenses pre-financed by the investors and 
may be tranched. Grants payments made through the agribusiness may be allocated to the 
agribusiness investor, smallholders or some combination thereof, as requested in the application, 
and set out in the grant agreement.

B.   Introduction and Context

Country Context
Between 2010 and 2014, the overall economy grew at 7.7 percent and the extractive industry 
grew at 25 percent , making the DRC one of Africa's fastest growing economies. Extractive 
industry exports account for about 95 percent of DRC➢❨ s exports.  While mining revenues have 
contributed to strong macroeconomic growth and poverty reduction, high export concentration 
exposes the country to exogenous shocks and instability .  The recent trends of falling world 
commodity prices, lower export revenues, and the associated slow-down in DRC➢❨ s mining 
sector have contributed to a tight fiscal environment. In this context, the government has placed 
significant priority to economic diversification and has identified the Agriculture sector, 
DRC➢❨ s second biggest sector- as a key sector for expanding its export base and buffering the 
economy against oil price shocks. 
 
Despite high rates of macroeconomic growth, poverty and malnutrition remains widespread in 
DRC.  The national poverty rate is 64 percent, with poverty rates only slightly higher in rural 
areas (65 percent) relative to urban areas (62 percent). Almost one quarter of children are 
underweight. In rural areas, deficiencies in food storage and market access create seasonal food 
shortages. In urban areas, import tariffs (commonly 10 percent) and low domestic production, 
thus requiring sizable food imports, result in food prices that are amongst the highest in Africa.  
About six million people are classified as food insecure in the country. 
 
Climate change will exacerbate droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events. Although the 
Congo basin seems to be less exposed than dryer parts of Africa, Congolese farmers are 
particularly poor and isolated, therefore vulnerable to climate impacts and other external shocks. 
 
In addition, DRC is undergoing a process of decentralization. Last year, the number of provinces 
officially grew from 11 to 26. Equateur Province, where PARRSA is located, has been sub-
divided into five new Provinces, three of them falling under the project area (Sud Ubangi, Nord 
Ubangi, and Mongala). Within the decentralization process, the provincial services of the 
ministries are being revitalized to better serve the rural population. However, some new provinces 
lack the structures and fiscal resources to function independently. Consequently there is a need for 
new investments, including agriculture investments, to make these new provinces more fiscally 
secure. 
 
Socio-Political System. Following the African Union led dialogue, the 2016 elections were 
postponed and a second more inclusive dialogue led by the Conference Episcopale Nationale du 
Congo (CENCO) is still underway but has already achieved an agreement for a new government 
of national unity and a commitment from the President to not run for a third term. Presidential 
elections are expected to be held in December 2017, but this date has been viewed as not credible. 
The majority of the provinces are under-resourced (human and financial) and ill equipped. As a 
result, the majority of the provinces have increased taxes in order to cover their operational costs. 
Democratic process in the DRC faces a myriad of challenges, including a legacy of exploitation 
and conflict, lack of physical and communications infrastructure, extreme poverty and continuing 
pockets of insecurity.

Governance system, conflict and institutional fragility. The factors blocking an economic 
development in the country include: (a) a crisis resulting from contested 2011 election results; (b) 
weak governance; and (c) the weakness of state institutions in implementing appropriate policies. 
As a result, the agricultural sector is operating in an environment of fragile socio-political context, 
low quality human capacity with an outdated skills base, an unattractive business environment, 
rent based economy with low agricultural productivity, dilapidated infrastructure and under 
developed service markets (agricultural inputs, logistics services, financial services). 
 
Enabling environment and tax burden. The macroeconomic indicators for the country have 
remained relatively stable with annual inflation stable at 1.6 percent over the past 5 years. Real 
interest rates have remained at about 17 percent. This is illustrative of a business enabling 
environment which is characterized by: (i) high import taxes; (ii) high sales taxes; (iii) unofficial 
taxes levied across road, rail, river and air transport; (iii) high port handling fees; (iii) unreliable 
electricity supply; (iv) corruption; (v) ➢❨ red tape➢❨  bureaucratic procedures that make it more 
costly to close a transaction or sell a product; and (vi) very high logistical hurdles and costs. In 
addition, the agricultural sector has outdated laws and regulations on seed, land, food quality and 
control. Because of poor transport infrastructure, it is much harder to reach markets and the net 
effect is reduced competitiveness of domestically produced products in local, national and 
regional markets. Under-developed input markets and fragmented value chains further reduce the 
competitiveness of locally produced commodities, but itpresents opportunities for private 
investors.
Sectoral and institutional Context
Agriculture currently accounts for about 20 percent of GDP and employs some 70-75 percent of 
the economically active population. Related agro-industries employ another 10 percent of the 
population. Jobs in agriculture tend to be informal, with low value added per worker (US$227/
year ), often providing only for subsistence. Agriculture and other sectors are hampered by the 
fact that DRC is recovering from more than 15 years of civil war, which has created serious 
infrastructure and institutional vacuums. The country faces systematic challenges in its business 
environment and enabling services such as rural connectivity, power infrastructure, and extension 
systems. Public spending is constrained by weak budgetary processes, inefficiencies, and poor 
coordination. 
 
The Government➢❨ s objective is to reduce rural poverty by 2020 by restoring and modernizing 
agricultural production systems, improving nutrition and food security, and mobilizing significant 
public and private sector investments. In recent years, agriculture has become a top priority for 
DRC Government as evidenced by the allocation of 8 percent of total budget in 2016 (up from 3 
percent) in line with the Africa Heads of State Maputo Declaration. The 2013 Programme 
National d➢❨ Investissements Agricoles (PNIA), with a total estimated cost of US$5.7 billion 
over seven years, builds upon five pillars: (i) fostering value chains and agribusiness; (ii) 
achieving food security; (iii) enhancing research, extension, and training; (iv) improving sector 
governance, gender participation and institutional capacity; and (v) adapting to climate change. In 
2014, the Government launched the agro industrial park strategy to boost agribusiness and 
agroindustry, and attract private investments in the sector. 
 
The proposed AF project is aligned with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for DRC as it 
aims at contributing significantly to the Government➢❨ s efforts to alleviate extreme poverty and 
malnutrition (MDG1). It is also fully aligned with the fourth outcome of the CAS FY13-16, 



Page 4 of 13

addressing fragility through ➢❨ increased agriculture productivity and production and access to 
markets➢❨ . It is also consistent with major strategic initiatives for DRC, the Great Lakes region, 
and sub-Saharan Africa, including the second pillar (vulnerability and resilience) of the World 
Bank➢❨ s Africa Strategy and Africa Climate Business Plan. By supporting the development of 
agricultural value chains with strong economic potential, the proposed AF project is in line with 
the national strategy of DRC and the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program 
(CAADP). 
 
Several policy documents govern the agriculture sector, including the National Agriculture 
Investment Plan (NAIP), the Agricultural Code, a new proposal for Integrated Rural Development 
Centers, and the Agro-industrial Action Plan. In practice, ownership of these policies at the 
provincial level ➢❨  and even occasionally at the central level ➢❨  is low.  There is weak 
coordination and harmonization across the different policies and implementing agencies, and 
human, technical, and financial capacity to implement agricultural strategies is poor. 
 
DRC➢❨ s green revolution will require a technological leapfrog combined with progress on 
cross-cutting infrastructure, institutional and business climate issues in order to facilitate private 
investment and access to markets. From an operational perspective, DRC➢❨ s green revolution 
would pursue a two-track approach: (i) enabling traditional small-scale farmers to transition from 
subsistence farming to small holder commercial farming ; and (ii) promoting private investment 
in commercial agriculture using modern technologies geared toward mechanized farming and 
agro-processing for domestic and regional markets. 
 
DRC➢❨ s agro-industrial action plan (2015) proposes to privatize several government-owned 
farms, establish agro-industrial parks across all provinces, and has identified 60 abandoned   
farms for development. A focus on large commercial farms has the advantage of tackling many 
constraints simultaneously to promote faster growth in a challenging environment, albeit in a 
limited geographical area. Concentrating resources and political will in specific commercial zones 
can also serve to demonstrate the benefits of specific policy interventions, so that these could be 
scaled up.  Furthermore, incorporating smallholders into agro-industrial revitalization schemes 
will be critical for promoting peace, stability, and inclusive growth.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Original Project Development Objective(s) - Parent
The project development objective (PDO) is to increase agricultural productivity and improve 
marketing of crops, and animal products by smallholder farmers in targeted areas.

Proposed Project Development Objective(s) - Additional Financing
To increase agricultural productivity and improve marketing of crops and animal products crops 
and animal products in targeted areas.

Key Results 

D.  Project Description

The proposed Additional Financing will provide additional resources to reinforce the basic 
production capacity (staple crops and livestock) of smallholder farmers in three provinces to 



Page 5 of 13

ensure food and nutrition security, relaunch the perennial crops production and embark on 
commercial farming by selling surplus production on local markets. The AF will support the re-
emergence of a sustainable mixed farming system which is prevalent in the project areas. It will 
also revamp the extension and advisory services in the project areas giving a more prominent role 
to government institutions and involving the private sector. The AF will also assist the 
Government in setting up a sustainable feeder roads maintenance program and strengthening 
agriculture research and development. The AF will introduce information and communication 
technologies at different levels of the activities to enable mobile banking, remote sensing and 
other innovations to the beneficiaries. It will also expand a demand driven matching grant facility 
and combine it with free technical assistance so different actors can fully participate in the project 
activities. Finally the proposed AF also aims to promote climate adaptation (new technologies and 
management practices) and build community resilience (micro projects storage facilities, 
warehouses, processing centers, nurseries etc.). A partnership with the Central African Forest 
Initiative (CAFI) Fund is to be confirmed. The potential CAFI financing in the amount of US
$3.64 million as a grant would help enhance the environment benefits of the subprojects and 
increase the project efforts to reduce or mitigate deforestation and forest degradation.

Component Name
Component 1: Improving agricultural and animal production
Comments (optional)
Component 1 will consolidate and further develop the activities undertaken under the parent 
project which sought to increase the capacity of smallholder farmers in targeted areas to produce 
staple crops and small stock including chicken. The scope will be broadened to include the two 
additional territories and perennial crops like coffee and cocoa. The AF will support the private 
sector or small private enterprises interested in investing in commercial crops.  Cross-cutting 
issues such as nutrition, gender, climate smart agriculture, and employment will be fully 
embedded into the AF activities..

Component Name
Component 2: Improving marketing infrastructure
Comments (optional)
Component 2 aims to continue with the rehabilitation and maintenance of feeder roads and 
construction of key local markets and storage facilities across the three provinces with a focus on 
building capacity at local and provincial levels to ensure that all infrastructure investments are 
maintained and sustainable.

Component Name
Component 3: Capacity Building support to the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Rural 
Development, and project management
Comments (optional)
Component 3 will support the government efforts to: (i) re-engineer the national agriculture 
extension and advisory services so it is responsive and inclusive (non-governmental 
organizations, private sector and producer organizations as advisory service providers); (ii) 
strengthen the planning, coordination and monitoring and evaluation capacity at national and 
provincial levels (statistics and georeferenced data system); and (iii) strengthen the agricultural 
research and development for efficiency and effectiveness gains in their service delivery and 
conduct a skills needs assessment in the areas of agribusiness and agronomy; (iv) introduce

II. Implementation
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements
The same structure that governed the implementation of the parent project will remain, with a 
National Project Implementation Coordination Unit in Kinshasa and three Project Implementation 
units at provincial level, one per each newly created province. The delegated management contractor 
will be responsible for implementing the infrastructure component with an extension of UNOPS 
contract. For each province, a provincial coordination monitoring committee will be established to 
oversee the project's planning process and implementation.

III. Safeguard Policies that might apply

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental 
Assessment OP/BP 
4.01

Yes Project activities will generate impacts on environment, 
especially the ones relating to the rehabilitation and 
maintenance of feeder roads and construction of key local 
markets. In addition to this, the ongoing operation intends to 
fund sub-projects such as storage facilities, warehouses, 
processing centers, nurseries, etc. These activities will 
unquestionably induce adverse impacts on environmental 
components. However, adverse impacts are expected to be 
moderate, site specific and easily manageable. Besides, the 
exact locations of these investments are unknown to date. 
Consequently, an Environmental and social Assessment 
Framework (ESMF) which is the proper safeguard instrument 
in such a case has been prepared, reviewed, consulted upon 
and disclosed both in DRC on January 13, 2017 and at the 
Infoshop on January 17, 2017.

Natural Habitats OP/
BP 4.04

Yes This policy is triggered in the preventive way because of the 
potential of the project to cause loss or degradation of natural 
habitats, whether directly or indirectly. This policy is also 
triggered to draw attention when activities may be undertaken 



Page 7 of 13

near Natural habitats, with the possibility to impact them. The 
ESMF was prepared in line with the OP/BP4.01 includes a 
section handling this matter.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes The policy on Forests is triggered preventively as the project 
will be implemented in forested areas with the possibility of 
impact on the natural or plantation forests, and/or can bring 
some changes in management or protection of these forests. 
This is to avoid any significant conversion (loss) or 
degradation. This concern was taken in account in the ESMF.

Pest Management OP 
4.09

Yes Activities in the component 1 aims to improve agricultural and 
animal production where the main focus will be on improved 
access to fertilizers, pesticides, veterinary drugs and access to 
high quality and affordable agro-veterinary services. 
Consequently an Integrated Pest Management Plan (IPMP) 
about the safe use of agricultural pesticides and a promotion of 
the use of biological or environmental control methods was 
developed as a separate document. This safeguard tool has 
been reviewed, consulted upon and disclosed within DRC and 
at the Infoshop respectively on January 13 and January 17, 
2017.

Physical Cultural 
Resources OP/BP 
4.11

Yes In order to anticipate and to be sure that all the precautions 
have been taken to protect and safeguard physical cultural 
resources, a section addressing these concerns was included in 
the ESMF.  This is because activities related to the 
rehabilitation and the maintenance of feeder roads and other 
infrastructure works will induce excavations with potential 
discoveries of physical cultural resources.

Indigenous Peoples 
OP/BP 4.10

Yes As the project is focusing mainly on rural areas, and as there 
are Indigenous People in the project area, the Indigenous 
People Policy Framework (IPPF) of the parent project has been 
updated. Once the project site is clearly identified, the project 
will prepare an Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP).

Involuntary 
Resettlement OP/BP 
4.12

Yes This policy is triggered because of the potential restriction of 
access to assets or sources of livelihood as a result of the 
proposed project activities. Since the exact geographic 
coverage of proposed activities is still to be determined, the 
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) of the parent project 
has been updated by the Borrower for the project to clearly 
outline the basic principles and guidelines for mitigating any 
potential impact that may require compensation in the event of 
land acquisition and in some cases involuntary resettlement in 
the broad sense.

Safety of Dams OP/
BP 4.37

No The project will not finance dam works or activities associated 
to existing dams.

Projects on 
International 

Yes Projects on International Waterways OP/BP 7.50 is triggered 
because of planned irrigation activities. An exception to the 



Page 8 of 13

Waterways OP/BP 
7.50

Riparian Notification Requirement under OP 7.50 (Projects on 
International Waterways) was approved by the RVP on 
December 15, 2016. Due diligence was also completed under 
the parent project and an exception to the Riparian Notification 
Requirement was approved by the RVP on Oct 27, 2009..

Projects in Disputed 
Areas OP/BP 7.60

No The project will not be located in a Disputed Area.

IV. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify 

and describe any potential large scale,  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The Additional Financing will support activities related to the rehabilitation and the maintenance 
of feeder roads, the construction of key local markets, storage facilities, warehouses, processing 
centers, nurseries, etc. These civil works will unquestionably induce environmental and social 
adverse impacts in terms of trees cutting, dust, noise, waste management, and security and health 
issues both for populations and for employees. However, most of adverse impacts associated with 
these investments will likely be site-specific, so manageable at an acceptable level.  
In addition, those civil works will take place in forested areas. Potential adverse impacts could 
occur on forests and natural resources. The civil works could also induce impacts on Physical 
cultural resources.  
 
On social level, the rehabilitation/maintenance of feeder roads and the construction of local 
markets as well as warehouses may induce the displacement of populations. In addition, 
Indigenous people are present within areas where some civil works will be undertaken with the 
possibility to some adverse impacts on them.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities 
in the project area:
Anticipated negative environmental and social impacts of the project would result mainly from 
civil works associated with rural roads rehabilitation, but also from increase and intensified crop 
production. The consequence would be change in routine activities, use of fertilizers and 
pesticides, generation of solid and liquid waste, acquisition/taking of private land. In addition, the 
potential use of quarry materials for consolidation of rural roads could also be sources of negative 
impacts on both the natural and physical environment, which will require restoration actions after 
use.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts.
Not relevant.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The project remains EA category B and triggers eight safeguards policies which are OP/BP 4.01; 
OP/BP 4.04, OP/BP4.36; OP4.09; OP/BP4.11, OP/BP7.50; OP/BP4.10 and OP/PB 4.12.   
 
Considering that the exact geographic locations of project specific interventions are not yet 
determined with certainty, the Borrower updated four environmental and social safeguards 
instruments, namely an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF), a 



Page 9 of 13

Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), the Indigenous People Policy Framework (IPPF) and a 
Pest Management Plan (PMP) in compliance with the core requirements of the triggered 
safeguards policies : OP/BP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), OP 4.09 (Pest Management), OP/
BP.4.10 (Indigenous People) and OP/BP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement).  The ESMF has also 
made provision to address basic requirements from both OP/BP 4.36 (forestry) and OP/BP 4.04 
(Natural Habitats). Both the ESMF and the PMP were reviewed and cleared by the Bank and the 
Government and disclosed both in-country on January 13, 2017 and at the InfoShop on January 
17, 2017. The RPF and the IPPF was were also reviewed and cleared by the Bank, and disclosed 
both in-country on  January 13, 2017 and at the InfoShop on  January 17, 2017. 
 
During the parent project implementation, screening of sub-projects has taken place to ensure 
proper identification and mitigation of any adverse impacts. Consequently, many ESIA, RAP and 
IPPs have been prepared, disclosed and implemented as guidance/guidelines prior to activities 
implementation. As the parent project, the ongoing AF will follow the same process regarding the 
safeguard aspects.  
 
There is a recently recruited safeguards specialist in the PIU, who is familiar with project activities 
in the parent project, he has also been implicated in the preparation stage. For Component 2, the 
Contractor (UNOPS) has equally recruited a safeguards specialist, as well as the Netherlands 
Development Organization (Stichting Nederlandse Vrijwilligers/SNV) that implemented the IPP 
of the parent project, also has a safeguards specialist in the team. To supervise the implementation 
of social measures, it is recommended that the project recruit a social expert. 
All the environmental and social safeguard specialists involved in the team will ensure that all the 
sub-projects to be financed under the AF are in full compliance with Bank safeguards policies and 
in line with the national regulatory framework. Furthermore, the National Agency in charge of 
environmental impact assessment and safeguards monitoring (Agence Congolaise de 
l➢❨ Environnementale-ACE) is also involved in the environmental and social aspects monitoring.  
 
Lastly, the safeguards specialists at the World Bank, part of the project team, will ensure that all 
the project staff are trained on safeguards on the one hand and will be part on supervision missions 
on the other hand with the aim to make sure safeguards aspects are properly handled.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders are the beneficiary communities, Ministries in charge of Agriculture, 
fisheries and livestock, rural development, transport, Environment and sustainable development 
(and their relevant agencies/departments), municipalities, NGOs and other relevant institutions. 
 
One of the key principles of this project from the outset was to foster participation of all relevant 
stakeholders. This approach will be sustained throughout project implementation. The 
environmental and social assessment studies, namely the ESMF, IPMP. IPPF and RPF, were also 
carried out according to the same principle, using broad-based public consultation approach, 
involving the above stakeholder groups. The objective was to raise awareness of project activities 
and impacts and foster ownership on their part. All the relevant bodies have been adequately 
informed of the Project. Concerns of the communities and some details of consultations have been 
taken into account in the body of the different reports and other results provided as Annexes. The 
key concerns raised during the consultation process included: (i) permanent information and 
sensitization of the population, (ii) compensation process for those impacted by the project, (iii) 
participation of local population as employee on works they qualify for, (iv) the involvement of 



Page 10 of 13

NGOs and state technical services during the execution of works. All these concerns have been 
addressed in the alternatives proposed through the developed safeguards instruments.

B. Introduction and Context 

 
Country Context 

Benin is a coastal State in West Africa located in the tropical zone with a total surface area of 114,763 km². It is bordered 

by Togo (West), Nigeria (East), Burkina Faso and Niger (North), and the Atlantic Ocean (South).  In a politically stable 

and democratic regime for nearly 30 years, the Government of Benin (GoB) maintains a decentralized territorial 

administration comprising 77 municipalities (elected) in 12 departments. The population was estimated at 11.2 million in 

2017, of which 51 percent are women, 52 percent are 18 or younger, and 55 percent live in rural areas (national census, 

RGPH4). If the current growth rate of 3.2 percent per year is maintained, the population could reach 17.6 million by 2030. 

With a per capita income of just US$820 in 2016, Benin is among the poorest countries in the World.  The share of the 

population living below the national poverty rate was estimated at 40% in 2015, of which 63.5% earn less than a dollar/day 

(EMICov 2015).  Poverty rate is higher in rural areas (42%) than in urban areas (32%).  In 2014, youth (15-29 years old) 

unemployment rate was at 14.3% and the percentage of youth in the informal sector was 89.6% (ETVA 2014).  The 

country ranks 163 out of 189 on the UNDP Human Development Index (HDI) 2017. 

In addition to transit trade with neighboring countries, especially Nigeria, Benin’s economy relies heavily on agriculture 

(cotton, in particular). The agriculture sector is the second largest contributor to GDP (25 percent) and employs around 

70 percent of the labor force (15-64 years old)1. Benin's agriculture—primarily extensive, slash-and-burn—is one of the 

major drivers of deforestation and forest degradation.  

 
 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 

The Benin's forest areas are divided into two categories: 

                                                           
1 The informal economy represents 65 percent of GDP, engaging 90 percent of the labor force and more than 95 percent of the female labor 
force. Services and agriculture, accounting for approximately 50 and 25 percent respectively of total value added, are both dominated by the 

informal sector. The large share of services reflects Benin’s role as a transit and trade hub for landlocked countries in the north, primarily Niger 

and Burkina Faso, but also the large amount of informal re-export trade and commerce with Nigeria, which amounts to some 20 percent of GDP 

and 25 percent of government revenue. (Source: Benin CPF 2018)

a) the Classified Estate Domain (CED), a national heritage belonging to the Central State, is managed 
by the Directorate General of Water, Forests and Hunting (DGEFC: Direction Générale des Eaux 

et Forêts et Chasse), the National Office for Wood (ONAB: Office National du Bois), and the 

National Center for the Management of Wildlife (CENAGREF), all three entities being under the 

authority of the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (MCVDD: Ministère du 

Cadre de Vie et du Développement Durable). The CED includes: (i) 46 Gazetted Forests (GFs), of 

which 39 (as well as seven Reforestation Perimeters) are managed by the DGEFC and seven 

managed by ONAB mainly for timber production for export; and (ii) two National Parks (Pendjari 

and W) with three hunting zones managed by the CENAGREF. 

b) the Protected Estate Domain (PED), which comprises the rest of the forest areas in the Rural 
Domain. The PED forests, authorized for multiple usages, including agriculture, are under the 

territorial jurisdiction of the municipalities and managed by the mayors under the supervision of the 

DGEFC. 

 

The forest policy (law 93-009 of July 1993) that governs the forest regime in the Republic of Benin was 

revised in 2012.  It is currently being updated with funding from the European Union to incorporate new 

guidelines for sustainable forests management and is expected to be submitted to Parliament approval by 

mid-2019. A number of policy and strategy documents have also been produced to improve the 

management of forest and natural resources, including the: (i) National Program for Sustainable 

Management of Natural Resources (2008); (ii) National Strategy for Rural Wood Markets (2008); (iii) 

National Strategy and Action Plan on Biodiversity 2011-2020 (2011) and (iv) National Strategy for Climate 

Change mitigation and adaption (2018). In addition, Benin has also ratified several international 

conventions relating to the management and conservation of forest resources. 

Despite this institutional context for management of the sector, the decrease of Beninese forest cover, 

particularly over the decade from 2007-2016, is concerning:  Benin’s national forest cover, estimated at 

8.12 million hectares in 2007 (70.4% of the national territory), fell to 7.9 million hectares in 2016 (68.5% 

of the territory), a loss of over 215,000 ha. If the current deforestation rate is maintained, the per capita 

forest area, which more than halved from 1.63 ha in 1980 to 0.87 ha in 1995, will fall even further, to 0.29 

ha by 2025 (MEHU/DGFRN 2012).  

The root cause of deforestation and forest degradation in Benin is the weak capacity of the Forest 

Administration to ensure management operations in Gazetted Forests. The Administration has personnel in 

the field who, although technically competent, lack adequate operational means to monitor the GFs. This 

presence in the field is limited by serious shortcomings in physical assets, most glaringly in forest rangers 

living quarters, which are in poor condition (lacking in access to water, electricity, means of 

communication). With surveillance being carried out sporadically and in half-measure, Gazetted Forests 

have become the theater of: (i) expansion of clandestine farms, which rely on extensive slash-and-burn 

agriculture; (ii) transhumance or the settling of herds in GFs; (iii) unregulated removals of fuelwood; and 

(iv) establishment of human settlements in GFs. 

The indirect causes of deforestation include increasing demographic pressure and climate change, the latter 

of which is slowing down the forest cover regeneration process and reducing biomass in the GFs through 

faster drying up and silting of streams, more frequent flooding, and increased soil erosion.

To improve the integrated management of targeted gazette forests, to increase access of the main consumption cities 
to fuelwood produced sustainably, and to strengthen selected NTFP value chains for forest-dependent communities. 
 

Key Results 

PDO Level Indicators 
(i) Forest areas under sustainable management (ha); 
(ii) Sequestration of CO2 in target areas (in metric tons/CO2 eq.);  
(iii) Wood energy plantations established for supply to the three major consumption hubs (ha); 
(iv) Communities adjacent to targeted GFs with increased access to income sources through NTFP 

value chains (number). 

(v) Direct beneficiaries (of which women); 
(vi) Satisfaction of beneficiaries (level of engagement, by gender and age per target area). 

 
 
D. Project Description  

The project will consist of four components: 
1) Support to Forests Governance; 
2) Integretaed Management of Gazetted Forests; 
3) Development of Selected Non-Timber Forests Products Value Chains; 
4) Project Management. 
 
E. Implementation 

 
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 

An Integrated Projects Management Unit (IPMU) will be responsible for the implementation of all WB-

financed environment, forestry and NRM projects, under the responsibility of the Ministry of Environment, 

and Sustainable Development, including West Africa Coast Areas (WACA), the GFM project and the 

upcoming Green Climate Fund (GCF) project.   

The current WACA PIU will be upgraded to an IPMU.  It will be composed of the following shared units 

by all projects under its responsibility: (i) Financial Management, (ii) Procurement, (iii) Safeguards, (iv) 

Monitoring & Evaluation, (v) Communication and (vi) administrative support, as well as a shared Steering 

Committee.  The shared Steering Committed will be in place before project effectiveness. These units will 

be strengthened as needed with fiduciary, safeguards, M&E and Communication staff to support the GFM 

project implementation.   

Each project under the IPMU will have a dedicated project coordinator and a Technical Assistant depending 

on the project workload. For the GFMP, the dedicated coordinator will be supported by an international 

top-notch forestry specialist. Both will be recruited competitively before project effectiveness.  

The Director General of DGEFC in his role as National Coordinator of the Government Forestry Program, 

will be the Director of the GFMP to mainly ensure synergies with that Program. The decentralized 

Technical Forests Management Units (CTAF) in the field will ensure technical execution of project 

activities.  The CTAF will report to the GFM project coordinator, who will in turn report to the General 

Director of DGEFC.  The headcount of CTAF employees has been increased by the Government to include 

personnel fully dedicated to project implementation, especially for timely implementation of production 

forests activities.

SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The project will finance works for the physical 
demarcation of conservation areas, the restoration 
of selected urban GFs in major cities as urban parks. 
The operation under preparation will also support 
the development of timber production, fuelwood 
production as well as the Income Generating 
Activities(IGA)such as animal husbandry, vegetable 
gardening and Non Timber Forest Products(NTFP) as 
well. Such activities are most of the time, associated 
with potential adverse impacts on environment even 
though these impacts are considered as being 
moderate. However, the locations of specific 
investments will not be known with certainty prior 
to board approval. Consequently, an Environmental 
and Social Management Framework (ESMF) was 
developed ,reviewed, consulted upon and disclosed 
both in Benin and on the Bank’s website on March 
12, 2019. 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No This policy is not triggered under this project. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

Activities related to the physical demarcation of 
conservation areas, the restoration of selected 
urban GFs in major cities as urban parks, the 
development of timber production, fuelwood 
production as well as the Income Generating 
Activities could impact negatively Natural Habitats if

not well managed. The ESMF developed in line with 
OP4.01, includes a chapter related to Natural 
habitats  proper management during physical works. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

Some activities such as the agro-forestry, the 
physical demarcation of conservation areas, could 
also impact forests. In addition, the objective of the 
Government objective to increase the volume of 
timber produced annually from the current 65,000 
to 250 000 m3 through large-scale plantations in 
selected GFs (Alibori Supérieur, Ouémé Superieur, 
Dogo and Lama) in order to increase the sector 
contribution to the economy could lead to some 
forests overexploitation. A specific section focused 
on forest resources protection was developed and 
included in the ESMF. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The project will support adoption of agricultural 
intensification and agroforestry methods through a 
stocktaking of existing successful national and 
regionally employed agroforestry methods and 
agricultural intensification techniques in order to 
recommend those practices most suitable to the 
project target zones. For that reason the O4.09 is 
triggered. Consequently, a Pest Management 
Plan(PMP) was developed and included in the ESMF 
to guide any potential use of chemical products as 
part of the project. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

The project intends to support the physical 
demarcation of conservation areas as well as IGA 
such  vegetable gardening. Such activities could 
induce excavations with potential cultural properties 
discoveries. In order to anticipate and to be sure 
that all the precautions were taken to protect and 
safeguard physical cultural resources, the ESMF 
includes a section on how to handle in a proper way 
chance finds of cultural assets within the project 
area. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
There are no Indigenous People as per the definition 
of the policy in the project areas. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

No involuntary resettlement is anticipated. 
However, the demarcation of conservation areas 
could lead to the limitation of access of resources. 
To anticipate any issue related to these aspects,  the 
project has prepared a Process Framework. Once 
prepared, that document was reviewed, consulted

upon and disclosed in Benin and on the Bank's 
website on March 13, 2019. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No The project will not finance dams nor rely on dams. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
The project is not expected to affect international 
waterways. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No The project will not be located in a Disputed Area. 

 
 

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
Overall, the Benin-gazetted forests management project aims at safeguarding gazetted Forests as well as restoring 
degraded areas. Based on that, it will induce essentially positive impacts. However, some activities such as the physical 
demarcation of conservation areas, the restoration of selected urban GFs in major cities as urban parks, the 
development of timber production, the fuelwood production as well as the Income Generating Activities(IGA)such as 
animal husbandry, vegetable gardening and Non Timber Forest Products(NTFP) might produce potential adverse 
impacts. However,such adverse impacts are expected to be moderate, site specific and manageable at an acceptable 
level. That is why the project is rated as a category B. 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
The Benin-gazetted forests management project aims to protect the forests by limiting significantly their degradation. 
This measure could involve  a reduction of the agricultural productions' yield by stopping the itinerant agriculture. The 
impossibility to expand henceforth farming areas in conjunction with demographic explosion could exacerbate land 
disputes.  
However, the project will support adoption of agricultural intensification and agroforestry methods through a 
stocktaking of existing successful national and regionally employed agroforestry methods and agricultural 
intensification techniques in order to recommend those practices most suitable to the project target zones.  
 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
N/A 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
As the exact geographic locations of project specific interventions are not yet determined with certainty, the Borrower 
has developed two environmental and social safeguards instruments, namely an Environmental and Social 
Management Framework (ESMF) including a Pest Management Plan,  in compliance with the triggering of  OP/BP 4.01 
(Environmental Assessment) and OP 4.09 (Pest Management)  and a Process Framework(PF) as per OP/BP 4.12 
(Involuntary Resettlement) triggering. 
Further to that, the ESMF includes two chapters focusing on Natural Habitats and Forests safeguarding. Both chapters 
make the project fully in compliance with the OP4.04 and OP4.36. Additionally, a section related to a procedure of 



 

The World Bank  
Benin: Gazetted Forests Management Project (P167678) 

 

 

  
Feb 28, 2019 Page 9 of 13  

 

“chance find” was also included in the ESMF in line with the triggering of the OP4.11. 
The ESMF lays out procedures for screening and mitigating impacts from construction and operation of the irrigation 
schemes, and includes the following: (a) checklists of potential environmental and social impacts and their sources; (b) 
procedures for participatory screening of proposed sites and activities and the environmental and social 
considerations; (c) procedures for assessing potential environmental and social impacts of the planned project 
activities; (d) institutional arrangements for mitigating, preventing, and managing the identified impacts; (e) typical 
environmental management planning process for addressing negative externalities in the course of project 
implementation; (f) a system for monitoring the implementation of mitigation measures; and (g) recommended 
capacity building measures for environmental planning and monitoring of project activities.  
 
The Pest management’s section deals with safeguard measures to be taken in the case of the use of pesticide to fight 
against agriculture predators. However, organic fertilizers and biological technics are supplies recommended to be use 
first. Moreover, that section sets up guidance and guidelines with the aim of protecting population health and 
environment integrity in promoting best practices. 
 
Specific ESIAs will be prepared for relevant activities before project implementation along with Environmental and 
Social Management Plans (ESMPs). The ESIAs will provide mitigation measures for all the potential impacts as a result 
of the triggering of the above-mentioned safeguard policies. 
The Process Framework will guide new modalities of gazetted forest as well as restored areas access and use of their 
resources. 
Responsibility and oversight of the Project’s overall compliance with national legislation and Bank safeguard policies 
will rest with the environmental and social specialists in the PIU, as the main persons in charge of project 
implementation and monitoring of safeguard aspects. They will be working in close collaboration with the national 
entity responsible for ensuring the compliance of the project’s activities with the national legislation namely 
ABE(Beninese Environment Agency). That government’s body will conduct periodic monitoring of project’s compliance 
with proposed mitigation. It also receive guidance and technical support from bank’s environmental and social 
safeguard specialist during implementation support missions or through sessions of training. 
 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The populations who will be impacted by the project activities are mainly the rural communities. They are the forest 
owners, the farmers, the hunters, the coalmen and forest loggers. During the  project preparation, these various socio-
professional layers have been consulted. In addition, these consultations have concerned the Civil Society 
Organizations (CSO) such as  the NGOs opening in the environmental management and the natural resources fields , 
producers organizations, associations, private operators, deputies, etc. These meetings are held in the form of 
workshops, of meetings, meetings of work.  
After the preparation of safeguard instruments, a validation workshop with the participation of the ABE  and all the 
above-mentioned stakeholders was held on February,2019. At this occasion, comments and suggestions from 
participants were taken in both documents.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 

Niger is one of the world’s poorest and least developed countries in the world, with a per capita income of 
US$390 in 2015 and almost half of Nigeriens living beneath the poverty line (45.7 percent in 2014). In 2015, 
Niger ranked last of 188 countries on the United Nations Human Development Index. The Nigerien economy is 
highly dependent on its agricultural sector and a few commodities (uranium, oil and gold), making it vulnerable 
to climate and price shocks. With a variable and changing climate, the country suffers from recurrent drought 
and food crises. Niger has one of the fastest population growth rates in the world (4 percent in 2015) and the 
youngest population in the world, with a dependency ratio of 113 in 2015. Niger has significant institutional 
deficits, ranking 99 of 168 countries in the 2015 Corruption Perceptions Index. 

 

Niger meets the very definition of a country at risk of fragility, conflict of violence. The country—which held 
presidential and general elections in March 2016—has managed to remain stable in a difficult regional 
environment. Some of the factors that account for this achievement include: (i) a relatively strong social 
cohesion and (ii) a political settlement in which the elites manage to solve their disputes in a regulated manner. 
However, several factors contribute to the country’s fragility. These include demographic trends combined 
with notable climate change–related events and the deterioration of natural resources in the most populated 
areas; the contestation of the political elite and state institutions; external stresses; and a lack of economic 
opportunities. Because several risk factors — such as climate-related events or the tightening of the elite 
coalition — could trigger instability and violence, Niger remains a country at risk. 

 

Niger is hosting over 280,000 people displaced by conflict: approximately 158,000 refugees, 109,000 Internally 
Displaced People (IDPs) and 16,000 Nigerien nationals who returned from Nigeria as a consequence of the 
conflict. This displacement has been caused by two regional conflicts: the crisis in Mali (accounting for 22 
percent of the total displaced) and the Boko Haram regional crisis (78 percent).

Since 2011, there has been an increasing number of attacks on Niger’s territory. The country, which held 
presidential and general elections in March 2016, has managed to remain an “island of stability”, but the 
relatively strong social cohesion is fragile. Niger is part of internationally-supported military efforts against 
Boko Haram (through the Joint Multi National Force) and in Mali, but increased military spending is putting a 
severe strain on public finances. The Risk and Resilience Assessment (RRA) highlights the security and economic 
impacts of regional conflicts and forced displacement on Niger, including the crises in Libya, Mali and Nigeria 
and notes that the expansion of Boko Haram into Niger has had an adverse impact on economic activities in 
the Diffa region and also raises concerns about the weakness of the Nigerien Army (e.g. following the attack in 
Bosso, Niger had to call on Chad for military assistance). The RRA argues that each military defeat raises the 
risk of a military coup in Niger. 

 

Overall, the situation remains in flux. Despite a recent slowdown, further flows of population may be caused 
by Boko Haram until the region is fully stabilized. The authorities are eager to demonstrate the normalization 
of the situation both in the Diffa region and along the Mali-Niger border, but insecurity remains very high. On 
the one hand, there may be pressures to eventually encourage the return of forcibly displaced people in the 
Diffa area, on the other hand there seems to be a degree of acceptance that the situation along the Mali-Niger 
border may last.  

Across all forced displacement situations, the conditions for women and girls are very specific. Gender-based 
violence and survival sex are relatively prevalent. Early marriages are often the norm, including within host 
communities and economic opportunities and access to education are very limited for women and girls. Unless 
the gender dimension of the situation is effectively dealt with, progress is likely to remain elusive. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 

Niger has adopted a relatively progressive approach to managing refugee situations. This is also reflected in 
the solidarity demonstrated by host communities in particular in the Diffa Region. The overall legal and 
protection environment in Niger is conducive to an effective socio-economic response to the forced 
displacement crisis. Niger is a party to applicable international conventions on refugees, IDPs, and stateless 
persons, and it has domesticated some of these instruments. In particular, refugees are to be treated equally 
under the law with respect to key socio-economic rights: property ownership, security, access to the courts, 
access to basic services, and freedom of expression and movement. Efforts are underway to strengthen the 
legal framework applicable to IDPs in light of the situation in the Diffa Region. 

 

Niger is party to the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (1951 Convention), 
1967 United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees (1967 Protocol) and 1969 Organization of 
African Unity Convention Governing Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa (OAU Convention), without 
any reservations. Niger has also domesticated these instruments: the government has affirmed both in national 
legislation and at representations to the CERD that refugees are to be treated equally under the law with 
respect to all rights: property ownership, security, access to the courts, access to basic services, and freedom 
of expression and movement (CERD 2013). Article 10 of the 1997 law ensures the equal treatment of refugees 
in the protection of property; freedom of movement; and access to health, education, and housing. Elsewhere,

the Labor Code prohibits discrimination on the basis of nationality in hiring, and Décret n° 87-
076/PCMS/MI/MAE/C of June 18, 1987, permits foreigners to be contracted for employment provided that the 
contract is approved by the Ministry of Labor. 

 

Niger is also party to the African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced 
Persons in Africa (Kampala Convention), but has yet to domesticate it. Preliminary discussions are underway 
for the domestication of the convention and authorities have indicated willingness to improve the legal 
framework on IDPs, especially in light of the situation in the Diffa Region. Finally, Niger is signatory of both 
1954 Convention on the Status of Stateless Persons (Convention on Statelessness) and 1961 Convention on the 
Reduction of Statelessness. Efforts to align domestic legislation with the provisions of both conventions are 
underway, with an ongoing review of the domestic legislation on nationality and civil status registration. 

 

Malian refugees are recognized on a prima facie basis and enjoy a favorable protection environment with 
the right to settle where they wish and to access basic social services and the formal and informal job market. 
A tripartite agreement between UNHCR and the Governments of Niger and Mali, signed in 2014 provides a 
legal framework for voluntary returns in respect of the related international standards. The parties consider 
that the conditions in parts of northern Mali are not yet conducive to returns in safety and dignity. As a result, 
voluntary repatriation is currently not promoted. Persons that wish nevertheless to return to Mali are 
counseled on the prevailing situation and sign a Voluntary Repatriation Form. They receive one-time cash 
assistance to pay for their transport (UNHCR 2016). Out-of-camp policy applied in Malian refugee-hosted areas 
with success, leading to the creation of so-called Zones d’Accueil des Réfugiés. Several institutions work closely 
with UNHCR to process status determinations for refugees, including the Comité National d’Eligibilité (CNE), 
the Comité d’Appel, the secretariat within the Direction Générale de l'État Civil et des Réfugiés, and the Comité 
de Recours Gracieux (CRG).  Regional administrations such as those in Diffa are also key partners to the national 
government and international NGOs.  The Direction Générale de l'État Civil et des Réfugiés is in charge of 
ensuring administrative protection to refugees and asylum seekers. 

 
Relationship to CPF 

 

The CPF recognizes the need to mitigating the three negative consequences of forced displacement in Niger: 
(1) the effect on the economy of increased insecurity and the subsequent outlays on security and humanitarian 
assistance; (2) increased food insecurity (exacerbating the effects of drought, environmental degradation, high 
grain prices and poor food access); and (3) increased poverty due to the loss of productive assets (land, 
agricultural tools and inputs, seeds, animals, etc) caused by forced displacement. Specifically, within the 
objective 5 of the CPF namely “Improved Social Protection System and Ability to Manage Forced Displacement” 
the CPF includes two expected outcomes to which this operation directly contributes: 5.3 Refugees who benefit 
from a vulnerability-based assistance system and 5.4. Refugees who benefit from country systems in the health 
sector The CPF also tracks the “percentage of refugees who benefit from a vulnerability-based assistance 
system” in its Result Matrix.  

 

The successful support to displaced and host population would require synergies among the proposed project 
together with (i) the Disaster Risk Management and Urban Development project, (ii) the Safety Net Project, (iii)

window. The list reflects the entirety of needs under the government’s strategy in the targeted regions. The evaluation 
period (between September 2017 - March 2018) will allow for further assessments and an extensive consultative process 
to identify those activities within this framework that will be directly financed through this project. The overall 
comprehensive list of activities will be developed into a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework to enable

the government in leading and coordinating the overall program, inclusive of all different partner activities, in the targeted 
regions. The identification of the specific type of activities in the targeted regions will be based on a rapid Markets and 
Needs Assessment. 

 

Components 

Activities identified under the government strategy are grouped below into three main project components along the 
three resilience levels targeted for improvement: 1) community, 2) individual, and 3) local authorities.  

 

COMPONENT 1 - Community level resilience: Access to basic social services and local capacity building 

This component will aim to build resilience on the community level through investment in community infrastructure and 
services; capacity building to government authorities; and social cohesion measures.  Investments will be identified in 
consultation with communities by updating and/or preparing the Local Development Plans. Communes/communities will 
be responsible for the identification and preparation of the subproject proposals as well as the supervision of their 
implementation and operation and maintenance. Final subprojects selection and contracting will be done by the 
respective line agencies in accordance to the national planning process. 

 

This component will focus on two main types of activities: 

A. Investment in community infrastructure and services: 
1. Municipal services: Reconstructing and repairing small water supply facilities, latrines and other sanitation 

infrastructure, as well as solid waste management infrastructure and service delivery. 
2. Education: Reconstructing and repairing damaged school infrastructure such as classrooms, offices, fences, 

playground, latrines, labs, and other associated service delivery interventions. 
3. Health: Reconstructing or rehabilitating health center buildings, and other associated service delivery 

interventions in respect of staff, furniture and supplies. 
4. Economic infrastructure: Constructing or rehabilitating of rural markets, community storage facilities, rural 

roads, small bridges, culverts, and small irrigation schemes.   
5. Natural Resources: Restoring and protecting natural resources and supporting environmental management 

measures to decrease environmental impacts of protracted refugee presence. 

 

B. Community Resilience and Social Cohesion Measures: 
1. Community associations: Setting up and strengthening community associations that bring together local 

authorities (government, traditional and religious) and representatives of all different segments of the 
population in order to build and reinforce social cohesion.  

2. Small social cohesion grants: Supporting initiatives that address key drivers of the conflict and needs 
emerging in the post-conflict period such as out-of-school children and youth literacy, sports for peace 
activities, community radio programing, cultural activities that promote common identities, sexual and 
gender based violence prevention campaigns and de-stigmatization campaigns. 

3. Community-based psychosocial support: Providing targeted support to communities to address potential 
mental health risks resulting from the forced displacement experience.   

 

COMPONENT 2 - Individual level resilience: Strengthening economic opportunities and professional training 

This component will focus on two main types of activities: 

A. Transitional Support towards Stabilization and Self-Reliance by (a) increasing and improving the access to basic 
necessity kits; (b) restoring immediate access to productive assets by providing agricultural inputs and livestock 
for farming families and trading commodities for non-farmers; and (c) setting-up Cash for Work programs to

Niger Forcibly Displaced Support Project (P164563) 

 
 

  
Jul 18, 2017 Page 8 of 12  

     

support community assets recovery and reconstruction. The cash-for-work component activities will be closely 
linked to the priority infrastructure investments in component 1. 

B. Support to Business Development and Individual Skill Building: provision of professional education, on-the-job 
training,  “portable skills” and support of small business development opportunities for youth/women. provide a 
package of interventions that combines short-term trainings (including basic financial literacy) and accompanying 
mentoring/technical assistance, access to small matching grant, and citizen engagement mechanisms. The focus 
of skills trainings might differ between locations based on an assessment of the market and needs in the region.  

 

COMPONENT 3 - Capacity building of local authorities 

This component will focus on two main types of activities: 

A. Local planning and decentralized service delivery: Providing capacity building interventions for communes and 
local implementing institutions to ensure adequate capacities in the areas of community‐driven planning process, 
local development management, service delivery capacities enhancement, mainstreaming of project 
interventions with the government’s development planning and budgeting process, as well as coordination of all 
development stakeholders on the local level and community level. 

B. Preparedness of Government institutions to manage displacements:  Strengthening government actors to be 
more prepared for potential future displacements by supporting their administrative management capacity (i.e. 
supporting and coordinating biometric registration of population) as well as humanitarian management capacity 
(i.e. contingency planning for displacements). 

 

COMPONENT 4 - Contingency Emergency Response Component 

This contingent emergency response component is included under the project in accordance with OP/BP 10.00, 
paragraphs 12 and 13, for situations of urgent need of assistance. This will allow for rapid reallocation of project funds in 
the event natural or manmade crisis in the future, during the implementation of the project. This component will have 
no funding allocation initially, but will be used to draw resources from the unallocated expenditure category and/or allow 
the government to request the WB to reallocate financing from other project components to cover emergency response 
and recovery costs, if approved by the WB. 

 

COMPONENT 5 - Project Management 

This sub-component will cover: (a) strengthening the capacity of the Project Steering Committee for overall Project 
coordination; and (b) strengthening the capacity of the Project Implementation Unit for project management, 
coordination, monitoring and evaluation, including: (i) fiduciary (i.e. financial and procurement management); (ii) 
environmental and social assessments; (iii) preparation of project reports; and (iv) monitoring and evaluation. 

 
 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The specific sites for infrastructure investments and their scope will be determined during project preparation based on 

the government’s detailed assessments of priority needs within the target regions in consultation with local population 
and authorities and detailed technical studies to be undertaken. The general areas include sites hosting refugees in Diffa 
region and along the Malian border in Tillaberi, Tahoua and Agadez regions.

B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
 
The Government of Niger has previously successfully implemented Bank-financed projects for which Environmental and 

Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs), Environmental and Social Management Frameworks (ESMF), Resettlement Policy 
Frameworks (RPFs), Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) and Pest Management Plans (PMPs) were approved by the Bank.  
The Bureau des Evaluations Environnementales et des Études d’Impacts (BEEEI), the National Environmental Agency 

(NEA), and its decentralized structures, have the capacity to assure the external monitoring of the implementation of the 
of the ESMF, RPF and PMP under the project, including ensuring and validating that the provisions of the ESMF and RPF, 
leading to further sub-projects environmental and social assessments, are followed (i.e., sub-projects categorization, 
review, clearance and monitoring of the sub-project-specific EIAs/EMPs and RAPs), on behalf of the Government.  
Overall project environmental and social safeguards compliance, with national laws and regulations and applicable World 

Bank operational policies and procedures, will be devolved to BEEEI.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The project will rehabilitate and upgrade 
infrastructures in several locations. As the sites and 
works are not yet finalized, an Environmental and 
Social Management Framework (ESMF) will be 
prepared, consulted upon, and disclosed both in-
country and at the World Bank Website before 
appraisal. The ESMF will formulate standard methods 
and procedures, along with clear institutional 
arrangements for screening, review, approval, 
implementation and monitoring of sub-project-specific 
safeguards instruments (Environmental and Social 
Management Plans ESMPs, Environmental and Social 
Impact Assessments ESIAs) as necessary. These 
instruments will also be consulted upon and disclosed 
in-country and at World Bank Website. A Social 
Assessment will be conducted in parallel to 
complement the safeguards documents. 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No  

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No 

Due to the location of interventions in areas were 
infrastructure and/or productive activities were 
already in place, no negative impacts to critical or 
sensitive natural habitats are expected. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 
No interventions are financed in forest areas, nor do 
they involve forests.

Jul 18, 2017 Page 10 of 12  

     

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

Although procurement of pesticides is not envisaged 
under the project, it is expected that intensification of 
agricultural production and productivity will likely lead 
to an increased use of pesticides. 
The Government will update its existing Pest 
Management Plan and submit it to the Bank for 
clearance and then disclosure in-country and at World 
Bank website, prior to appraisal. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

The Physical Cultural Resources Policy (OP 4.11) is 
triggered because Niger is viewed as a rich cultural 
heritage area. Though it is unknown at this time which 
sites may contain such resources, due to the lack of 
specifics on the locations, size, scale of planned 
investments under the project. Chance Find 
Procedures will be applied as indicated in the ESMF. 
The ESMF will address potential impacts and includes 
suggested mitigation measures. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No There are no Indigenous Peoples in the project area. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

OP 4.12 is triggered due to the potential impacts 
related to civil works, which may lead to minor land 
acquisition, loss of assets and/or access to resources. 
A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) will be 
prepared, consulted upon, approved and disclosed in-
country and at the World Bank website prior to 
appraisal. The RPF will formulate standard methods 
and procedures, along with clear institutional 
arrangements for screening, review, approval, 
implementation and monitoring of sub-project-specific 
safeguards instruments such as Resettlements Action 
Plans (RAPs) if necesary. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 

The project will not finance the building of dams and is 
not supporting dam infrastructure. Subject to 
technical studies the project may finance local flood 
prevention structures that may temporarily retain 
excess water during peak volume events, but which do 
not pose dam safety issues. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 

OP 7.50 is not triggered as there are no infrastructure 
investments likely to affect water flow of Niger or 
Komadougou international waterways under the 
project. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
OP 7.60 is not triggered as there are no known 
disputes over project areas.

I. Project Context 

 Country Context 

 

More than twenty years after the end of apartheid, unemployment, poverty and inequality remain 

important development challenges in South Africa, despite substantial progress in overcoming the 

legacy of the past. While total employment increased from 9 million in 1996 to 16 million in 2015, the 

unemployment rate has stayed stubbornly high in the range of 20-26 percent. In 2015 approximately 5.4 

million South Africans were unemployed, of which about 40 percent were new entrants.  A 30 percent 

increase in per capita GDP since the late 1990s and a sharp expansion of the social grant coverage 

enabled a significant decline in the poverty rate—from 43.5 percent of the population living below 

ZAR219 (inflation-adjusted) a month in 2000 to 36.7 percent (or 18.3 million people) living below R501 

in 2015. Nevertheless, pockets of poverty remain deeply entrenched, mostly among the historically 

disadvantaged population. With a relatively stagnant income Gini coefficient of around 0.69 in 2011 

(versus 0.72 in 2006) and expenditure Gini of 0.634 in 2015 (versus 0.67 in 2006), South Africa has one 

of the highest inequality rates in the world. Land distribution, in particular, is one of the most unequal in 

the world. Threatening progress in poverty alleviation is the impact of the drought on agriculture and the 

widening gap between those with and without jobs. 

Recent developments in economic activity are not indicative of major improvements in growth or 

employment. South Africa’s annual GDP is estimated to have increased by 1.3 percent in 2015,

compared to 1.5 percent in 2014 and 2.2 percent in 2013, a result of depressed global conditions, as well 

as labor unrest and electricity shortages which compounded structural constraints. This weak growth is 

well-below the projected 5 percent growth needed to drive down unemployment. Inflation was relatively 

subdued in 2015 amid lower food and fuel prices (5.2 percent as of December 2015, up from 4.8 percent 

in November). However the Reserve Bank increased the repurchase rate by a total of 125 basis points 

from start 2015 to end March 2016 due to a deterioration of the inflation outlook as a result of the effects 

from rising food prices due to the drought, the risk of a higher pass-through from the sharp depreciation 

of the rand (depreciated by more than 30 percent against the dollar in 2015 and continued to weaken in 

January 2016, before showing a subsequent moderate recovery) and subdued global growth. 

A weaker growth environment will pose a challenge in the management of the fiscal deficit, which in 

turn increases the sovereign credit risk.  In an effort to mitigate sovereign credit risk, the National 

Budget Speech of February 2016 announced a strong fiscal adjustment effort, bringing the fiscal deficit 

from 3.9 percent of GDP for 2015/16 to 2.8 percent by 2017/18. The original target of the 2015 budget 

had been 2.5 percent, however deterioration in the growth outlook rendered the target unrealistic. In 

December 2015, Fitch and Standard and Poor’s (S&P) downgraded South Africa’s creditworthiness 

rating to BBB-, one notch above speculative grade, and S&P placed its rating on negative watch. The 

turmoil in markets experienced in December 2015 when a weakening in the government’s commitment 

to fiscal discipline was perceived, hints at the potential fallout from a further ratings downgrade.  

A substantial reduction in poverty and inequality will be hard to achieve without a major success in rural 

development. As stated by South Africa’s National Development Plan (NDP), the main challenge for 

rural development in South Africa is to “combat the marginalization of the poor”. While the rural share 

of poverty fell from 70 percent in 1993 to 58.3 percent in 2011, partly due to migration of the poor to 

townships and informal settlements around urban centers, rural areas remain characterized by greater 

poverty and inequality than urban areas.  The contraction in agricultural production at double-digit 

rates in the first three quarters of 2015, as extreme weather conditions related to El Nino led to the most 

severe drought in almost 20 years, pushed an estimated 50,000 South Africans into poverty. 

Agriculture development and successful land reform are key pillars of the strategy laid out by the NDP 

for integrated and inclusive rural development. South Africa’s agriculture sector is characterized by 

dualism: a modern, market-oriented capital intensive farming sector consisting of a small number of 

large commercial farms (around 40,000 farming units) and a large number of subsistence and 

small-scale or emerging farms, many in the former homeland areas. In addition, there is growing 

consolidation in the industry with a number of mergers taking place and the acquisition of smaller 

players. While improving economies of scale, this consolidation may also lead to lower competition in 

the market. Around 2006, over 80 percent of South African farmers worked on a piece of land of one 

hectare or smaller, and another 11 percent on one to five hectares. Only 3 percent had access to land of 

larger than 20 hectares. It is estimated that there are 2.5 – 3.5 million households engaged in subsistence 

farming, about 350,000 – 700,000 who can be classified as emerging farmers, producing part of their 

output for the market, and between 11,000 – 15,000 small to medium scale farmers who are 

commercially oriented. 

The progress of land reform has been slow and a large number of land reform beneficiaries are not using 

the land productively. The government committed itself to transfer 30 percent of the 82 million hectares 

of agricultural land owned by whites in 1994 to historically disadvantaged farmers by 2014, a total of 

24.5 million hectares, through both land restitution and land redistribution. According to the Twenty 

Year Review published by the Presidency, only 9.4 million hectares have been redistributed since 1994 

through both land restitution and redistribution. Achieving the objective of “productive use” of 

redistributed and restituted land requires even greater efforts and innovation. Land reform in South 

Africa to date has involved the transfer of relatively large commercial farms in their entirety to groups of 



beneficiaries. Land reform beneficiaries are typically resource-poor, risk-averse, and inexperienced 

historically disadvantaged farmers. Support provided to them after their takeover of the land, that is 

post-settlement support, has been inadequate. Land reform beneficiaries have experienced numerous 

problems accessing services, such as credit, training, technology extension, transport, plowing services, 

veterinary services, and marketing services. The well-developed agribusiness sector that services 

large-scale commercial agriculture has not been seen extending its operations to emerging farmers who, 

in most cases, would be cash-strapped and incapable of paying for such services anyway. As a 

consequence, there is limited integration of small farmers into the value chain.  

Support for small-scale farmers is equally crucial to job creation. Employment in the formal agriculture 

sector declined from 1.1 million in 1992 to 739,000 in 2014 despite output growth. Nevertheless, the 

NDP believes that with successful rural development and land reform the agriculture sector has the 

potential to create 1 million new jobs by 2030. The NDP counts on small-scale/ emerging farmers for 

over 35 percent of the job creation target, in addition to a 10 percent share from subsistence farmers, a 10 

percent share expected from better use of the land that has already been redistributed or restituted to land 

reform beneficiaries, and a 30 percent share from expansion of labor intensive commercial farming.   

 
 

Sectoral and institutional Context 

 

South Africa’s financial sector is the most developed in Sub-Saharan Africa and is significantly larger 

and more diversified compared to regional and income-group peers. It is supported by an elaborate legal 

and financial infrastructure and a generally effective regulatory framework. South Africa’s financial 

system totaled approximately ZAR 10 trillion in assets as of year-end 2014 (US$ equivalent of 1,026 

billion). As of end 2014, the banking sector constitutes almost 40 percent of the financial system assets, 

with pension funds and long-term insurers each contributing roughly 35 and 18 percent, respectively. 

The banking sector is highly concentrated, but at the same time commercially driven and professional. 

The ‘big four’ banks in South Africa, two of which are foreign owned, account for over 83 percent of 

total banking assets. This concentrated ownership structure has led to limited competition and distorted 

incentives for these banks to serve the lower end of the market, especially micro, small, and 

medium-sized enterprises and the low-income population. Nevertheless, the banking system generally is 

highly professional and commercially driven, and does not suffer from distortionary policies.   

Provision of agricultural finance and support  

One of the main challenges for rural and agriculture development is affordable access to working capital 

for emerging farmers and medium to long-term finance for small and medium-sized agricultural 

enterprises. While the financial services needs of the large commercial farms are generally well catered 

for by the private sector, farmers in rural areas experience many of the challenges faced by their peers in 

other African countries, ranging from difficulties in accessing markets, poor infrastructure, and little or 

no physical assets that could be used as collateral for accessing financing. With few exceptions, 

emerging and small-scale farmers are unable to use the land that they farm on as collateral given that the 

state owns most of the land in the former homelands. FinScope’s 2010 Small Business Survey estimates 

that of the roughly 700,000 emerging and small commercial farmers, only 5.6 percent used formal credit 

services and only 2.5 percent from a bank. In contrast, nearly half of those farmers used formal savings 

and/ or payments services and about 30 percent formal insurance. 

Without adequate collateral, rural farmers face challenges in accessing credit from traditional 

commercial banks. While the ‘big four’ commercial banks have made efforts to become more inclusive, 

their business models and cost structure do not lend themselves to serving the agricultural sector. Some 



banks are funding value chain off-take agreements with large processors and retailers for on-lending to 

smaller farmers, but such lending is small compared to the overall loan book of commercial banks. 

According to the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF), total farming debt 

amounted to ZAR 116,576 million (US$10,137 million) in 2014, out of which ZAR 66,345 million 

(US$5,769 million) was from commercial banks and ZAR 30,580 million (US$2,659 million) from the 

Land Bank. Compared to total commercial bank loans and advances of ZAR 2,967 billion (US$258 

billion), agricultural lending amounts to about 1 percent of their total loan book. 

A wide range of programs have been implemented by the government to provide financial support to 

land reform beneficiaries and small-scale farmers. In 1994 the government introduced the 

Settlement/Land Acquisition Grant (SLAG) to enable individuals and groups to finance the purchase of 

land from a willing seller. Until 2000, redistribution policy centered on the provision of a grant of ZAR 

16,000 (~US$1,034) to qualifying households with an income of less than ZAR 1,500 (~US$97) a 

month. In 2001 the Land Redistribution for Agricultural Development (LRAD) Grant was introduced to 

establish and promote emerging farmers. LRAD offered higher grants, paid to individuals rather than to 

households, and made greater use of loan financing through institutions such as Land Bank to 

supplement the grant. A few years later, the slow pace of land reform led to the introduction of the 

Proactive Land Acquisition Strategy (PLAS) in 2005-06. The use of grants for land acquisition was 

discontinued and the focus was shifted to the acquisition of strategically located land through PLAS by 

the state. Since its inception, PLAS has become the biggest single program area within redistribution, in 

terms of both budget and land area. 

There are also initiatives designed to provide post-settlement support to land reform beneficiaries. The 

LRAD policy for example sets out to close the post-settlement support gap that prevailed under SLAG. 

In addition, the Comprehensive Farmer Support Program (CFSP) provides two grants, one for capacity 

building and one for on-farm infrastructure. In order to access on-farm infrastructure grants ranging 

from a minimum of ZAR 5,000 to a maximum of ZAR 100,000 (~ US$323 to 6,462), beneficiaries must 

make an ‘own contribution’ along a sliding scale similar to that of the LRAD grant program. It is a 

once-off support package designed for LRAD beneficiaries. The Comprehensive Agricultural Support 

Program (CASP) supported by DAFF offers grants to support short-term operating expenses and small 

operating needs such as machinery. These grants are managed at the provincial level and come from 

funds that are transferred from the national to the provincial level. Combined land acquisition grants, 

both for redistribution and restitution, totaled ZAR 13.6 billion (US$1.61 billion) between 2008 and 

2012 while grants for movable equipment and fixed improvements amounted to ZAR 3.4 billion 

(US$1.58 billion) between 2004 and 2012 (DAFF). Borrowing for working capital needs to operate and 

expand farms has been one of the most acute challenges for emerging and small farmers as well as land 

reform beneficiaries due to the reasons mentioned above.  

Value chain integration is an opportunity to address significant skills and financing gaps of emerging 

farmers. In South Africa, there is a growing recognition in government and the private sector that value 

chain integration may be an effective way of building up a new class of commercial emerging farmers. 

Drawing on the successful experiences in the sugar, poultry, cotton, tobacco and forestry sectors, the 

government and private sector are joining forces to scale up efforts in these and other sectors. A new 

area opening for value chain integration is in the supply of fresh fruits and vegetables to retail 

supermarkets. With new BBBEE procurement policies government is encouraging the private sector to 

get involved. For example, Walmart-Massmart has established a supplier fund to support emerging 

farmer integration into their supply chain. The South African Poultry Association through the creation 

of the Developing Poultry Farmers Organization (DPFO) facilitates technical and financial assistance to 

access contracts with egg and poultry businesses. 



Land Bank 

In addition to government grants, financing from Land Bank has been expected to play a critical role in 

land reform and agriculture development. Land Bank was established in 1912 and is governed by the 

Land and Agricultural Development Bank Act of 2002. Land Bank was given a mandate of 11 aspects, 

which fall into five broader areas: (i) access of the historically disadvantaged population to land; (ii) 

agriculture productivity, growth and job creation; (iii) gender equity; (iv) environmental sustainability; 

and (v) food security. The NDP published in 2011 continues to call for a key role of Land Bank in 

providing financial support to land reform beneficiaries and to help them overcome difficulties in entry 

into commercial farming. 

As the leading development financial institution in the rural and agriculture sector in South Africa, Land 

Bank had an approximately 29 percent market share in agricultural financing as of July 2015. The bank 

has achieved a significant turnaround during the past five years. It is now on a sustainable trajectory with 

profits of ZAR 420 million in 2014/15 (up 61 percent from 2013/14), and a Return on Average Assets of 

1.12 percent and a Return on Average Equity of 6.78 percent. Total assets stood at ZAR 39.4 billion in 

2014/15 with a performing loan book of ZAR 36 billion. Non-performing loans (NPLs) under Land 

Bank methodology were at 3.72 percent in 2014/15 and the cost-to-income ratio was 54.9 percent. Fitch 

Ratings upgraded Land Bank from AA to AA+ in January 2014. The rating was maintained at AA+ in 

December 2015. The bank does not take general deposits and funds itself mainly through the debt and 

capital markets, issuing instruments such as promissory notes.  

Land Bank is fully owned by the South African government and supervised by the National Treasury. It 

follows prudential guidelines as issued by its Board of Directors. It is consequently not prudentially 

supervised by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB). The bank is audited by the Auditor General. 

Land Bank is engaged in both wholesale lending through intermediaries as well as direct lending. 

Intermediaries are mainly credit providers, cooperatives, or agri-businesses.  

In 2015, Land Bank adopted a new strategy following the completion of its organizational review. The 

review was undertaken following conditions set by NT pursuant to the issue of a Government guarantee, 

aimed at enabling the Land Bank to raise longer term funding. The review was completed in August 

2015 and subsequently an implementation plan was approved by the Land Bank Board. Land Bank has 

started implementing the new strategy and key changes are planned to be put in place over a two-year 

period in line with the priorities of Land Bank. The changes focus on: (i) a strategy to optimize the retail 

commercial banking segment of Land Bank, the long term viability of which was a concern owing to 

loan losses and significant operational costs; (ii) new initiatives to potentially expand the development 

portfolio of Land Bank for emerging farmers in a sustainable and commercially viable manner by 

adopting a project finance approach in partnership with large corporates and intermediaries to integrate 

the emerging farmers into established value chains; and (iii) steps to align Land Bank financial 

soundness indicators, credit appraisal processes and risk management practices with international 

banking standards.  

Following the adoption of this new strategy, Land Bank has two main business lines: Corporate Banking 

(CB) and Commercial Development Banking (CDB). The new CDB business line is a combination of 

previous Retail Emerging Markets (REM) and Retail Commercial Banking (RCB) business lines. In 

2014/15, CB accounted for 83.6 percent of the bank’s loan book and CDB accounted for 16.4 percent, of 

which 1.3 percent was composed of loans provided under REM. 

Under CDB, the REM sub-business line continues to focus exclusively on lending to emerging farmers 

for development purposes. Farmers supported under REM typically have no or limited access to 

commercial funding and little or no collateral, but can be commercially sustainable and viable with 



financing and technical support. Subsistence farmers are not supported under REM. Lending is based on 

cash-flows and non-financial support (end to end on-farm support) is provided by Land Bank 

intermediaries and agricultural specialists based in Land Bank branches. REM uses wholesale as well as 

direct lending and offers production financing, installment sale finance, and medium-term loans. The 

total REM portfolio amounted to ZAR 489 million in 2014/15 (increase of ZAR 97 million in that year).  

Intensive and high-quality extensions services under the REM program are effectively provided by Land 

Bank’s intermediaries. These intermediaries have a comparative advantage in providing these services 

due to their close interaction with the beneficiaries. The non-financial complementary services, 

especially extension services, are critical for emerging farmers to develop. The costs for the extension 

services are embedded in the overall cost structure under REM and are borne by the intermediaries. 

While the provision of extension services is costly, especially for new emerging farmers, intermediaries 

can generate profits from these clients over time due to the long-run and comprehensive nature of 

engagement between intermediaries and their clients. The current model of providing extension services 

is considered to be of high quality according to the assessment carried out during project preparation. 

Under CDB, the RCB business line which was exclusively focused on direct retail lending to medium 

scale farmers, through 27 Agriculture Finance Centers (AFCs), has been significantly restructured to 

improve its long term sustainability. RCB was loss-making due to high operating costs of the large 

branch network and had NPLs of 11 percent in 2014/15. RCB was losing clients to commercial banks 

and agricultural enterprises who started to lend in that space and could offer a wider range of products. 

The competitiveness and long-term viability of RCB was therefore questionable. The new strategy aims 

at consolidating the branch network into 9 provincial offices in strategically important geographical 

locations which will also result in significant staff reduction. Importantly, the consolidated branch 

network’s role will specifically focus on facilitating effective partnerships in their respective regions 

with corporate retailers, emerging farmers, government programs, as well as technical and financial 

intermediaries to leverage on high impact and high value chain finance deals. 

Importantly, as part of the new strategy, Land Bank aims to scale up financing support to emerging 

farmers in a sustainable and commercially viable manner through their integration in established value 

chains. The approach is anchored in identifying high-potential value chain projects in a given 

geographic region and securing buy-in from large agriculture corporates or technical partners to assist in 

supporting emerging farmers’ integration into the chain. The agriculture corporates will provide 

technical support (directly or indirectly) to the emerging farmers, building up their capacity to be 

sustainable suppliers to the chain. Land Bank has identified selected potential value chain projects and 

agriculture corporates to partner with in the grains, winery, horticulture and livestock sectors for this 

type of financing. 

The CB business line is the corporate part of the bank and the most viable business line. The CB 

business line involves both direct and wholesale lending. Lending takes place primarily through 

intermediaries (cooperatives and agri-businesses). CB operates through two offices in Pretoria and Cape 

Town. The total portfolio of CB amounted to ZAR 31 billion in 2014/15. While CB targets commercial 

farmers, the workers employed on these farm tend to be part of the low-income population.  

Land Bank aims at increasing its developmental focus in both CB and CDB business lines by 

strengthening its wholesale business as well as its direct lending to emerging farmers. Both business 

lines contain a development portfolio with “development” referring to a focus on supporting the 

historically disadvantaged population in line with Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment 

(BBBEE). International experience with development banks suggests that wholesale lending is more 

likely to be successful than retail lending. The key reason is that wholesale lending does not require a 

large branch network which is costly to build and maintain but rather leverages the networks already 



built by other financial service providers. Wholesale lending is also more market enabling and does not 

aim at competing with the private sector.  Direct lending via value chain financing leverages the 

corporate partner’s ability to provide technical support to the borrower, building up their capacity to be 

sustainable suppliers to the chain. As such, emerging farmers in this scheme have the potential to 

increase their revenues and thus a greater likelihood of fulfilling debt obligations to the bank. The 

project will therefore focus on supporting Land Bank in scaling up its wholesale portfolio as well as 

expanding direct lending through LB’s new approach of integrating emerging farmers into established 

value chains. Using long-term financing to fill existing funding gaps will additionally help Land Bank 

meet its investment needs as well as improve its asset liability management.  

Land Bank is making an important contribution to job creation. Land Bank estimates that the impact of 

its loan disbursements on employment opportunities in South Africa was close to 400,000 in 2013-2014. 

This estimate is comprised of over 23,000 new employment opportunities generated and over 370,000 

jobs maintained during the year. One employment opportunity constitutes 240 days worked per year. 

The estimated new jobs created are arising out of the medium and long-term loans Land Bank is 

providing.  

II. Project Development Objective(s) 

 
The project’s development objective is to sustainably scale up Land Bank’s financing, specifically to 

benefit emerging farmers. 

III. Project Description

 Line of Credit for Agricultural Financing 

 Comments (optional) 

 

Land Bank will provide both wholesale finance to participating PFIs for on-lending to commercial 

and emerging farmers and direct financing, in partnership with large agriculture corporates, to 

emerging farmers to support their integration in established value chains. It will do so through two 

main financing windows 

Window 1: Wholesale finance to commercial and emerging farmers. This window will provide a 

wholesale line of credit to Land Bank. Land Bank will on-lend the funds to participating financial 

intermediaries (PFIs) which comply with eligibility criteria agreed with the World Bank. The PFIs 

will on-lend funds to eligible agriculture enterprises, commercial and emerging farmers, communal 

property associations and other eligible borrowers supported under the Land Bank’s CB and CDB 

business lines. Currently, the wholesale line under CDB primarily includes the REM portfolio, 

however, over the life of the project this may change to include other wholesale loans under CDB. 

Window 2: Financing to integrate emerging farmers into established value chains. This window will 

provide a line of credit to Land Bank to finance direct lending to emerging farmers for integrated value 

chain finance. For direct lending to value chain finance/development projects, Land Bank will finance 

eligible emerging farmers and agriculture enterprises in collaboration with large agriculture 

corporates and/or technical partners in a targeted value chain.

a Line of Credit for Agricultural Financing in the amount of US$95 million. 

 

The loan will be extended to Land Bank as the borrower and implementing agency with a guarantee of 

the Republic of South Africa. Land Bank will use the funds under the LOC component for on-lending to 

PFIs. Land Bank will be responsible for project implementation and monitoring. Dedicated staff in Land 

Bank has been identified for managing all aspects of the project, including reporting on implementation 

progress and monitoring and evaluation, ensuring compliance with environmental and social safeguards 

as well as with financial management and procurement arrangements. 

 

Land Bank will report on the PDO and intermediate indicators on a semi-annual basis. The data will 

come from Land Bank’s internal reports and from information provided by the PFIs. Land Bank will 

prepare quarterly Interim Financial Reports for the project. The specific reporting templates will be 

defined in the Project’s Operational Manual. Land Bank’s financial performance will be audited 

annually by the Auditor General.

Other Decision (as needed) 
 
 
B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

1. The Republic of Congo (ROC) is sparsely inhabited, with a population of 4.4 million people 
and ranks among the least densely populated in the world (12.8/km

2
). The country has an   

urbanization rate of about 62 percent, with more than half of the population living in 

Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire, its two largest cities. Oil’s share of total GDP increased from 

56 percent in 2000-2004 to 66 percent in 2010-2014 and – despite the recent oil price decline 

– still accounts for more than half of GDP and more than 80 percent of total exports. 

Agricultural exports (palm oil, sugar, and cocoa) are stagnant and the country suffers from a 

rapidly deteriorating trade balance for food. ROC’s cereal import dependency ratio is 94 

percent
1
.  

 

2. ROC is highly endowed in natural resources, but with poor social indicators. The 
country is largely covered by the Congo Forest Basin, with 31 percent of its total surface area 

comprising cultivable land. The country is also endowed with significant hydrocarbon 

reserves with an estimated 1.6 billion barrels of oil reserves and with a proven 90 billion m
3
 

of natural gas, respectively the 4
th

 largest oil reserves and the 5
th

 largest natural gas reserves 

in Sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, the country is significantly endowed in mining ore such 

as iron, potash and magnesium. However, ROC’s key social indicators, notably health and 

education outcomes, as well as service delivery in these sectors, are much lower than 

countries with similar resource endowments, evidence of the Country’s inability to harness 

its potential into dividends for its citizens. 

 

3. High vulnerability of the economy and inequality. Despite steady GDP growth of 5 
percent over the past 10 years, ROC continues to suffer from high rates of poverty and 

inequality due to jobless growth. 63 percent of the population are self-employed in either 

agriculture or the informal services, with youth severely affected by unemployment. The 

unemployment rate for those aged 15-29 is 32.7 percent.
2
 The country has a Gini coefficient 

of 0.45 with a poverty incidence of 74.8 percent in rural areas against 32.3 percent in urban 

areas. Gender and disability have an indirect impact on poverty as women and disabled 

persons exhibit lower levels of education and employment opportunities. The ROC’s Gender 

Inequality country index is 137 out of 157 countries. Cultural division of labor and a 

preference for boys regarding expenditure on education often work against women. The 

malnutrition rate remains high (32 percent), with a total of 1.4 million people estimated as

malnourished
3
 and 31 percent of children stunted. Food and nutrition insecurity is driven by: 

(a) inadequate access to quality food; (b) poor hygiene practices and lack of awareness of 

food and nutrition requirements; and (c) unsafe food.    

 

4. Business climate and access to financial services. ROC was listed the 177
th

 country out of 

190 in the ranking of the World Bank Doing Business report 2017, which noted it takes an 

average of 50 days to register a business well beyond the regional average of 27.3. Access to 

finance is cited as the second highest constraint by businesses
4
. Bank credit to agriculture 

accounts for 6 percent of short-term credit and 17 percent of medium-term credit, and is 

focused primarily on the forestry industry
5
. Microfinance institutions are mostly focused on 

urban markets, and agriculture accounts for only 2 percent of Mutuelles Congolaises 

d’Epargne et de Crédit (MUCODEC)’s portfolio (the largest microfinance institution). Low 

penetration of financial services in rural areas, knowledge of the agriculture sector and 

collateral requirements limit access to credit for producer groups and micro, small and 

medium agribusiness enterprises (MSME).  

 

5. Private sector development. The private sector in ROC is largely fragmented with little or 
no structured public-private dialogue taking place to improve the enabling environment for 

business. The contribution of the private sector to growth is limited, as reflected by the level 

of private investments (excluding oil), which represents only 5 percent of GDP (against 14 

percent on average in Sub-Saharan Africa and 25 percent of GDP in Asia). Sectors with 

strong growth potential identified by the Government include transport services, 

agribusiness, forestry and mining. 

 

6. Environment. As part of its Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation 
(REDD+) agenda, ROC is developing an Emissions Reductions Program in the Sangha and 

Likouala departments. The government program seeks to access a variety of REDD+ funding 

sources like the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF), the Forest Investment Program 

(FIP), and the Central Africa Forest Initiative (CAFI). ROC’s forests are at risk of 

deforestation due to mineral extraction, road development, illegal logging, agricultural 

expansion and charcoal collection. In addition, trends
6
 indicate that exposure to periods of 

intense rainfall has been increasing. ROC, in its recently submitted Intended Nationally 

Determined Contribution (INDC), has highlighted agriculture among its priority areas. 

Climate actions with regards to agriculture will embrace adaptation and mitigation through 

the promotion of agro-forestry plantations, an increase in the number of producer 

associations, and production of bioenergy.

Sectoral and Institutional Context 

7. Agriculture, including forestry, employs about 40 percent of the labor force and contributes 
5 percent of GDP. Approximately 498,000 people are actively engaged in agricultural 

production, of which 70 percent are female. With an average rainfall of 1,200 mm per year 

and only 2 percent of the 10 million hectares of arable land exploited, the agricultural sector 

holds potential for growth. ROC has three types of agricultural production systems: (i) 

subsistence agriculture, mainly composed of small-scale producers farming 1 to 2 hectares 

per household, and accounts for 90 percent of agricultural output. Subsistence producers 

cultivate primarily staple crops such as plantain, cassava, ground nuts, maize, potatoes, 

beans, banana, and yam. Yields of these crops are lower on average than in other Sub-

Saharan countries mainly due to the poor quality of planting materials, the low use of 

fertilizer and the limited access to improved technologies and mechanization; (ii) urban and 

peri-urban agriculture is mainly composed of producers with small-scale gardens and semi-

modern commercial farms producing for urban consumers; and (iii) agro-industrial 

production systems, mainly monocultures geared towards export markets or niche urban 

markets. Apart from that of sugar cane, the production of traditional export and cash crops 

(e.g. coffee, cocoa, palm oil and rice) collapsed over the past couple of decades. A few large 

private agribusiness investors have recently started to invest again in these crops (including 

large-scale maize cultivation and the revival of palm oil and cocoa plantations). 

 

8. The cumulative effects of the different production systems have left an undeniable 
impact on the environment. Studies revealed that the sector contributes a total of 79 percent 

of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
7
. Subsistence farming has promoted deforestation 

through slash and burn shifting cultivation techniques. As a result, particularly in the 

Province of Plateau, producers are experiencing: (i) earlier planting times and longer crop 

cycles; (ii) soil degradation, which makes some crops no longer suitable; and (iii) greater 

occurrences of flooding. Lastly, peri-urban vegetable and fish farming are competing with 

growing demand for water from urban dwellers. 

 

9. Gender in agriculture. Women are underrepresented in politics and higher levels of 
government, even though the Family Code protects them against racial, ethnic and sexual 

discrimination. Women earn less than men and are more likely to be self-employed as they 

do not have equal opportunities for accessing secondary education and paid employment. 

Labor market analyses show that gender employment gaps result from unequal access to 

education and skills training. Lack of education gives women limited power in business and 

social dealings with men, who typically are better educated. Women are customarily 

encouraged to focus on subsistence farming, family and child-rearing activities (fertility rate 

is high at 3.8 percent) and, as a result, 70 percent of the country’s agricultural workforce are 

women. Congolese women face additional barriers compared to men in accessing credit, 

agriculture inputs, land ownership and labor.   

 

10. Agricultural skills, competencies and jobs. Access to formal paid wage job is very limited

for the youth who are more likely to be unemployed. If they manage to find a job, those aged 

15-29 are more likely to be employed by a household (15 percent) or by an SME (12 

percent)
8
. There is only one institute for higher education in agriculture, Ecole Nationale 

Supérieure d’Agronomie et de Foresterie (ENSAF), with approximately additional 7 

agriculture vocational skills training centers. They are under resourced and do not offer all of 

the relevant skills and entrepreneurship training. Internship arrangements with the private 

sector are difficult to organize and the capacity to train masters and doctoral students is 

limited. 

  

11. Demand for food is high and growing in domestic and regional markets. ROC is highly 
dependent on food imports, with a negative trade balance. Food imports increased from US 

$197 million to US$240 million between 2007 and 2013, and spiked to US$353 million in 

2011. Volumes of imported food in 2013 included 104,567 tons of wheat, 50,581 tons of 

palm oil, 45,878 tons of chicken meat, 41,541 tons of rice and 38,455 tons of wheat flour
9
.
 

The domestic cassava market is valued at US$ 174 million with some value addition already 

taking place. Cassava is consumed by 90 percent of the population. There is a high 

consumption of chicken at household level and consumption of other livestock products is 

expected to grow significantly, e.g. 80 million eggs and 15,000 tons of pork per annum by 

2020
10

. Demand for milk (and milk-based products) is high and growing. Fish consumption 

is at 24.4 kg per head per year, one of the highest in Africa. Other regional markets present 

sizable opportunities as well, for instance the Kinshasa market (over 12 million inhabitants) 

in the Democratic Republic of Congo, or other neighboring countries such as Angola, Gabon 

and Cameroon.  

 

12. Food safety concerns are huge and compounded by the absence of a food policy and 
regulatory framework. No analysis has been done to understand the national cost of food 

borne diseases (e.g. loss of human lives, cost of treatment and loss of income especially on 

poor households). Food safety issues from imports include: (i) food spoilage; (ii) absence of 

harmonized food and product standards; (iii) poor product quality (e.g. expired food, 

deceitful labelling and high levels of preservatives in food); (iv) limited coordinated national 

surveillance and inspection capacity; and (vi) no laboratories for food testing. In addition to 

the risks created by limited awareness amongst consumers and low levels of hygiene 

standards (e.g. unregistered food street vendors & unsanitary urban markets), additional food 

safety risks from domestic agriculture include: (i) the use of animal waste and sewage on 

crops as agriculture fertilizer; (ii) poor harvesting and post-harvest handling (raises risks of 

mycotoxins and aflatoxins); and (iii) unhygienic agricultural transport systems.          

 

13. Every segment across the agriculture value chain is characterized by under 
development and fragmentation. Most inputs are imported, at high cost with no quality 

assurance. Agricultural production is performed in a rudimentary, inefficient, low input-

output model making unit costs of production much higher than imported commodities. The

transport sector is managed by cartels that fix the transport prices, making it difficult for 

producers to transport commodities and processors to source primary material. There is only 

a few domestic agro-processing companies and the distribution and retail of food is done 

mostly through formal open markets, informal markets and small corner stores. There are 

only seven registered retail outlets (supermarkets) in urban areas selling mostly imported 

food.  

 

14. Commercial agricultural production is constrained by a multiplicity of factors. The 
competitiveness of domestic production – in value chains such as poultry, piggery, and fish 

for livestock, cassava and groundnuts for staple crops, and cocoa and palm oil for cash crops 

– is hampered by: (i) sector specific legislative and governance constraints (seed policies, 

land access, food safety policies and guidelines, taxes and registration procedures for the 

legal status of cooperatives); (ii) weak producer organizations (iii) non-existent agricultural 

extension and veterinary services and obsolete Research and Development (R&D) capacity;  
(iv) high costs of agricultural inputs (seeds, fertilizers, land, animal feed, credit); (v) an 

ageing and under skilled workforce; and  (vi) poor road and communication networks and 

costly logistics and energy services.  

 

15. A substantial number of smallholders have the potential to engage successfully in 
commercially demanding value chains.

11
 These producers are found amongst farms located 

outside cities and towns (urban and peri-urban) as well as within specific value chains (e.g. 

cocoa, palm oil).
12

 These producers work in groups but are often marginalized from higher-

value markets due to high unit costs of production, poor infrastructure and limited access to 

credit and technical assistance. Three main profiles have been identified in the ROC of SMEs 

that are currently operating in the agribusiness sector and could establish business 

relationships with producer groups for commercial agriculture: (i) suppliers of critical inputs 

(e.g. day-old chicks, veterinary medicine and technical assistance provided by 

Transcontinental Business Néerlandais (TBN) in Pointe-Noire); (ii) off-takers for agricultural 

products (e.g. tropical fruits to produce concentrate bought by Bayo in Brazzaville); and (iii) 

firms that are both input suppliers and off-takers (e.g. supplying cassava cuttings then 

purchasing of cassava for saka-saka processing by Agridec in Dolisie).

 M.H. Collion, Rural Productive Partnerships: An Inclusive Agribusiness Model for Overcoming Small-holder 
Market Barriers, World Bank, 2012. This finding is echoed by studies in Africa and Asia which indicate that 50-70% 
of farmers are unable to move out of subsistence (S. Ferris et alt., Linking Smallholder Farmers to Markets and the 
Implications for Extension and Advisory Services, MEAS Discussion Paper 4, 2014). 
12

 The Ministry of Agriculture holds a Registry of Farmer Cooperatives that totals 1,055 cooperatives nation-wide, 
out of which 25% (approximately 250) are estimated to be active according to a survey conducted by the Ministry 
in 2015.  According to records from ongoing projects (PDARP, PADE), there are approximately more than 500 
additional active producer groups that are not registered with the Ministry since they registered at the 
Department level or they decided to register as an Association with the Ministry of Interior instead. There are 
therefore approximately 800 active producer groups (associations/cooperatives) in Congo, totaling approximately 
16,000 smallholders.

17. Additional development challenges to be considered. The project will also help address 
nutrition and food insecurity by promoting producer groups’ access to nutrition and climate 

sensitive technology, agriculture extension services, and by supporting MSMEs to produce 

fortified and enriched foods in the market. Skills development and job creation for youth 

challenges (auto-employment, semi-permanent, temporary jobs, etc.) will be addressed 

through support to internship arrangements between institutes of higher learning and the 

private sector. 

The gender gap 

with respect to 

access to 

services, inputs 

and finance and 

ownership of 

economic 

resources will be 

reduced by 

promoting female 

producer groups’ 

access to 

matching grants. 

Female owned 

MSMEs will also 

be promoted 

through access to 

a tailored 

technical 

assistance 

package for 

women MSMEs 

(business 

leadership, 

entrepreneurship 

training, 

mentorship and networking support).  Targeting principles and the approaches by component 

are described in Box 1. 
 
 

A. Project Components 

Component 1: Direct support to producer groups and agribusiness MSMEs (IDA: US$25 million)  

18. Component 1 seeks to increase productivity and value addition along value chains, and 
improve food and nutrition security. Support provided under this component will be through 

a matching grant program financing technical assistance and productive investments to 

support production, marketing and processing activities. This component has two sub-

components. 

Box 1: Targeting Principles 

Two basic principles will guide project design: (i) an open menu approach with 

respect to the selection of value chains, subsectors and business opportunities; 

and (ii) a geographical concentration and targeting of project interventions where 

commercial opportunities and the need for support have been identified and 

expressed by market actors (producers, processors and others). The rationale for 

an open menu is to avoid excluding any potentially viable value chain and 

business opportunity. The project’s geographical focus will start where 

commercial agriculture has the strongest potential: the three main cities of 

Brazzaville, Pointe Noire and Dolisie and in the North of the country. In its first 

component, the project will directly support private sector initiative in agriculture 

by facilitating market access for producer groups and agribusiness MSMEs. 

Support to producer groups will follow a Productive Alliance approach through 

which these producer groups target new markets and seek to establish commercial 

relationships with buyers and off-takers. Support to MSMEs will focus on 

helping agribusiness firms to connect with specific off-takers and markets (both 

domestic and export), through  sound business plan development, supply chain 

development for sourcing quality raw materials, and access to know-how to 

improve processing techniques, relevant market information and/or equipment, 

etc.  

 

The second component will support public investments in agricultural service 

roads and other improved public infrastructure (e.g. access to electricity and 

water supply for agro-processing) selected based on the location (clustering) of 

the demand for sub-projects from producer groups and agribusiness MSMEs in 

Component 1. Producer groups and agribusiness MSMEs will need to identify 

(along with their expression of interest) if their value chain development activities 

are constrained by the lack of viable infrastructure. Activities in Component 2 

will also contribute to improving the business climate for commercial agriculture. 

Lastly, the project will support the strengthening of institutional capacities for 

commercial agriculture development in its third component.

Subcomponent 1.1: Sustainable intensification and commercialization of crop and animal 

production (IDA: US$ 20 million)  

19. Objective and instruments used. This subcomponent will support producer groups in 
Productive Alliance arrangements with buyers and markets for increased production, value 

addition and improved marketing of their products. It will support the intensification of 

production and commercialization of products within supported value chains through 

technical assistance and financing of business plans using a matching grant scheme 

administered through a Productive Alliance approach.  

 

20. Productive Alliance approach.
13

 Productive Alliances will aim to develop the managerial 

and technical capacity of producer groups and help them implement business plans that 

include support for productive investment (access to inputs, production facilities, nutrition 

and climate-sensitive technology) and technical assistance (agriculture advisory, extension 

services and business development skills and practices). The project will also seek to 

strengthen existing business arrangements between producer groups and buyers and/or 

support new ones.  

 

21. Business plans. Producer groups will be supported to translate their vision and strategy into 
a business plan that clearly identifies specific markets, marketing plans and technical and 

financial needs. Business plans are expected to finance a series of investments (depending on 

market requirements, the supply chain and associated constraints), such as: (i) improved 

access to quality inputs (e.g. seeds, cuttings, chicks, fertilizer, feed, water through small 

pumped and piped irrigation systems, etc.); (ii) infrastructure and/or equipment for 

processing; and (iii) infrastructure and/or equipment to improve the storage and transport to 

reach target markets. Investments will systematically be accompanied with technical 

assistance to install and maintain the investment and to improve the producer group’s 

marketing skills and management of its business and finances. The matching grants, 

however, will be awarded based on a competitive process. Applicants will have to meet a set 

of eligibility criteria to present their business plan, which will then be assessed on the basis 

of additional relevant prioritization criteria
14

. In forest areas, application of REDD+ 

principles will for instance be a precondition for relevant value chains. Female producer 

groups will receive tailored technical assistance that will include business leadership 

networking support to enable them to access markets and manage business operations.

Subcomponent 1.2: Development of agro-industrial activities (IDA: US$ 5 million) 

22. Objective and instruments used. This subcomponent will support the competitiveness of 
MSMEs involved in agribusiness, from input supply to the production, processing and 

distribution of agricultural products, as well as the delivery of agri-based services. These 

actors face efficiency challenges linked to the cost of processing, packaging and marketing 

their products. Efficiency gains in operations will result in higher quality agricultural 

products (nutritional and safety standards compliant), jobs (full, part-time and seasonal), and 

a secure market that rewards farmers with quality produce with higher prices. Female owned 

MSMEs will access a technical assistance plus package (business leadership, 

entrepreneurship training, with additional mentorship and networking support) to support 

them to bridge specific gender related challenges. This subcomponent will aim to allow 

MSMEs to have better access to training, equipment and skills they need to develop their 

business. 

 

23. Business plans. Agribusiness MSMEs will be able to apply for grants on a competitive basis 
through the same matching-grant scheme as the one described for Subcomponent 1.1. They 

will have to submit a business plan that identifies market demand for the firm’s products and 

services and shows returns on investment and financial sustainability of the firm’s 

operations, while clearly demonstrating that the investment contributes to addressing at least 

one of the following challenges: product upgrade, process improvement, new product 

development, volume increase, or reduction of the environmental footprint. The matching 

grants will cover technical assistance and equipment. Technical assistance will systematically 

accompany equipment requests to ensure the proper use and maintenance of the investment. 

Eligibility and prioritization criteria will be applied to maximize the transparency of the 

Promotion plans and 

activities targeting 

potential members of 

productive alliances. 

This process 

continues during the 

call for proposals 

phase.

Public calls for 

potential productive 

alliance partners (i.e. 

producer groups, 

input suppliers, 

buyers, etc.) to 

present business 

plans. 

The calls will be 

accompanied by a 

communications 

campaign, as well as 

field information and 

training workshops.

Component 2: Improving public infrastructure and the business climate for commercial 

agriculture (IDA: US$ 45 million) 
24. This component aims to foster the development of commercial agriculture by lifting 

constraints in terms of infrastructure and business climate. This component consists of two 

sub-components:  

 

Subcomponent 2.1: Public infrastructure for the development of commercial agriculture (IDA: US$ 

37 million)  

25. Objective and instruments used. This subcomponent will contribute to the development of 
basic infrastructure essential for the promotion of commercial agriculture and the emergence 

of an agro-industry. It will include public investments in the rehabilitation and maintenance 

of the feeder road network and improved access to other public infrastructure (e.g. access to 

electricity and water supply for agro-processing, and other public infrastructure) in a targeted 

way.  

 

26. Prioritization criteria. High logistical costs and limited access to markets are major 
obstacles faced by the private sector. To address these important issues, the project will make 

a provision to ensure public investments in infrastructure: (i) are identified by the 

Government as infrastructure of a public nature; and (ii) are located in targeted geographic 

zones where producer groups and MSMEs promoting commercial agriculture development 

express interest in receiving Productive Alliance and / or MSME support (see Component 1). 

 

27. Sustainability of investments. Technical assistance will also be provided through this 
subcomponent to selected departmental councils to implement the new road maintenance 

strategy developed with the assistance of the Agricultural Development and Rural Roads 

Rehabilitation Project (PDARP) in order to make such maintenance more sustainable.  

 

Subcomponent 2.2: Governance and regulatory framework for commercial agriculture (IDA: US$ 8 

million) 

28. Objective and instruments used. This subcomponent aims to improve the legal and 
regulatory framework for commercial agriculture. It will do so by: (i) establishing and 

financing platforms for public-private dialogue on commercial agriculture at the 

departmental and national levels to identify needed reforms; (ii) providing technical 

assistance to draft the identified legislation and regulations; (iii) policy advocacy with 

parliamentarians (e.g. policy notes, sensitization, training); and (iv) conducting sensitization, 

dissemination and training activities toward relevant stakeholders (i.e. ministries and public 

institutions, producer groups, agribusiness MSMEs and other private sector actors, etc.) on 

drafted legislations and regulations pertaining to commercial agriculture. 

 

29. Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) on commercial agriculture. The project will build on the 
mechanism for public-private dialogue put in place with the support of PADE to start a

public-private dialogue specifically on commercial agriculture by providing technical 

assistance and budget support to set up and operate PPD platforms
16

 on commercial 

agriculture at the departmental and national levels. The platforms are expected to identify and 

contribute to building consensus around changes to legislation and practices that constrain 

commercial agriculture.    

 

30. Identified reforms. Some of the needed improvements to constraining legislation specific to 
commercial agriculture have already been identified with stakeholders and their drafting will 

be supported by the project. The legislation pertains to: (i) compliance with the Organisation 

pour l’Harmonisation du Droit des affaires en Afrique (OHADA) Uniform Act on 

Cooperatives; (ii) National Seed Policy in compliance with the norms of the Economic 

Community of Central African States (CEEAC); (iii) Rural Code to clarify and secure land 

access; and (iv) food safety policy and regulatory framework, standards and the certification 

of products
17

. 

 

Component 3: Strengthening institutional capacities to support the development of commercial 

agriculture (IDA: US$ 30 million) 

31. The objective of this component is to strengthen the capacity of public and non-public 
service providers involved in the implementation of project activities and / or supporting the 

development of commercial agriculture in the Republic of Congo. At the same time, it will 

ensure and oversee the successful management and implementation of the project, while 

making a provision to enable an immediate response in case of declared crisis or emergency. 

This component has three sub-components: 

 

Subcomponent 3.1: Capacity-building of institutions providing support to commercial agriculture 

(IDA: US$20 million) 

32. Objective and instruments used. The subcomponent will provide equipment, training and 
operating cost support to government and non-government actors that are necessary for 

commercial agriculture to succeed, including a number of technical departments of the

 When business practices and legislation identified by these sector-specific PPD platforms are economy-wide in nature (e.g. easing business 
entry and business exit, facilitating trade across borders, etc.), the project will share these inputs with PADE, which is better placed to address 
them. When identified reforms are specific to commercial agriculture, and if a strong consensus can be built with stakeholders from the public 
and private sectors around them, the project will provide support for their drafting through this subcomponent. 
17

 See Annex 1 for more detail on the reforms that have been identified.

 A list of the institutions identified for capacity-building support includes: (i) the Studies and Planning Department 
of MAEP; (ii) the Ministry of Scientific Research and Technical Innovation through the Institut National de 
Recherche Agronomique (IRA) and the Centre National de Semences Améliorées (CNSA), among others; (iii) the

Subcomponent 3.2: Project management, coordination and monitoring at national and provincial 

levels (IDA: US$ 10 million)  
34. This subcomponent will support project management, coordination, communication, 

monitoring and evaluation, adequate monitoring of the environmental and social safeguard 

policies, at the national level as well as at the departmental levels. Under this subcomponent, 

a strong fiduciary management system will be introduced and an effective monitoring and 

evaluation framework will be designed, which will not only monitor impact indicators, but 

will also ensure real time data collection that will facilitate the adoption of corrective 

measures in a timely manner and even attempt to integrate the data into the national 

agricultural statistics database.  

 

35. Through this subcomponent, the project will finance a baseline study, mid-term review study, 
final impact assessment, the recruitment of staff, consultancy services, the acquisition of 

property and equipment, and will support relevant seminars and training, as well as diverse 

operating costs to supervise the project activities. 

 
Component 4: Contingency emergency response (IDA: US$ 0.0M) 

36. This component will provide support for immediate response to an eligible crisis or 
emergency, as needed. A crisis or emergency eligible for financing is: an event that has 

caused, or is likely to imminently cause, a major adverse economic and/or social impact to 

the Borrower, associated with a natural or man-made crisis or disaster. Rapid disbursement 

of funds will allow the Government to request a reallocation of project funds to partially 

cover emergency response and recovery costs. This component will be triggered if: (i) the 

Government has determined that an eligible crisis or emergency has occurred and has 

furnished to the Bank a request to include said activities in the Contingency Emergency 

Response Component (CERC) for emergency response; (ii) the Government has prepared 

and disclosed all safeguards instruments required for said activities; (iii) the Borrower has 

adopted the CERC Operations Manual (OM) in form, substance and manner acceptable to the 

Bank. A specific OM for this component will be prepared detailing financial management, 

procurement, safeguards, and any other necessary implementation arrangements. While 

Components 1, 2 and 3 focus on pre-crisis disaster risk mitigation and climate resilience 

enhancement measures, Component 4 will help to strengthen the Government’s capacity to 

respond effectively to an eligible crisis or emergency. 
 
 
E. Implementation 
 
Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 

37. The institutional arrangements proposed for this project, under the supervision of the 

                                                                                                                                                                                           
Cooperative Action Department of MAEP and Agricongo among others; (iv) the Ministry of Higher Education 
through the Ecole Nationale Supérieure d'Agronomie et de Foresterie (ENSAF), among others; and (v) institutions

Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries (MAEP), includes the following supervisory 

and implementation bodies: (i) a Steering Committee; (ii) a National Coordination Unit of 

the project (including a Matching Grant scheme); (iii) Project Implementation Units at 

departmental level; (iv) technical service providers (public, private, NGOs); and (v) financial 

institutions, which will render financial services to the private sector (producer groups, 

agribusiness MSMEs) (See Figure 2). 

 

38. Public service providers will participate in the project through the structures of the MAEP, 
The ongoing reform of MAEP and the introduction of specialized agencies is an opportunity 

for re-thinking and repositioning the role of public technical services, including agriculture 

advisory and extension services.  

Steering Committee (CP)  
39. A high level Steering Committee will be officially established before effectiveness. It will be 

chaired by the Minister in charge of Agriculture and composed of representatives of key 

project stakeholders (relevant ministries, private sector, and civil society including producer 

groups) in the project. The Steering Committee will be responsible for the strategic direction, 

operational oversight, communication and overall good governance of the project. 

 

National Project Coordination Unit (NPCU)  

40. It is proposed that the current PDARP national project coordination unit, with a proven track 
record in administrative and fiduciary management, be retained and strengthened to 

coordinate and manage the Commercial Agricultural Project. The NPCU will be responsible 

for project implementation, management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and 

supervision. The NPCU will rely on specific expertise, including the hiring of an independent 

firm contracted for the management of the matching grant program of Component 1.  

 

Project Implementation Units (PIUs) 

41. Four Project Implementation Units will be established at departmental level to support 
specific zones targeted by the project. They will ensure project activity monitoring and 

evaluation as well as receive and process complaints related to the implementation of the 

project in collaboration with the authorities and civil society.  
 
 

 
 
 .    
F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 

The project envisages to target 3 main high potential agricultural zones as defined in the Schema National 
d’Amenagement du Territoire (National Spatial Master Plan). These are (i) agri-zone 1 South Corridor 
Brazzaville - Pointe Noire, (ii) agri-zone 2 Central Corridor Konda- Oyo-Lekye- Gambona, including special 
economic zone Oyo-Owando where fisheries and palm oil are being promoted; and (iii) agri-zone 3 North

SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

Activities from Subcomponent 1.1: Intensification of 
Agricultural and Livestock value chains; 
Subcomponent 1.2: Development of logistic, trade 
and business services; and Subcomponent 2.1: 
Public Infrastructure for Agribusiness and Agro 
industrial Development are expected to impact 
environment and these impacts are evaluated to be 
moderate, localized and manageable; so the project 
is classified to the EA category “B”. And the 
Environmental Safeguards Policies triggered are 
PO/PB 4.01 "Environmental Assessment"; PO/PB 
4.04 "Natural Habitats"; OP/PB 4.09 "Pest 
management and pesticides"; PO/PB 4.10 
"Indigenous Peoples"; PO/PB 4.11 "Physical Cultural 
Resources"; OP/PB 4.12 "Involuntary Relocation"; 
PO/PB 4.36 "Forests"; OP/PB 7.50 Projects relating 
to International Waterways; PO/PB 17.50: Right of 
access to information. 
To ensure that any environmental issues by the 
project activities are appropriately addressed, the 
safeguard instrument elaborated according OP/BP 
4.01 is the Environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF). This one is also designed to 
serve as a guide for developing ESIAs and ESMPs as 
needed, when the exact sites of sub-projects will be 
known. In particular, the ESIA will include a 
diagnostic of the project areas, potential 
environmental adverse impacts, potential issues 
related to labor influx, and mitigation measures to 
manage properly expected adverse impacts. The 
ESIA will highlight specific provisions that need to be 



 

The World Bank  
Congo Commercial Agriculture Project (P159979) 

 

 

  
Mar 22, 2017 Page 17 of 25  

 

included in construction/installation contracts to 
ensure that contractors’ ESMPs address relevant 
mitigation measures. 
The ESMF include specific sections to address all 
issues related to OP/BP 4.04 on Natural Habitats; 
OP/BP 4.36 on Forests and OP/BP 4.11 on Physical 
Cultural Resources. 
 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

OP/BP 4.04 is triggered to enable the project to 
perform the screening of the identified sites and 
their vicinities relative to natural habitats, the aim is 
to avoid project activities to create significant 
degradation of natural habitats. Project will also 
seek to identify appropriate conservation measures, 
follow-up, assessment and management of natural 
habitats within the project area. The Government 
will be encouraged to provide necessary information 
to the people and to provide them with the right 
incentives to protect and to support the 
conservation of natural habitats and to facilitate, if 
necessary, the rehabilitation of degraded habitats. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

This project could possibly impact the health and 
quality of forests or the rights and welfare of people 
and their level of dependence upon the interaction 
with forests, and it may lead to changes in the 
management, protection or utilization of natural 
forests or plantations. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

OP/BP 4.09 is triggered because the project supports 
activities that requires the use of pesticides, 
fertilizers, vaccines and other chemicals like in the 
production of eggs, of cattle feed and veterinary 
products in the poultry, goats, pigs, cattle, fish 
farming and aquaculture, and some projects 
activities will lead to a surge in the use of pesticides 
and fertilizers which can create negative effects on 
the environment. This policy supports the integrated 
pest control approaches. It identifies pesticides that 
can be financed under the project and develop an 
appropriate plan of pests to deal with risks. To 
comply with this policy a Plan of Management of 
Pests and Pesticides (PMPP) was prepared in 
separated document from the ESMF. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 
This policy, OP/BP 4.11, is triggered by the project 
because during implementation of project activities, 
it is possible to discover or to affect some cultural 



 

The World Bank  
Congo Commercial Agriculture Project (P159979) 

 

 

  
Mar 22, 2017 Page 18 of 25  

 

relics. The Physical Cultural Resources Policy aims to 
protect cultural resources, to avoid any significant 
conversion (loss) or degradation of these resources. 
To be in compliance with this policy, project has 
developed, into a separate document, the Physical 
Cultural Resources Framework (PCRF). 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

Indigenous Peoples are found on a large part of the 
Republic of Congo’s rural territory, and a number of 
the areas visited under project preparation and 
evaluation phase are known to inhabit Indigenous 
Peoples (IPs). This includes the Cuvette (Oyo-
Owando), in the Sangha (Ouesso), and Plateau (Oyo, 
Gamboma). Since the project will be implemented at 
the national level, with specific zones of 
interventions yet to be identified (based on targeted 
crops, agribusiness, and in accordance to the 
national agricultural plan), the project has prepared 
an Indigenous Peoples Policy Framework (IPPF), 
which will establish the framework for consultation 
and inclusion of IPs in the project areas. The project 
will identify various IPs associations and IP 
communities in the selected zones as collaborators, 
as well as potential CSOs and local NGOs. Once the 
specific sites are known, an Indigenous Peoples Plan 
(IPP) will be development, and it would identify the 
targeted IPs, and ensure their inclusion as 
beneficiaries of project activities, in a culturally 
appropriate and inclusive manner. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

Activities suggested in Component 2, Subcomponent 
2.2 “Public Infrastructure for Agribusiness and Agro 
industrial Development”, may require acquisition of 
land. Due to low population density in rural areas, 
however, the risk of physical resettlement is 
minimal, although there may be potential economic 
displacement or loss of assets.  
The project has prepared the Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) since the exact site locations are 
yet unknown, and eventually Resettlement Action 
Plans (RAP) or Abreviated Resettelement Action 
Plans (ARAP) will be prepared to mitigate potential 
negative impacts.  
This new project is to some regards an extension of 
the Agricultural Development and Rural Roads 
Rehabilitation Project (P095251, and Additional 
Finance P145627). The project established an escrow 



 

The World Bank  
Congo Commercial Agriculture Project (P159979) 

 

 

  
Mar 22, 2017 Page 19 of 25  

 

account of US $500,000 for resettlement 
compensation. Since the project did not require any 
land acquisition and therefore did not induce any 
resettlement (physical or economic displacement), 
no RAPs were prepared for the project. The funds in 
the escrow account remain unused, and the account 
will be transferred to the new project in order to 
fund potential compensation cases for the new 
Commercial Agriculture project.  
 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 
This Safeguard Policy is not trigged because no 
project activities involved in dams or located in their 
vicinities. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 

OP 7.50 is applicable to the Project because 
activities may have an impact on the Congo, 
Oubangui and Sangha river basins, all of which are 
international waterways. ROC is one of the riparians 
of the Congo-Oubangui-Sangha basin together with 
DRC, Central African Republic, Cameroon, Gabon, 
and Angola. The proposed Project covers primarily 
high potential agricultural zones around the main 
cities of Brazzaville, Pointe Noire and Dolisie, the 
south corridor along the national road from 
Brazzaville to Bouenza and Kouilou and the northern 
part of country, Sangha and Likouala. The planned 
rehabilitations of irrigation systems are very small in 
size. Most of these schemes will be located around 
the three big cities and markets of Brazzaville, Pointe 
Noire and Dolisie (using the rivers of Djoué, Niari, 
Kouilou … ), the country’s bread basket and where 
70% of the population live. The task team has 
carefully considered any potential impacts of the 
proposed investments, and because that: (i) the 
project will not cause appreciable harm to the 
riparian countries; and (ii) no activities are expected 
to have any adverse effects on the water quality or 
quantity, no notification is required under OP 7.50 
since the project deals only with micro/minor 
irrigation rehabilitation, and thus falls under the 
exception to the notification requirement under 
paragraph 7 (a) of the Policy. An exception memo 
has been prepared and was approved by the AFRVP 
on May 15, 2017. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No This Safeguard Policy is not triggered.

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
In agricultural development and infrastructure implementation, the expected negative impacts are inherent in 
deforestation and the loss of biodiversity; soil erosion, silting of rivers, degradation of water courses; pollutions and 
nuisances, the generation of construction waste, rubble and other demolition residues, disruption of activities on land 
rights, etc.  
In the operational phase, the risks relate to pollution and degradation of watercourses linked to the use of pesticides 
and fertilizers; pollution and nuisance due to solid and liquid waste from agricultural activities, pollution of the 
environment by sewage and solid waste disease, risk of accidents, risks (HIV / AIDS) and development of water-related 
diseases (malaria, bilharziasis), social conflicts related to local customs and practices; losses of land and socio-
economic income sources; influx of the population as a result of the installation of structuring facilities, strong 
pressure on land and water with increasing development.  
Terrestrial and aquatic habitats (wetlands) can be altered mainly during the start-up and implementation phase of 
agricultural. But globally, all these impacts are evaluated to be moderate, localized and manageable. 
 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
This project would increase agricultural productivity, enhance food security and nutrition. No adverse long term or 
indirect environmental or social impacts are expected. 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
There are no significant negative impacts of the project, designed on the contrary to have positive social and 
environmental impacts. No alternatives were therefore considered to avoid impacts. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Based on experience gained through the implementation of the Agricultural Development and Rural Roads 
Rehabilitation Project, a Category B project, the capacity of the Implementing Agency housed in the Ministry of 
Agriculture to implement the Bank’s environmental and social safeguards policies is considered high. An 
environmental specialist has been included as part of the PIU core team, and the project will recruit a social specialist. 
The two specialists will monitor and supervise the environmental and social measures as recommended in the various 
safeguards instruments for the project. The current environmental specialist, as well as the Project Coordinator have 
both benefitted from the World Bank organized capacity-building initiative in November 2016.   
Finally, to manage and monitor safeguards implementation in a timely manner, the PIU will prepare quarterly reports 
of the implementation of the safeguards instruments. The Project will equally ensure that all the instruments (in 
accordance with OP 4.01, OP 4.10, OP 4.11 and OP 4.12) put in place and the Grievance Redress Mechanisms (GRMs). 
The project will monitor indicators set forth in the safeguards instruments. To this extent, the two safeguards 
specialists in the PIU, will closely collaborate with the M&E specialist in the PIU, and reflect the findings in the 
quarterly reports. 
An important lesson learned under the previous Agriculture project was the poor management of grievances. The

Congo Commercial Agriculture Project (P159979) 

 

 

  
Mar 22, 2017 Page 21 of 25  

 

mechanism as established in the safeguards documents were not appropriate or applicable to existing local structures. 
The PIU has drafted a new GRM to manage complaints ensuing from the new project.  
 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders outside of government structures are agricultural producers, civil society, private sector (MSMEs 
and SMEs), Indigenous Peoples communities and representatives. Overall, the design of the project has been 
participatory at various levels, through consultation with the different stakeholders throughout preparation. This is 
complemented with additional consultations as part of the review of safeguards instruments.  Representatives of the 
national government formulated the design of the project, while regional governments, local authorities, and 
conservation actors provided inputs. The project will be implemented with the participation of local stakeholders.

B. Introduction and Context 

 
Country Context 

 

1. Rwanda is increasingly recognized as a global exemplar in the pursuit of the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDG) and in meeting the global challenges of climate change. Rwanda’s economy has 
been amongst the fastest growing among the sub-Saharan African (SSA) region. Despite remaining one of 
the poorest on the continent with per capita incomes of US$1,720 (2015, in purchasing power parity 
terms) the economy is nevertheless undergoing rapid structural transformation. Overall Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) growth has averaged 7.6 percent per annum (p.a.) over 2000 – 15, with urbanization rates 
of 7 percent p.a. over the same period. 
 

2. After slowing to 5.1 percent in 2017, real GDP growth is expected to pick up in 2018-19, 
averaging 5.9 percent, and inflation has increased above the National Bank of Rwanda’s (BNR) target 
ceiling of 5 percent.1 BNR has raised interest rates to prevent capital outflow and this will likely force a 
tightening of monetary policy in 2017 – 18. BNR has reduced the repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.5 percent 
to encourage commercial banks to lower lending rates to drive growth in private-sector credit and 
stimulate economic growth.2 Rwanda’s large current account deficit (16 percent of GDP in 2016) has been 
exerting downward pressure on the Rwandan franc (FRw). Higher oil and commodity prices (as well as 
large purchases including new planes for the national carrier) have seen the import bill increase although 
this is expected to be mitigated by recovering commodity prices in tea, coffee and minerals – Rwanda’s 
three main exports. On the fiscal side, the fiscal deficit is expected to narrow from an estimated 4.7 
percent of GDP in 2016/17 to 4.4 percent of GDP in 2018/19, financed by external project-based debt and 
some budgetary loans from development partners and multilateral institutions.3 Notwithstanding these 
emerging domestic and international trends, the overall policy stance of the Government of Rwanda (GoR) 
is likely to remain in line with the existing Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) 
(approved in 2013) and its successor to be finalized and approved in 2018. 

 

3. Rwanda’s Vision 2050 sets an ambitious agenda for further improvements in the standard of 
living, targeting middle-income country (MIC) status by 2020. Parallel targets to reduce food insecurity 
and malnutrition and to further reduce poverty from 45 percent today (according to the national poverty 
line; the headcount rate is 63 percent according to the US$1.25 per day measure) are evidence of a deep 
political commitment to the twin goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity. Except for a period 
between 2000/01 and 2005/06 when the Gini coefficient rose slightly, rapid growth has not been 
associated with an increase in equality. At the same time, the country has embarked on several flagship 
projects to promote a highly skilled service economy, notably around conferences and hospitality and 
information and communication technology (ICT). 

 

4. However, Government spending programs are currently under pressure. The increase in total 
public spending in 2013-2015 has been exclusively for capital expenditures and net lending as recurrent 
expenditures have held steady. The adjustment program of recent years to address growing external 
imbalances restrained the overall fiscal envelope. Health expenditures, for example, have declined both

as a percent of GDP and in terms of their share in the budget in recent years. Going forward, resource 
availability will be further constrained because of a continuing decline in external grant financing. 
Although the headline fiscal deficit will be more expansionary in FY18/19, the decline in grant financing 
will continue to depress the overall fiscal envelope. Going forward, Rwanda’s fiscal spending will remain 
constrained due to the elevated debt and subdued tax revenues.  

 

5. The Government is also concerned by the emerging demographic trends and the rapidly 
expanding ambitions and expectations of new entrants to the labor market. Demographic projections 
suggest that by 2032 rural areas will be home to an additional 2.5 – 3.5 million Rwandans; land is already 
so scarce (50 percent of rural farm households farm less than 0.35ha) that few can be meaningfully 
accommodated in farming. With a working age population projected to increase from 5.2 million (in 2014) 
to 6.6 million – of which 4 million will be youth (14 – 35 years old), realizing labor productivity potential 
and meeting individual aspirations will require off-farm employment opportunities. This need not imply 
urban-based employment. Agriculture and the food system broadly (i.e. non-agriculture sector jobs 
nevertheless part of the food system such as retail, agro-processing, food logistics etc.) can provide 
substantial rural-based non-farm employment (RNFE). Current economic modeling indicates around two-
fifths of the 200,000 new labor market entrants annually could be gainfully employed in this sector.  
 

6. Continued urbanization will present many challenges as well as opportunities including for the 
agricultural sector. By 2050 Rwanda’s population is projected to reach 22 million of which 70 percent 
would reside in urban areas. Assuming similar patterns are observed elsewhere in the region, food 
preferences will change with increasing incomes, with increasing demand for more standardized and 
packaged or processed food and food safety will become increasingly important. This will threaten existing 
supply chains from domestic producers, with likely upward pressure on the food import bill and foreign 
currency reserves. At the same time, tapping into this emerging market can be an important opportunity 
for expanding domestic value chains, diversifying out of food staples and further value addition across the 
agriculture and food system. Meeting these challenges for the domestic market can also serve as a 
launching pad for successfully penetrating regional and international markets. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

7. Notwithstanding, Rwanda’s impressive progress and likely future growth, the country remains 
largely agrarian with agriculture the mainstay of jobs, income and livelihoods for much of the 
population. The sector continues to account for around one-third of GDP. Because of its forward and 
backward linkages, it remains a key driver of overall economic performance and poverty reduction 
(accounting directly for over one-third of the overall reduction in poverty from 59 percent in 2001 to 45 
percent in 2011). 
 

8. Historically, aggregate agricultural performance has been driven by productivity improvements 
and land expansion. Aggregate production of key food staples such as maize, beans, Irish potato, sweet 
potato etc. has increased steadily since the end of the Genocide. According to recent analysis by the 
International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), agriculture’s aggregate growth rate of 5 percent p.a. 
in recent years has been made up of land expansion (2 percentage points) and productivity growth (1.7 
percentage points) with the remainder from increased labor productivity. Rwanda is already among the 
most densely populated countries in SSA and land expansion has been achieved through developing inland 
swamps and valleys with rapidly declining potential for further gains.

9. Despite productivity gains, yields remain below their potential. Crop yields have greatly 
increased since 2000 but yield growth started to plateau as of 2011. (For instance, cereal and cassava 
yields have trebled, sweet potato yields have doubled yet they have made marginal progress in the last 
five years and remain at around 40 – 50 percent of their potential.) Similarly, livestock productivity has 
remained consistently low over time due to lack of good quality animal feed and poor husbandry 
management practices. Diversification into higher value crops has been limited to date, partly because of 
limited farmer knowledge and traditional risk aversion, and also because the public-sector support 
services has been excessively focused on a narrow range of food staples under the Government’s flagship 
Crop Intensification Program (CIP).  

 

10. Farm size is a major challenge.  The average is only 0.6 ha, with perhaps 0.12 ha per worker.  
Production on numerous small plots of land can impose technical inefficiencies related to water control 
and distribution, crop choice and interactions, and planting materials used, while limiting the potential 
for mechanized plowing. The government has made significant progress on land consolidation.  Land 
under consolidated use rose from 28,788 ha in 2007 to 502,916 ha in 2012, primarily through 
consolidation of production rather than of ownership (World Bank, 2014).  The consolidation process has 
not involved mandatory consolidation of ownership, and planting, cultivation and harvesting are still 
carried out by the individual land owners, albeit on a communal schedule (Pritchard, 2013).  

 

11. The agriculture value chains face key constraints at every stage. Research and extension is 
dominated by public institutions which are understaffed. There are insufficient extension services to 
support both quantity and quality, and there are weak linkages between research and extension. Input 
supply systems are driven by the public sector, there is low awareness of the advantages of quality inputs, 
domestic seed production is low and there is limited access to finance. Production potential is restricted 
by land size, subsistence and rain-fed farming, mono-cropping, limited access to irrigation and 
mechanization. Post production is impacted by poor storage techniques and insufficient storage and 
drying infrastructure and safety and quality of produce affected by poor storage and drying. Processing is 
characterized by low capacity utilization. - Less than 10 percent of total production is processed. The 
supply of raw material is irregular and limited. The agricultural workforce has a low level of technical skills. 
Finally, markets are informal and unorganized, Rwanda country branding is weak, and the price-sensitive 
domestic market poses a challenge for start ups to enter the market. 
 

12. The government has focused on extending the rural roads network with a main objective of 
connecting to regional markets and opportunities exists for scaling up regional connectivity. A 
significant proportion of Rwanda’s rural population, whose livelihoods depend on agriculture, lacks access 
to rural transport facilities, including feeder roads. In 2015, only 13,350 km of roads were in good or 
passable condition, but Rwanda targets to have 30,000 km of passable roads by 2028. Poor connectivity 
hampers agricultural development and prevents farmers from increasing access to markets, enhancing 
their competitiveness and improving their incomes and livelihoods. A national feeder roads strategy has 
been developed which establishes the Feeder Roads implementation framework with clear-cutting 
institutional responsibilities for different stakeholders in the Feeder roads sub-sector, promoting labour-
based technology in feeder roads development and outlining mechanisms for funding feeder roads 
development and maintenance.

13.  Rwanda’s proximity to many of the continent’s key food markets and increased global/regional 
consumption for key export crops including bio-fortified staples, presents significant opportunities 
(especially through EAC and COMESA) for enlarged export markets, transport corridors and cross-border 
trade cooperation. Global and regional markets for higher-value agricultural items are also becoming 
more demanding in terms of quality, food safety, and branding, but also more remunerative. Rwanda is 
well-placed to benefit from expanding regional food markets, providing the facilitating investments in 
infrastructure and institutions are in place and the private sector responds. 

 

14. Moreover, existing farming practices are ill-suited to the challenges of climate change, with the 
agriculture sector accounting for 45.6 percent of national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and poorly 
equipped to adapt to changing weather patterns. Climate change projections are highly uncertain, and 
so precise changes to agro-climatic conditions in what is an agro-ecologically diverse country are hard to 
predict. What is certain, however, is that the system is not yet equipped to model, forecast and adapt as 
changes occur and greater evidence becomes available to hone down climate change forecasts. According 
to a recent assessment by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), few climate smart 
agricultural practices are currently deployed. Current on-farm practices are leading to rapid declines in 
soil fertility and land degradation. 
 

15. In addition, Rwanda remains challenged by malnutrition especially among rural households 
with extremely small land holdings, and pervasive food insecurity. The national rate of stunting remains 
high at 38 percent while the latest Comprehensive Food Security and Nutrition Survey (2016) reports that 
around one-fifth of households remain food insecure. The pattern of stunting and food insecurity is 
complex and not only related to food availability – food insecurity is greatest in the western and northern 
areas and stunting is observed even in relatively non-poor areas due to inadequate child care and poor 
sanitation practices, in particular. A narrow focus on a few traditional food staples under the CIP resulted 
in limited dietary diversity, yet there are emerging opportunities with bio-fortification. The Government’s 
existing kitchen garden program is reportedly contributing to broader nutritional intake, although further 
improvements are required. 

 

16. In Rwanda the labor force is growing at a rapid pace annually with census projections showing 
that the working-age population will grow by about 240,000 per year between 2016 and 2025. This 
growth is substantially larger than the increase in jobs during the last 15 years. Acknowledging the 
demographic trends, the ongoing Second Five-Year Economic Development and Poverty Reduction 
Strategy (EDPRS-2) of the Government of Rwanda (GoR) has an ambitious target of creating 200,000 off-
farm jobs annually. For off-farm jobs, both the formal and informal sector will be important. The 
informal non-farm sector absorbed 70 percent of the new workers between 2006 and 2011 and will 
continue to absorb workers who seek a better living outside agriculture. Employment in the formal 
sector, while growing quickly, will remain low for the foreseeable future given it is starting from a low 
base. Even so, the sector remains important since most of the perceived ‘good’ jobs are created by the 
formal private sector. Increases in agriculture productivity and job creation in industries related to 
agriculture (agro-processing, agribusiness) will also support employment outcomes for the most 
vulnerable, unskilled workers. 

 

17. Women perform the bulk of the labor in the agriculture sector, putting in approximately 51 hours 
per week on farm and domestic duties compared to men who work 40 hours. Most women farmers lack

the means to purchase high-quality seeds and proper storage facilities to protect their crops. Many also 
never received education on effective farming methods to increase yields and to ensure that the soil on 
their land remains healthy. This creates a cycle of subsistence farming leaving very little or no profit from 
outputs for farmers to use as a source of income or capital.  

 

18. Despite the observed growth, the non-farm enterprise sector maintains a limited presence. 
Rwanda’s non-farm enterprise sector has been growing from a small base. The number of business 
establishments has increased to 149,404 in 2014 – an increase of 18 percent since 2011 – providing 
employment to 361,901 workers in 2014. However, employment in business establishments represents 
only a small portion of overall employment in Rwanda, with agriculture still being the dominant activity. 
The enterprise sector provided employment to 6.2 percent of working-age Rwandans in 2014 (361,901 
jobs of a labor force of 5,785,000). In addition, there is a limited presence of medium- and large-sized 
private firms and vibrancy in the sector has yet to fully emerge.   

 

19. Considering these trends and projections, Rwanda is committed to identifying and addressing 
the policies, regulations, and investment areas that will stimulate inclusive productivity growth for 
broadening nutritious food production and increasing private sector investment. Furthermore, there is 
commitment across the GoR to pursue new opportunities for farm income diversification to secure further 
reductions in rural poverty, strengthen resilience against the impacts of climate change and to transform 
the dominant subsistence farming sector into a competitive and market-led agriculture sector. Their 
objectives for the food and agriculture system mirror the scale of their broader national goals in terms of 
ambition and conviction to achieve them. 

 

20. To codify these ambitions and articulate a road map to achieve them, the Ministry of Agriculture 
and Animal Resources (MINAGRI) revised and updated their National Agricultural Policy (NAP) in 2017. 
The National Agricultural Policy 2017-2030 responds to the changes facing agriculture and the food system 
nationally, regionally and globally. Under this policy, the role of government in agriculture is envisaged to 
fundamentally shift from making direct interventions in the sector – especially with a focus on production 
only – to a market enabler, thereby promoting enhanced farmer cooperation and private-sector-led 
development of the agri-food economy. The policy seeks to build upon Rwanda’s growing reputation as 
supplier of high-quality, sustainably produced agri-food products, especially for the increasingly 
demanding consumers in Africa’s growing urban centers. It places added emphasis on principles of 
resilience to changes in climate and markets and seeks to seize opportunities offered by advances in 
digitalization and information and communication technology (ICT), and to leverage these also for 
vocational-skill development and for more effective sector administration. The policy also aims to 
promote inclusion through mainstreaming preferential treatment for better participation of women and 
youth in agriculture programs and development. 
 

21. MINAGRI has prepared its fourth Strategic Plan for Agriculture Transformation (PSTA 4) which 
is an articulation of how the Government proposes to implement the updated NAP. PSTA 4 is 
structured around four Priority Areas which are well aligned to the NAP. Priority Area 1: Innovation and 
Extension focuses on improving agronomic knowledge and technology in terms of basic research and 
innovation, development of efficient proximity extension services, as well as promoting knowledge and 
skills of value chain actors; Priority Area 2: Productivity and Resilience focuses on promoting sustainable 
and resilient production systems for crops and animal resources; Priority Area 3: Inclusive markets and

value addition seeks to improve markets and linkages between production and processing; and Priority 
Area 4: Enabling Environment and Responsive Institutions that provides the regulatory framework and 
defines and coordinates public sector involvement. In addition, although women and youth are 
mainstreamed across all priority areas, Priority Area 4 features specific measures and incentives to 
increase gender equity and to introduce skilled youth to commercial farming and jobs along the 
agricultural value chains. PSTA 4 builds on the experience of implementing the previous strategic plan 
(PSTA 3) and provides a basis for ‘future-proofing agriculture to prepare for risks such as those inherent 
in climate change, considering the constraints and opportunities of Rwanda’s demographic, 
geographical and strategic conditions. 
 

22. In addition to MINAGRI, key actors in the sector include the National Agricultural Export 
Development Board (NAEB) and the Rwanda Agriculture Board (RAB). NAEB is responsible for the 
implementation of policies and strategies for promoting and developing agricultural and livestock 
products for export. RAB is an autonomous body largely responsible for research and extension, 
strengthening the linkage with policy, and establish efficiency in service delivery through institutional 
integration in the agricultural sector.  

 

23. PSTA 4 will also be aligned to National Policies and Strategies including Vision 2050, the Third 
Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS III), and relevant sub-sector strategies. 
The EDPRS III was designed to address the Rwanda’s commitment to the SDGs, Intended Nationally 
Determined Contributions (INDC’s) on agriculture, and the Paris Climate Agreement.  The African Union 
has confirmed that PSTA 4 is aligned with goals of Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development 
Program (CAADP) and key regional programs. 

 

24. The proposed Program for Results (PforR) operation will be nested within PSTA 4. PSTA 4 is in 
the final stages of approval – led by a core team within MINAGRI and benefiting from a broad group of 
development partners, including the World Bank and CAADP institutions. PSTA 4 has been endorsed by 
the GoR and will be formally approved at the CAADP Business Meeting on May 15, 2018. Reflecting 
emerging best-practice with PforR operations, the specifics of the PforR Program are drawn from the 
broader PSTA 4 and nested within the Government’s strategy. 

 
PforR Program Scope 

 

25. The responsibility of agriculture public sector institutions, and of MINAGRI in particular, to lead 
the national transformation process outlined in PSTA 4 is clear. The achievement of this transformative 
agenda will require intense policy work with a particular focus on how to promote and support 
agribusiness at all stages of key value chains while balancing commercialization with the consideration of 
poverty reduction and environmental sustainability in a complex, dynamic and risk prone national and 
regional context. The nature of this leadership will be less through the direct delivery of service but will 
be through “thought leadership”, problem solving, policy definition, capacity building, joint enterprise or 
strategic partnership, resource mobilization, regulation, coordination, information management and 
communication. 

 

26. There have been several organizational reviews of agriculture sector institutions as well as review 
and reform exercises intended to inform the transformation of the public sector as a whole.  In addition,

various reports and evaluations, including the 2016 Agriculture Public Expenditure Review and the 2017 
Mid Term Review of the PSTA 3 Strategy have raised significant issues of an institutional nature.  
Furthermore, recent sub sectoral reports or strategies including the Agriculture Finance Diagnostic and 
the National Agribusiness Investment Promotion Strategy (NAIPS) make clear the need for institutional 
reform.  

 

27. The PforR Program has incorporated the recommendations from these reviews and studies into 
its design.  In addition, the design draws on the lessons learned from previous attempts to build capacity 
within MINAGRI, including the first PforR Program. Specifically, the attempts to undertake reforms 
without significant attention to a well design reform process, sustainably addressing Human Resource 
constraints, ensuring communication/coordination are prioritized and ensuring new ways of working are 
well designed and appropriately incentivized.  As a result, the PforR Program makes a sequenced, focused 
and results based approach to the institutional change process central to its design.  

 

28. The scale and complexity of PSTA 4’s institutional reform agenda is significant. However, it will 
take time for MINAGRI to fully establish and strategically apply its “thought leadership” capacity.  Many 
of the expected outcomes will only be fully delivered, at the required scale, during the latter years of PSTA 
4 implementation. In that context, the PforR Program, which supports the first three years of PSTA 4, is 
focused on a series of mutually reinforcing interventions -  some of which are activities, that will deliver 
intermediate outcomes but, more importantly, incentivize organizational reform, create new policy 
instruments, build increased capacity, and establish new systems that will build a sound institutional 
platform to enable MINAGRI to deliver PSTA 4. 
 

29. The proposed PforR operation will support the first three years (2018 – 2021) of the six-year 
strategy of the PSTA 4 (2018-2024). This period of PSTA 4 is focused on establishing a platform for change 
and new ways of working, including the way MINAGRI is structured and reflecting the way it is more 
private sector facing.  

 

30. There is a possibility of supporting the final three years through additional financing, subject and 
without prejudice to normal Bank approval procedures. The activities to be supported under the PforR 
Program correspond to the MINAGRI PSTA 4 agenda. In this context, the focus of the proposed PforR 
operation will be on strengthening the capacity of MINAGRI to increase private sector investment and to 
enable the commercialization of key agriculture value chains in Rwanda’s agriculture sector. Based on 
value chain diagnostics (further elaborated in the technical assessment ANNEX 4) and taking into 
consideration the Bank’s comparative advantage regarding the PSTA 4 Priority areas, the PforR Program 
is constructed around an organizing framework of the following four results areas: 
 

31. Results Area 1: Policy and Organizational Reform – aligned with PSTA 4 Priority Area 4: The PforR 
Program will seek to improve the structure and capability of MINAGRI in order to strengthen sector 
analysis, associated policy reforms and design/introduce relevant financing mechanisms/business models 
for attracting private sector investment. MINAGRI will demonstrate this new capacity by producing a 
Private Sector Leveraging Strategy to guide processes that will leverage private sector financing, while 
ensuring environmental and social standards are maintained. In addition, the foundations for digital data 
systems will be launched to improve management information and enable greater innovation. 
Furthermore, a new mechanism will be established to enable greater interagency coordination (including

key stakeholders such as Ministry of Trade, Financial sector actors, etc.) and communication.   
 

32. Results Area 2: Enabling Agric Commercialization - aligned with PSTA 4 Priority Area 4:  The 
second PforR Results Area focuses on specific interventions to improve the quality of public investments 
in essential value chain services to leverage commercial agriculture. This includes key areas such as 
infrastructure and research, by introducing new business models that will link public investments to 
commercial markets and leverage increased levels private sector investments. PSTA 4 advocates for 
maximizing the effectiveness and efficiency of public investment by leveraging increased private sector 
investment in service provision and delivery/management of agricultural infrastructure. 
 

33. Results Area 3: Delivery of Improved Agric Value Chain Services - aligned with PSTA 4 Priority 
Areas 3 & 4.  The PforR Program will support fostering competitive agricultural value chains, which 
requires the public sector to provide critical services to support production, processing, logistics, 
marketing and the like. This approach is consistent with MFD principles.  The public function supported 
by the PforR Program is to introduce and accelerate the expansion of services that de-risk agricultural 
investments by improving dialogue between private and public actions, increasing the use of private 
sector service delivery (e.g. out-grower schemes and productive partnerships), and expanding access to 
information and financial services. These measures will help achieve a key anticipated outcome from PSTA 
4 and will improve productivity and inclusiveness of agricultural market systems and increase value 
addition and competitiveness of diversified agricultural commodities, for domestic, regional, and 
international markets. 

 

34. Results Area 4: Efficiency in Public Expenditures - aligned with PSTA 4 Priority Area 4. The PforR 
Program seeks to incentivize the dual approach of supporting: (i) a very specific action that demonstrates 
improved efficiency in public expenditure of the core delivery agency RAB; and (ii) a more general effort 
to improve the overall expenditure among the three main agencies that account for the largest share of 
sector expenditure. Since RAB is the agency responsible for key services, improvements in the budget 
execution system will be undertaken with the goal of improving their delivery function. Standards for 
budget execution help to maximize the impact of government spending and the ability to meet such 
standards signals weaknesses that undermines value for money. It also undermines the argument for 
additional public resources since there are associated concerns over malfeasance in execution that render 
MINECOFIN reluctant to allocate additional resources. Previous audits of RAB have not been approved 
because of non-compliance in several important areas. Prior qualified audits have highlighted in detail 
where weaknesses lie and both agencies are aware of where improvements are needed. 

 

35. The implementation of the program will be sequenced.  Specifically, under Result Area 1 MINAGRI 
will develop and seek approval for a Private Sector Leveraging Strategy (with sections on selection criteria 
for private investments, contract governance, and environmental/social management).   Approval of the 
Private Sector Leveraging Strategy will enable MINAGRI to focus on the delivery of Result Areas 2 and 3.  
 

36. The Boundaries of the PforR Program are summarized below in Table 2

37. The Program boundary for PforR financing provides a clear strategic focus to the PforR Program.  
There are areas of PSTA 4 that will not be covered by the PforR Program.  These areas include the 
following: 
 

a. improved soil health and fertility  
b. conservation of biodiversity  
c. skills development 
d. animal resources and production systems  
e. nutrition sensitive agriculture 
f. mechanisms for resilience 
g. quality assurance  
h. knowledge management 

 

38. The rationale for not incorporating these areas in the PforR Program includes the following:  a) 
MINAGRI is in the process of securing both public and external resources for these areas (including 
regional IPF and GASFP), b) these areas are unlikely to provide an equivalent transformation impact and 
c) a number of these areas (e.g. mechanisms for resilience and quality assurance) could not be effectively 
supported by a PforR Program.  

 

39. The PforR Program and its sub-components aim to tackle identified climate risks and 
vulnerabilities as follows: 

• Policy and Organizational Reform. Currently MINAGRI has limited capacity to fulfil its mandate 
in policy development, inter-sector and intra- sector coordination, resource mobilization and 
M&E. The PforR Program will support improving the capability of MINAGRI to properly 
address policy challenges and direct public investments across all GoR. This new capacity will 
result in strengthen regulatory institutions and policies (including rules and regulations) which 
reduce the emissions of GHGs in the agriculture, fishing, livestock, and/or forestry sectors (a 
PAP action), improvements in data management of weather monitoring systems. 

 

• Improved coordination with relevant agencies and actors. The primary focus for the PforR 
Program is to support MINAGRI in becoming a stronger market enabler.  Improving 
interagency working and coordination is a requirement in this process. This improved capacity 
for sectoral collaboration will also be applied toward tackling climate risks and vulnerabilities.

• Commercialization of the delivery of key public goods and services. Most agriculture in 
Rwanda is practiced on steep slopes prone to erosion during the rainy season. While 
considerable progress has been made in constructing robust “bench” (wide) terraces, much 
more needs to be done to secure the land asset.  The PforR Program will support, via the 
efficient use of public funds and leveraged private investments, the restoration and 
conservation of productive landscapes.

Improvements to the collection 

and management of data related 

to land use and livestock will 

improve MINAGRI’s capacity for 

monitoring and early response to 

potential impacts of climate-

crop and livestock pests and 

diseases  

 

DLI 4: Mechanism 

to strengthen 

public private 

dialogue (PPD) and 

specific commodity 

value chain 

platforms designed 

and implemented 

• Two mechanisms designed and budgeted: (1) 
National Public-Private Dialogues (PPD) on 
themes with strategic relevance (2) 
Commodity value chain platforms (year 1) 

• Two national PPDs held and at least 3 VC 
platforms established with operating plans 
(year 2) 

• Additional 2 PPDs held (year 3) 

• VC platforms are fully functional and yielded 
evidence of satisfactory results (as per M&E of 
operating plan) (year 3) 
 

A stronger dialogue between the 

Public and Private Sector 

(including farmer associations 

and other stakeholders) will 

allow for knowledge exchange 

and greater awareness of climate 

risks, and will encourage greater 

consensus and innovation on 

how (exposure to) risks and 

shocks can be reduced and 

managed.

DLI 6: Volume of 

private sector 

investment (in US$) 

matching public 

financing in PPP 

infrastructure 

projects  

The DLI will help to promote new financing 

mechanisms.  Only investments fully committed 

are included in the measure. 

• 4,000,0000 US$ or more (year 2) 

• 7,150,000 US$ or more (year 3) 

Investments will be targeted 

towards infrastructure (e.g. 

greenhouses, drying areas, etc.) 

that is designed to reduced the 

vulnerability of crop storage 

facilities to climate change and 

climate variability. 

 

This investment will also support 

the creation of infrastructure 

that will support improved 

business continuity during and 

after extreme weather events. 

DLI 7: Private 

sector service 

models designed, 

launched and 

achieving positive 

response    

• 6,000 farm households reached by private 
advisory services (non-outgrower scheme) 
(year 2) 

• 8,0000 additional farm households reached by 
private advisory services (non-outgrower-
schemes (year 3) 

• 10,0000 new farm household participating in 
outgrower schemes (Year 3)  

Reduction in the reliance on 

public sector as the key service 

provide will enable MINAGRI to 

refocus resources towards 

supporting farmers who have 

fewer resources to manage 

climate-related risks 

DLI 8: Reform of 

RAB 

• Implementation Plan for RAB Restructuring 

Order prepared and approved by its Board

40. Role of the Development Partners.  MINECOFIN and MINAGRI will be mobilizing resources to 
finance PSTA 4.  There are indications that DFID, EU, IFAD, and USAID will be providing finance via project 
based financing or programmatic financing. 
 
41. DFID is considering providing support for the PforR Program. Once this is confirmed, the most 
appropriate mechanism for their co-financing will be established (i.e., parallel financing, co-financing, 
establishment of a multi-donor trust fund, etc.). To the extent that other development partners (DPs) 
participate in co-financing the PforR Program, it is understood that their funding would need to fit in the 
overall program envelope under PforR financing and would be allocated to the same DLIs, according to a 
similar pattern of distribution (in agreement with the Common Framework of Engagement (CFE)) of the

MDTF, following all existing procedures of the PforR instrument (i.e., DLIs, verification protocols, PAP, 
Program Implementation). 
 
42. DFID, EU, IFAD, USAID, FAO and the Netherlands will continue to provide Technical Assistance 
(TA) to address the recognized capacity gaps within MINAGRI. These DPs are planning to continue TA 
support over the implementation of PSTA 4.  These same DPs are also part of the Agriculture Sector 
Working Group (ASWG), which provides an important forum to coordinate the complementarity of TA 
interventions, also as part of the annual planning and budgetary processes. Discussions are underway to 
explore the most appropriate modalities to be followed by these DPs, including co-financing the PforR 
operation. Having multiple DPs finance the PforR operation would streamline and reduce transaction 
costs for the Ministry by having one mechanism with agreed upon results and a common set of DLIs. It 
would also simplify the financing to support strategic results, whether policies, impacts, outcomes, and/or 
outputs. DPs who wish to provide co-financing under the proposed PforR operation will follow the same 
procedures as the PforR Program. 

 

C. Proposed Program Development Objective(s)  
 

Program Development Objective(s) 
  
To improve the capacity of selected public agricultural institutions and to enable an increase in commercialization of 
agriculture value chains in Rwanda  
 
 
D. Environmental and Social Effects 

 
43. The physical activities planned under this PforR Program follow the scope and nature of 
activities implemented under the previous PforR operation, and moderate adverse environmental and 
social impacts are anticipated to be site-specific and reversible. Identified impacts can be effectively 
mitigated, based on existing environmental and social systems and the solid recent track record of the 
implementing agencies compliance with both national legislation and World Bank safeguards. No 
anticipated Program activities are judged likely to have significant adverse impacts on the environment 
and/ or affected people that are sensitive, diverse, or unprecedented. However, it is recognized that the 
key sector intuitions, such as, MINAGRI and RAB will require significant capacity building to enhance E&S 
systems and staffing to ensure effective implementation and monitoring of not only public sector, but 
also PPP initiatives.  The capacity enhancement efforts for MINAGRI are included in the PforR operation, 
supported by other Donors. Based on the introduction of the new instruments and new types of 
collaboration with the private sector, the overall environmental and social risks of the PforR Program are 
proposed to be rated as Substantial. 
 

44. The previous PforR operation had several notable achievements, such as the development of a 
consolidated Environmental and Social Implementation Manual based on existing government 
guidelines; and national and district level capacity building on the application of the Manual and the 
establishment of a grievance redress call center. 
 

45. The update of the ESSA is still ongoing to incorporate a sample of the private sector entities and

assess the environmental and social systems as they are applied for potential PPP projects, especially 
focusing on Results Area 2: Enabling Agricultural Commercialization and Results Area 3: Delivery of 
Improved Agric Value Chain Services. 
 

46. Environmental Effects. The PforR Program may include small scale irrigation schemes, similar in 
scale to sub-projects under the IDA-financed Rural Sector Support Project (RSSP; phases 1 – 3), located 
in existing sites of agricultural land use, do not involve large-scale resettlement, and consist of land 
husbandry works (e.g., terracing); drainage canals and/ or dams that are not higher than 10m; post-
harvest infrastructure, markets, and community storage facilities. Based on the experience with 
implementation of support to PSTA III, the potential environmental impacts of Program activities are 
generally well known and understood by implementing authorities at the national and local levels. 
Under the previous PforR operation, MINAGRI has adopted an Environmental and Social Management 
System based on the internationally accepted best practices and more specifically, based on 
implementation of other donor-funded projects, including Bank-financed RSSP and the Land Husbandry, 
Water Harvesting and Hillside Irrigation (LWH) project. This system includes national small dam safety 
guidelines, integrated pest management plans, environmental assessments and grievance redress 
mechanisms database. It is expected that the identified environmental impacts can be: (i) avoided 
through a careful site selection process, which entails conducting feasibility studies, an environmental 
impact assessment (EIA), and social screening; and (ii) reduced with diligent monitoring of 
implementation of known and demonstrated mitigation measures. At the same time, the Program will 
have a number of environmental benefits, including (i) a soil conservation and land husbandry program 
that will contribute to more sustainable land and water management and decreased erosion; and (ii) soil 
fertility management, and advance research and seed production, which will improve agricultural 
practices and increase food security in the country. 
 

47. Social Effects. No significant changes in land use or large-scale land acquisition are expected 
from the proposed PforR. The Program continues to pay specific attention to its potential social impacts, 
based on the practices established under previous PforR operation. These include: a chance of moderate 
physical resettlement and/ or land acquisition related to Program interventions and temporary 
displacement due to land husbandry works; challenges of identifying relocation sites due to the limited 
land availability; loss of income from land due to demarcation of buffer zones; potential for limitations 
on access to natural resource use in or around protected areas; consolidation of land use; acquisition of 
land for agro-processing and off-farm activities; benefit sharing of commercial farming if land is rented; 
male capture of community institutions; obstacles for women and youth participation; difficulty of 
purchasing agriculture inputs for the very poor due to their limited access to micro finance; conflict over 
land ownership and use; and weak participatory decision making and lack of transparency. The Program 
is also expected to have significant social benefits for the rural communities in the target areas, such as 
increased productivity and commercialization of agriculture and improved quality and accessibility of 
agricultural services, thus improving citizens’ incomes and overall welfare and quality of life, especially 
for the rural poor and vulnerable. Based on the approach established during implementation of other 
Bank-supported operations, the Program targets farmer groups with specific attention to gender issues, 
including in group and cooperative leadership, inclusion of vulnerable groups, and training in conflict 
resolution and family welfare.  
 

48. Sustainability. Ensuring environmental and social sustainability of Program investments requires

mainstreaming sustainability planning at all levels of the government, including the continuous 
participation of target communities. Currently, the challenge for the sector institutions under the 
Program is to ensure that decentralized decision making, transparency, and accountability are 
institutionalized to enhance sustainability of investments. This need has been recognized by MINAGRI, 
RAB and participating private sector entities and will receive support from the DPs.  
 

49. Capacity. Institutional arrangements for environmental management, including ESIAs, are 
mandated and established at all levels of government. The legal/regulatory procedures and policies for 
expropriation of land in the country adequately respond to the relocation and compensation for loss of 
assets, services, homes, and land. However, a common challenge is the ineffective implementation of 
these requirements and responsibilities due to lack of institutional capacity and financial resources at 
the local level. The assessment of specific capacity of the private sector is ongoing, however, more 
coordination efforts will need to be made by MINAGRI to ensure effective compliance monitoring of the 
PPP interventions. The capacity-building program will continue from the previous phase and focus on 
improving the environmental and social management practices among the government agencies and 
private sector organizations, including in the areas of: (i) implementation and oversight of the 
environmental and social assessment system within the Program; (ii) sustainability aspects of site 
selection and technical designs of the land husbandry and irrigation activities; (iii) documentation of 
involuntary resettlement and project-affected people and vulnerability assessments, including, where 
necessary, preparation of resettlement action plans (RAPs); (iv) screening of potential environmental 
and social impacts and public consultation; (v) enhancing gender-sensitive capacity building of local and 
national staff and service providers and gender responsiveness in agricultural service delivery; and (vi) 
good monitoring practices, including proactive use of grievance redress mechanisms; sampling of soil 
and water quality, and others.  
 

50. OP 7.50 on International Waterways is triggered as the Program activities will involve water 
extraction for irrigation activities from the streams flowing into international basins of the Nile and Lake 
Tanganyika. Following the practice of the RSSP (phases 1-3), the Bank has notified riparian states as part 
of Program preparation. The Bank has assessed, however, that the proposed activities under the 
Program will not result in any adverse impacts to the riparian countries. Irrigation development and land 
husbandry are not expected to have adverse impacts on water quality levels. Even though agricultural 
intensification and increased use of agricultural inputs are objectives of the Program, pre-Program input 
use levels are very low, and modest increases and sustainability measures built into the Program design 
are not expected to have an adverse impact on water quality. In addition, environmental and pest 
management plans are routinely implemented in the Program to mitigate such impacts to minimal 
levels. The PforR Program will not have any adverse effects on the quantity or quality of water flows to 
any other riparian states. 
 

51. Communities and individuals who believe that they are adversely affected as a result of a Bank 
supported PforR operation, as defined by the applicable policy and procedures, may submit complaints 
to the existing program grievance redress mechanism or the WB’s Grievance Redress Service (GRS). The 
GRS ensures that complaints received are promptly reviewed in order to address pertinent concerns. 
Affected communities and individuals may submit their complaint to the WB’s independent Inspection 
Panel which determines whether harm occurred, or could occur, as a result of WB non-compliance with 
its policies and procedures. Complaints may be submitted at any time after concerns have been brought

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 

The intersection of land management, rights, and use forms the key development issue for millions of rural 

Ethiopians facing water insecurity, food insecurity, land tenure insecurity, and livelihood insecurity – all 

amplified by climate variability and change. Climate impacts in Ethiopia are felt primarily through water stress, 

which is affected by land use and degradation that undermines watershed function. In Ethiopia, the estimated 

cost of land degradation is 2-3% of GDP, before accounting for downstream affects, such as increased flood risk.  

The proven remedy centers on delivering a combination of better natural resource management and resource 

rights, jobs and livelihood enhancements, and gender outreach throughout targeted major watersheds. 

Restoration effects include a range of resilience-related results, including increased soil moisture and soil fertility 

important for higher and less variable crop yields, improved water availability, and increased carbon 

sequestration – all of which are high priorities for the government.   

 

Much progress has been made by the government and thousands of local communities to address these challenges 

through proven investment packages financed by the World Bank. However, this work requires more innovation, 

more financing, more coordination, and much greater scale if the country is to meet its resilience and low carbon 

objectives while achieving middle income status in less than 10 years as planned. 
 

 
 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

The World Bank has been financing Ethiopia’s Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MOANR) 

in six regional states to transform the way landscapes are managed by convening sectors, resources and partners 

(IDA, Norway, Canada, Germany, GEF, LDCF) to invest in a holistic and coordinated fashion. With financing 

from IDA through the Second Sustainable Land Management Project (SLMP-2), natural and economic wealth is 

being built on over 1.3 million hectares of degraded communal and smallholder lands through an integrated 

package of activities throughout targeted watersheds that include (i) management of natural resources (soil and 

water conservation structures, agroforestry, participatory forest management, enclosures to reduce free grazing 

and allow assisted natural regeneration, small irrigation, water point development, climate-smart technologies on 

household farmland, and land use planning approaches), (ii) improved land rights through issuance of legal 

landholding certificates to one million people, including landless youth, and (iii) livelihoods support including 

for improved cookstove adoption that reduces women’s labor,  respiratory illnesses, and fuelwood demand.  

 

Results from SLMP-2 financing are well documented in 135 major watersheds in 135 woredas (districts) in the 

six highland regional states during a major drought. Water and food security are boosted. Approximately 9 million 

tons of additional CO2e will have been accumulated in restored productive lands – a proxy for system function 

as well as a contribution to climate change mitigation over 4-5 years. Degraded lands are brought back into 

production for local farmers. Dry season base flow of streams and depth to water table are improving. And, 

protective vegetation cover was either maintained or expanded, as verified by remote sensing. A short video of 

the SLMP-2 approach and achievements is available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nak-

UUZnvPI&t=1s.  Smallholder farmers regularly express how their identity and sense of place has also been 

restored through landscape restoration and improved legal resource rights. Many community members who were

ready to migrate remained in their birthplace. Afterwards, they could send their children to school. They could 

increase nutrition by combining forage and livestock management, produce vegetables and fruits using small-

scale irrigation, and diversify with poultry, apiculture, and woodlot production. Moreover, local people 

established community watershed teams to discuss natural resource problems and opportunities, plan and 

implement interventions on the ground in an empowered, participatory manner.  

 

This transformative approach contributes to key national strategies, including the Growth and Transformation 

Plan-2 (GTP-2), the Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) Strategy, and accompanying 2015 Climate 

Resilience Strategy for Agriculture and Forest, Ethiopia’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), 

the Ethiopia SLM Investment Framework, the emerging National Forest Sector Strategy and National REDD+ 

Strategy, as well as sector strategies for energy, water, and agriculture.  

 

With support from the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience and the BioCarbon Fund, the Bank is further 

supporting the government’s CRGE Facility and four line ministries led by the finance ministry to develop a 

Multi-Sector Investment Plan (MSIP) for climate resilient production landscapes, while taking into account 

relevant activities on water resources, irrigation, and energy. 
 

 
 

Relationship to CPF 
 

The operation features in the Bank’s CPF for FY 17-21 as a government flagship addressing the CPF’s 

resilience pillar, with a funding commitment from IDA-18 for US$100 million. It would leverage and scale up 

support to the MOANR’s proven Sustainable Land Management Program while also contributing to the climate, 

forest, water, energy, and land tenure targets in the client’s GTP-2 and CRGE Strategy as well as the 

forthcoming GTP-3.   
 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 

 
 

To improve livelihoods, climate resilience, carbon storage, and land productivity in vulnerable rural major 

watersheds. 

 

Key Results (From PCN) 
 
10 million hectares restored, supporting at least 20 million people facing increasing food, land tenure and water 

insecurity, and accumulating at least 20 million tons of CO2e per year after restoration.

3a. Biomass in the intervention areas (Tons/Ha)  

4. Land area of the targeted micro watersheds with vegetation increase of at least 4% compared to baseline (Ha) 

 

Bottom 40: Ethiopia’s poorest citizens will benefit from the operation since they are the ones who are dependent on land 

resources for their livelihoods, and are highly vulnerable to climate shocks that good natural resource management and 

improved tenure security can mitigate – as proven in SLMP-2 interventions. 

 

A note on scale: These results imply that 300-1000 major watersheds are targeted, expanding from the current 135 major 

watersheds targeted in the Bank-financed SLMP-2 and just over 100 major watersheds targeted by parallel external 

financing. Interventions in 1000 major watersheds in turn implies an expansion of financing from the current 

approximately $250m for the current SLM Program (Bank and parallel financing together) to approximately $883m in 

total financing, or approximately $800,000 per major watershed depending on the package of interventions selected and 

the amount of blended and parallel financial and technical support provided by partner projects. Bilateral and multi-

lateral co-financiers are interested in significantly leveraging IDA. 

 
 
D. Concept Description 

 
A critical mass of watershed restoration is within reach, but more must be done. MOFEC and MOANR aim to scale up and 

enhance the success of its proven flagship, the Sustainable Land Management Program, for which the Bank has been the 

largest and leading financier. The government has also requested the World Bank to be a GCF delivery partner for large-

scale impact, building on our mutual track record of delivery on the ground, and to convene financing from a variety of 

sources to be truly transformative at very large scale.  

 

The $100m of IDA would be blended with bilateral financing, Green Climate Fund (GCF), Global Environment Facility 

(GEF), plus additional sources of financing currently under discussion, would provide a large and strategic financing 

package to support Ethiopia, through its existing proven Sustainable Land Management Program (SLMP), to reach a 

critical mass of 10 million restored hectares of climate-vulnerable degraded watersheds upon which an estimated 20 

million people directly depend, and which could store an estimated 20 million tons of CO2e per year after restoration.  

An indirect spill over effect of replication would also occur in neighbouring watersheds, as is happening already. Reaching 

this critical mass would be a true transformative achievement, one that has started and built momentum over the years 

but requires institutions, investments, and financing models with a track record of getting to scale -- and with the right 

combination of integrated, well-monitored interventions.  

 

But it is not only about scale. Specific enhancements to the package of interventions are needed to reduce climate risks 

and sustain impact. For example:

• Improved technologies are critical to reduce variability of crop productivity in the face of more extreme and 

frequent droughts, floods, and storms. As part of SLMP’s innovative landscape approach to achieve climate 

resilient productivity, a proven technique in the field ready for scaling is based on use of seeds from Ethiopian 

indigenous land races instead of imported improved varieties. Ethiopian wheat and barley varieties have seen 

approximately 60% yield improvements in the face of drought in actual farmers’ fields. This proven approach of 

deploying Ethiopia’s own genetic crop diversity for drought risk management needs to be brought to more farmers 

in the context of successful models of watershed re-vegetation and restoration and the government’s seed and 

extension system. 

• Information modernization and dissemination: improved meteorological, hydrological, and early warning systems 

are being developed, but the “last mile” of connecting improved weather information with farmers via the 

extension system and mobile phones needs to be strengthened for more timely planning and planting. 

• Small scale irrigation infrastructure is being put in place in restored watersheds and can be enhanced with PV and 

wind water pumps that displace diesel options. Resilient rural roads that also serve as water harvesting structures 

can expand from small pilots to national reach. 

• Innovative measures that integrate land management with land rights can reduce climate risks especially water 

stress. The Bank has financed a proven scheme to provide landholding certificates, inputs, and extension to 

landless youth in exchange for restoring degraded communal land, such as through terracing plus fruit tree or 

plantation outgrower schemes. 15,000 youths have been reached and this could grow to 100,000 in a new 

operation – alleviating urban migration driven partially by risks from land degradation and climate variability. 

• Innovative financing models such as the Bank’s “Performance for Results (P4R)” are proven in Ethiopia’s urban 

space and the selective use of Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) in this IPF could, for example, help incentivize 

rapid, transformative expansion of the issuance of landholding certificates that are important for farmer 

reinvestment in land resource and adaptation. 

• Smart targeting of watershed restoration can expand the lifetime and resilience of key infrastructure including 

reservoirs for hydropower and irrigation. 

• Focusing on generating income streams from value and supply chain development from restored watersheds. An 

example is a large-scale commercial brewery made economically viable because a major restored watershed now 

provides cleaner and more consistently available water in a semi-arid highland setting. Another example is 

cookstoves, which according to a rigorous impact evaluation by the World Bank’s DEC and the Ethiopia 

Development Research Institute, significantly reduces fuelwood demand and deforestation. It also was shown by 

the SLMP-2 community reinvestment clubs to reduce women’s and girls’ fuelwood collection time from 3.5 hours 

to half an hour per day while reducing indoor air pollution, and saving up to 3h of cooking time per session and 

decreased fuel collection time by 1/3. Women also started to produce injera (bread) and sell it to the community. 

• More than 33,000 fuel saving stoves has been distributed or sold to households.  This figure could reach into the 

hundreds of thousands -- and solar lighting could also be included which has very high demand -- if a focused

effort were made to bridge the last mile of distribution via women-managed local enterprise development. A shift 

to ethanol stoves could be prioritized. 

 

In line with the above and underpinned by extensive World Bank analytical work and investment experience on forest, 

climate-smart agriculture, household energy, land tenure, watershed management and landscape restoration, the new 

Resilient Landscapes project financed by IDA, GCF and others would provide large-scale coordinated financial support to 

the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MoANR) and its acclaimed Sustainable Land Management Program to 

make a lasting impact at very large scale.  

 

The Project would be implemented by the government based on sound, proven principles centred on: 

 

• Crowding in activities spatially to comprehensively investment in each targeted major watershed 

• Knowledge disseminated across communities by leveraging a large-scale program, 

• Improving agro-ecological, hydrological and climate information services and extension, 

• Empowered participatory approaches to community watershed management and livelihoods activities,  

• Better land use planning and policy combining bottom-up and top-down approaches informed by a stronger 

evidence base,  

• Mechanisms for deciding on more optimal trade-offs of sector objectives in the landscape,  

• Household energy solutions that impact land use, climate, jobs, women, health and education, 

• Legal land tenure security, and  

• Strengthened government and community institutions to coordinate and deploy investment, information, 

incentives, and income-generating opportunities. 

 

Strategic options for scaling up:  

 

1. Continue toward “full treatment” of existing 135 major watersheds in SLMP-2 and 18 major watersheds 

supported by Canada; 

2. Expand treatments to neighboring major watersheds in existing SLMP woredas, based on degradation/climate 

hotspots; 

3. Expand to neighboring major watersheds in new neighboring woredas, based on degradation/climate hotspots; 

4. Expand to Afar and Somali regional states -- perhaps a handful of western border woredas to pilot, if the 

additional GCF resources or other significant financial resources materialize;  

5. Combination of the above. 

 

Project Components

Ethiopia Resilient Landscapes and Livelihoods Project (P163383) 

 
 

  
May 10, 2017 Page 8 of 16  

     

Component 1. Investment in Green Infrastructure for Resilient Watersheds ($70 million IDA, others TBD).  

This component would scale-up proven sustainable land and water management practices by rural smallholders and 

communities in large watersheds (average 10,000 ha each) vulnerable to climate variability and change, recurrent drought 

and floods, and land degradation. Investment would support communal and individual lands as well as supporting 

infrastructure such as rural roads and small bridges.  Proven climate-smart practices include: soil and water conservation 

infrastructure such as terraces, small irrigation, and water harvesting trenches, check dams, small reservoirs, and other 

civil works; soil fertility and moisture management; assisted natural regeneration, enclosures plus livestock land use 

rationalization, intercropping, low tillage, gully reclamation, establishing grazing corridors, watering points and wells, 

sylvo-pastoral strategies, etc. Government Development Agents in the Bureaus of Agriculture would mobilize and support 

communities and receive continuous training to ensure quality extension. It is also important to enhance the 

interconnectivity of natural resources, which would be supported through land use planning in targeted watersheds where 

green corridors would be established to link fragmented forests, water bodies, key habitats, and rehabilitated micro 

watersheds (km). 

There would be three sub-components: 

Sub-component 1.1. Land restoration and watershed management ($40 million IDA, others TBD).  Described above. 

Sub-component 1.2. Climate-smart agriculture ($20 million IDA, others TBD). Described above. 

Sub-component 1.3. Income Opportunities and Resilient Livelihoods ($10 million IDA, others TBD). This sub-

component would finance advisory services and investment to improve access to and implementation of income 

generating activities.  These activities will help address the issue of landless/jobless youth/women and the 

resulting increased stress on the natural resource base and its potential to reduce climate risks.  Interventions 

could potentially include: 

• Ethanol and improved cookstove and solar home lighting promotion via women-managed local enterprise 

development, to close the last mile in distributing low carbon household technologies that also reduce 

land and water degradation; 

• Support to self-help groups, cooperatives and community unions such as vocational training for jobs, 

identification of business opportunities and preparation of related business plans for natural resource 

based community enterprises or others; 

• Organization of related consultation workshops, private sector forums, exhibitions/fairs;  

• Preparation of marketing strategies and sales promotions, manuals/guidelines;  

• Facilitation of access for technology, market information, credit, standard certification services; 

• Facilitate access to markets and fair trade opportunities; 

• Facilitate opportunities for international foundations and private sector engagement; and 

• Construction of warehouses, stores, product processing and workshops.   

Component 2. Strengthening Institutions and Information: and information modernization (US$ 10 million IDA, others 

TBD). This component would enhance production and management of -- and access to -- relevant environmental, climate, 

hydrological, crop, livestock, forest, geospatial, and weather information for land use decision making and disaster risk 

reduction at the levels of major watersheds, community watersheds, and farms. Land use planning (supported under 

Component 3) would be informed by vulnerability mapping and climate profiling, which would in turn be used to develop

May 10, 2017 Page 9 of 16  

     

or update watershed plans and farm planning (under Component 1) by incorporating climate smart agricultural techniques 

financed under Component 1.  Component 2 would also support rigorous independent impact evaluations through a 

partnership arrangement between the MOANR, the Ethiopia Development Research Institute’s Environment and Climate 

Research Center, the World Bank’s Development Research Group, and the Africa Gender Lab for Impact Evaluation. 

Component 3. Land administration and use (US$ 10 million IDA, others TBD). In the same targeted watersheds in 

component 1, this component would (i) improve the legal land tenure security of rural households and groups through 

land certification and administration, and (ii) expand and enhance local level land use planning and innovations in 

landscape certification models. For the former, approximately 100,000 landless youth would receive legal communal land 

certificates, inputs, and extension in exchange for land restoration. And 2,000,000 households would receive legal 

individual landholding certificates. Half of the communal and individual/HH certificates would include a woman.  For the 

latter, the component would introduce the certification of locally managed forest plantations or natural forest, so that 

forest maturity is reached. This approach to forest management provides job opportunities for establishment and 

management including harvesting, processing and transport of forest products while helping green the supply chain for 

wood products. 

Component 4. Project Management and Monitoring ($10 million IDA, others TBD). The component would finance the 

operational costs of Project Implementation Units (PIUs) in MoANR and Regional State Bureaus of Agriculture. These PIUs 

will carry out all fiduciary aspects of project implementation including financial management, procurement, 

environmental and social safeguards, M&E, sector coordination of investment targeting and policy harmonization, and 

donor coordination structures. 

 
 

 
 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The operation would be implemented in existing 135 major watersheds in the Sustainable Land Management Project II 

(SLMP-2, P133133) and possibly in 18 partially treated major watersheds recently supported by Canada whose funding 
has been exhausted. Additional major watersheds to be targeted will be determined during preparation, and based on 
the scale of financing made available beyond the $100m IDA. Potential new major watersheds could be selected by the 
government based on the following options: (ii) expand treatments to neighbouring major watersheds in existing SLMP 
woredas, based on degradation/climate hotspots; (iii) expand to neighbouring major watersheds in new neighbouring 
woredas, based on degradation/climate hotspots; (iv) expand to Afar and Somali regional states, perhaps a handful of 
western border Woredas to pilot, if significant financial resources materialize beyond ID financing.  
 
SLMP-2 safeguard instruments will be updated taking the above considerations into account as the project concept 

becomes more concrete during preparation, and pending formal site selection by the government and subsequent 
mapping of the specific project intervention area with provision of shape files for each major watershed and community 
watershed targeted for project intervention.

B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
SLMP-2 safeguards implementation was consistently rated moderately satisfactory and to date has not encountered any 

serious problems. RLLP would build upon this implementation structure and the built capacity. RLLP implementation 
would be centered in the MOANR who would be responsible for project implementation down though all levels of the 
government’s existing implementation structure for its Sustainable Land Management Program: Federal, Regional State, 
Zone, Woreda (District), and Kebele (Sub-district). These entities and their staff are generally capacitated and ready to 
implement in the existing 135 SLMP-2 woredas in Oromia, Amhara, SNNP, Tigray, Benishangul Gumuz and Gambella 
regional states. If the proposed new regional states of Afar and Somali and any Woredas additional to SLMP-2 materialize, 
these will require a start-up period of capacity building and mobilization of communities in institutional capacity to 
implement safeguards.  
For RLLP, MoANR will need to update the SLMP-2 Social Assessment through enhanced consultation in existing and 

proposed new areas to integrate the experiences from SLMP-2 implementation and address any new challenges 
identified. This work would then be used to integrate the views, concerns and recommendations into the design of RLLP 
components. If the proposed inclusion of the 18 major watersheds supported earlier by Canada occurs, the MoANR will 
need to conduct Environmental and Social due diligence to identify any gaps and integrate actions in the RLLP design for 
implementation.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

Generally, the RLLP is proposed as a Category B 
project, and would provide positive environmental 
and social benefits by scaling up proven sustainable 
land and water management practices on communal 
and individual lands, coupled with land holding and 
use rights. The EA policy is triggered, given that the 
project would finance supporting infrastructure such 
as rural roads and small bridges, soil and water 
conservation structures such as terraces, small 
irrigation, and water harvesting trenches, check dams, 
small reservoirs, and other civil works; soil fertility and 
moisture management; assisted natural regeneration, 
enclosures plus backyard livestock land use 
rationalization, intercropping, low tillage, gully 
reclamation, watering points ,wells, and also land use 
planning , reforestation and afforestation, etc. The 



 
The World Bank  
Ethiopia Resilient Landscapes and Livelihoods Project (P163383) 

 
 

  
May 10, 2017 Page 11 of 16  

     

RLLP project may have range of activities such as 
construction of small scale irrigation schemes, 
community access road construction, water harvesting 
structures, small or micro-dams, degraded forest 
rehabilitation and reforestation, gully rehabilitation, 
land administration, certification and local land use 
planning. These activities may cause some unforeseen 
environmental and social impacts. These impacts may 
include biodiversity loss, natural habitat and cultural 
resources destruction, soil erosion and sedimentation, 
restriction of access to resources, flooding, involuntary 
loss of land and displacement of people, pollution and 
diseases 
Since the location, scope and nature of the major 
watersheds, micro watersheds, and specific activities 
within these sites are not known at the time of 
preparation, the instrument proposed for analyzing 
potential environmental and social risks is an ESMF. 
Thus, the SLMP-2 ESMF will be updated to capture the 
essence of implementation challenges, concerns and 
views regarding environmental and social risk 
management in the proposed RLLP. Regarding the 
possible inclusion of the 18 major watersheds 
supported earlier by Canada (not involving the Bank), 
an Environmental and Social due diligence will be 
conducted to document environmental and social 
compliance issues and identify recommended actions 
to be integrated in the RLLP design.   

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

Project intervention areas are likely to encompass 
some natural habitats which are protected by law. 
Hence, it is necessary to reflect this OP/BP in the ESMF 
and to ensure that sub-projects are screened against 
this OP/BP and that appropriate preventive or 
mitigation measures are formulated and executed. 
The policy will be triggered because activities in the 
Project may have some impacts on wetlands, 
protected areas, conservation sites, and critical 
ecosystems. Activities involving significant conversion 
of natural habitats or if an environmental assessment 
indicates that a proposed activity would significantly 
convert or degrade natural habitats, the proposed 
activity will not be eligible for financing under RLLP. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

This policy is triggered as the Project areas are likely to 
encompass some forests which may be for production 
or protection. Under RLLP, the forest related activities 
will have positive impacts because of reforestation, 



 
The World Bank  
Ethiopia Resilient Landscapes and Livelihoods Project (P163383) 

 
 

  
May 10, 2017 Page 12 of 16  

     

rehabilitation of degraded forests land and communal 
lands. Community infrastructure such as access roads 
and irrigation schemes may pose some negative 
impacts if forests are found in those sites. 
Management plans with mitigation measures will be 
prepared to avoid or reduce such impacts. If there are 
projects likely to cause significant conversions of 
forests, they will not be financed under RLLP. The 
project ESMF will ensure that subprojects are 
screened against this OP/BP and that appropriate 
preventive or mitigation measures are formulated and 
executed. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The triggering of this OP is predicated on the 
assumption that the Project intends to support the 
introduction of high value crops, new and high yielding 
crop varieties and animal breeds which may lead to 
increased application of agrochemicals (insecticides, 
herbicides, fertilizers, etc.). The ESMF includes a 
description of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) 
approaches that would elaborate on what actions 
need to be undertaken to minimize environmental, 
health and safety impacts. Experience from SLMP-2 
implementation indicates that activities, particularly 
those in agriculture and irrigation (introduction of high 
value crops and use of pesticides, introduction of new 
varieties of crops, new fruit tree species and varieties, 
high yielding varieties) may increase the use of 
agrochemicals (insecticides, herbicides, fertilizers, 
etc...). 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

This policy is triggered given the possibility that there 
may be cultural assets and/or sites in the project area 
and on the assumption that there could be “chance 
finds.”  
The policy is triggered by the Project because the small 
scale infrastructure activities involve access road 
construction, small scale dam construction, and other 
similar infrastructure, which may potentially affect 
physical and cultural resources. The necessary steps of 
public consultations, engagement of cultural or 
religious leaders, local authorities need to be 
conducted before decision on project is made.  

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

As a follow-on operation to SLMP-2, the RLLP is not 
expected to introduce new social risks related with the 
underserved and historically disadvantaged peoples. 
SLMP-2 had conducted an enhanced consultation 
process with project beneficiaries and project affected 



 
The World Bank  
Ethiopia Resilient Landscapes and Livelihoods Project (P163383) 

 
 

  
May 10, 2017 Page 13 of 16  

     

peoples and prepared a Social Assessment in regions 
having the characteristics associated with the 
populations defined under OP4.10 criteria, to seek 
broad support for the project from these groups. The 
findings of the Social Assessment (the identified social 
risks and risk mitigation measures), as well as the 
process used to foster free, prior, and informed 
consultations and achieve broad community support 
have been documented and publicly disclosed.  
The RLLP, as a follow-on operation to SLMP-2, will 
update the Social Assessment and Social Development 
Plan to document experiences and mitigate the 
challenges identified in SLMP-2 implementation and 
ensure the views, concerns and recommendations of 
people in Afar and Somali regional states, if included. 
Regarding the possible inclusion of the 18 major 
watersheds supported earlier by Canada, an 
Environmental and Social due diligence will be 
conducted to document any environmental and social 
compliance issues and identify recommended actions 
to be integrated in to the RLLP design against SLMP-2 
safeguard instruments. The Social Assessment and 
Social Development Plan update will also screen the 
presence of underserved and historically 
disadvantaged peoples in 18 major watersheds 
previously supported by Canada and new areas to be 
covered by RLLP but not previously covered by SLMP 
II.  
The gender and youth dimensions of the SLMP-2 
implementation will be captured in the updated Social 
Assessment and the SDP with a dedicated section to 
ensure provision of adequate implementation and 
monitoring support while addressing the practical and 
strategic needs of the youth and gender aspects of the 
RLLP design.   

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

This OP/BP is triggered based on the assumption that 
the implementation of RLLP interventions may 
potentially involve acquisition of land and/or 
restriction of access to communal natural resources. 
The ESMF, Social Assessment, and the Resettlement 
Policy Framework (RPF) prepared for SLMP-2 will be 
updated based on an enhanced community 
consultation to capture views, concerns and 
recommendations based on experience in 
implementation of the SLMP-2 RPF. Experience from 
SLMP-2 implementation indicates that the scope of

land take has been small and the nature of land take is 
voluntary. The restriction of access to degraded lands 
follow a due process using the participatory watershed 
management guideline. However, to ensure adequate 
assessment satisfactory to the Bank, the RPF update 
will include a participatory process, steps on 
community decision making process including 
identification of appropriate measures to mitigate any 
adverse impacts, if any, on the vulnerable members of 
the community. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

The project triggered OP 4.37 (safety of dams). No 
new construction and/or rehabilitation of large dams 
is anticipated to be financed under the proposed RLLP 
but there will possibly be construction of small dams 
particularly for irrigation of small-farm holdings, these 
may not be large (more than 4.5 meters high) and may 
not require special procedures to follow. In cases of 
small dam construction (less than 4.5 meters), 
implementers can use the FAO ‘Manual on Small Earth 
Dams, a guide to siting, design and construction’. In 
addition, the guideline for small dam construction 
prepared by the MOANR will be used to ensure safety 
of small dams. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 

RLLP woredas are located in international water basins 
such as Abay, Tekeze, Baro or their tributaries. Most of 
the project activities are aimed at better watershed 
and pasture land management, afforestation and 
reforestation, biodiversity conservation as well as 
climate smart agriculture. These activities will 
contribute to reducing soil erosion and rejuvenate 
degraded landscapes hence lesser siltation of rivers 
and streams in the targeted watersheds. None of the 
project activities will therefore adversely change the 
quality or quantity of water flows to the other riparian 
countries. The physical interventions the RLLP project 
is expected to undertake include shallow groundwater 
recharge and micro-scale community-level irrigation. 
While the impact of individual sub-projects would be 
negligible and the cumulative abstractions minor, 
riparian countries will be notified in accordance with 
the policy. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 

1. Kenya’s economic growth has been robust over the past years. For the third consecutive year, economic activity has 
increased, reaching an estimated 5-year high of 5.9 percent in 2016, and once again placing Kenya among the fastest 
growing economies in Sub-Saharan Africa.

1
 Projections indicate continued growth with a rate of around 6 percent in 

2018 and 2019. Kenya’s population is estimated to grow equally fast, with an annual increase of 1 million.
2
 In 2015, the 

country’s population stood at around 46 million.
3
 Natural resources are the basis for livelihood and economic 

development. Agriculture, including forestry and fishery,
4
 represents a major economic driver and a dominant source of 

employment, having accounted for more than 30 percent of GDP in 2015.
5
  

2. The effects of sustained macroeconomic growth are translating into improved quality of life and poverty reduction, 
but inequality remains high. Between 2006 and 2016, poverty measured against the official national poverty line is 
projected to have dropped from 46 percent to 36 percent.

6
 Inequality, however, remains high. Kenya’s Gini coefficient 

stood at 48.5 in 2005.
7 

In remote and sparsely populated areas such as the north-eastern parts or the coastal areas, 
poverty rates can be as high as 80 and 60 percent, respectively. There is a growing rural-urban split, and the richest 10 
percent of the population receive 40 percent of the nation’s income.

 
 

3. In 2008, the Government prepared a long-term development strategy, Vision 2030, which aims to transform Kenya 
into a globally competitive middle-income country by 2030.

8
 The strategy has three pillars: an economic pillar that 

aims to achieve GDP growth of 10 percent per annum; a social and environmental pillar that aims to build a just society 
enjoying equitable social development in a clean and secure environment; and a political pillar that aims to build a 
people-centered, results-oriented, accountable democratic political system. Promoting equal opportunities across the 
entire Kenyan territory is key to realizing this vision.  

4. In an effort to narrow long-term, deeply entrenched regional disparities and to increase the responsiveness of the 
government, Kenya adopted a new Constitution in 2010. County governments now play the primary on-the-ground 
role in delivering services (in the agriculture, water, environment, urban, and health sectors), while the national 
government retains a policy-making, regulatory, and research role.  

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

5. While the fisheries sector contributes less than one percent to GDP, it plays a significant role in employment 
generation, food security, and rural development. Fish production from inland fisheries, marine artisanal fisheries, and 
aquaculture, increased from 150,000 metric tons in 2010, to about 190,000 in 2014, with a market value of more than

 An updated national poverty line and measures will be published in 2017 based on the second Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey 

completed in September 2016. Poverty incidence measured using the international extreme poverty line of US$1.90 per day (2011 PPP terms) was 
33 percent in 2006 and is projected to have dropped to 24 percent in 2016.

US$250 million.
9
 Fish production from marine resources only, amounts to around 9,000 metric tons of catch annually.

10 

Imports and exports of fish products have also been increasing. Fish products were being imported and exported in the 
amount of US$15.5 million and US$39 respectively in 2013, compared to US$4.6 million and US$38.9 million, 
respectively, in 2010.

11
 The sector employs more than 2 million people directly and indirectly, working as fishers, 

traders, processors, suppliers, and merchants of fishing accessories, and thus serves the development and stabilization 
of Kenya’s rural communities, both coastal and riparian.

12
  

6. The artisanal marine fishery is recognized as one of the most important contributors to the food security of coastal 
villages, however, weak governance, particularly an unregulated fishing regime, has led to overexploitation and 
degradation. Fishing effort in Kenya’s marine waters is primarily directed inside territorial waters (i.e., 12 nautical 
miles), is largely artisanal and characterized by small crafts propelled by wind and paddles, and thus almost entirely 
restricted to the fringing reef and near-shore areas. The coastal region is among the least developed in the country, 
with more than 60 percent of the population living below the poverty line, and most relying on coastal and marine 
ecosystems for employment, livelihood and nutrition. On the other hand, Kenya’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), which 
broadly extends 200 nautical miles from the coastline and covers a total area of 142,400 km

2
, is exploited mostly by 

distant-water fishing fleets, comprised mainly of purse-seiners and long-liners.
13 

Unrestricted access to fisheries in near-
shore waters, increased fishing effort driven by a growing population, and destructive fishing gear are destroying 
critical marine habitats and seriously affecting the state of fish stocks. Most nearshore fish stocks are considered fully 
exploited, and in many instances at levels that exceed Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), thereby contributing to 
economic overfishing. The World Bank and the Global Environment Facility (GEF)-financed Kenya Coastal Development 
Project (KCDP) has been supporting the development of Fishery Management Plans (FMPs) as well as stock 
assessments to improve the management of these inshore fisheries. However, the management plans are yet to be 
implemented and used by decision makers and other key stakeholders.  

7. Poor market access and lack of basic infrastructure are causing post-harvest losses, thereby reducing economic 
returns. Lack of appropriate post-harvest fish handling and preservation facilities increase transport time and thus the 
risk of spoilage, ultimately leading to low fish prices or wastage. In 2014, post-harvest losses were estimated at 2,700 
metric tons, representing about 30 percent of total landings for marine fisheries.  

8. The impacts of climate change further compound the challenges coastal communities are facing not only due to 
shoreline erosion, floods, and extreme weather events, but also because of their limited ability to adapt as a result of 
insufficient income and lack of basic infrastructure. In Kenya, 2.8 million people are estimated to live within 25 km of 
the coast, and this number is expected to increase to nearly 4 million by 2030. While the impacts of climate change on 
Kenya’s coast are not yet fully measured, or analyzed, marine and coastal ecosystems are expected to be affected as a 
result of rising ocean temperature, irregular rainfall, sea level rise, ocean acidification, changes in ocean current 
patterns, and more frequent and severe extreme weather events. 

9. With improved management and control, Kenya aims to increase the contribution from offshore fisheries to its 
economic development. Kenya is increasingly engaged in regional initiatives aimed at controlling Illegal, Unreported, 
and Unregulated (IUU) fishing, and in managing regional fishing efforts through its involvement in the IOTC, the 
Southwest Indian Ocean Fisheries Commission (SWIOFC), the African Union-Interafrican Bureau for Animal Resources

 With support from the KCDP, Kenya has recently established an advanced Vessel 
Monitoring System (VMS) in Mombasa, which will become fully operational once licensed vessels deploy the required 
on-board beacons to link with the base station at the State Department of Fisheries and Blue Economy (SDF-BE).  

10. More broadly, and driven by a growing population and the need for sustainable growth in ocean-related economic 
activities, the Government of Kenya (GoK) has made a strong commitment towards improving the management of its 
marine fisheries by embarking on a new approach – the Blue Economy. The blue economy approach aims to increase 
the number of livelihoods and level of income linked to the oceans, while concurrently conserving its resources and 
ecological integrity to ensure sustainability of the coastal/marine fisheries sub-sector.

15
 Sustainable management of 

fisheries stock, enhancing economic returns including through development of local semi-industrial fisheries, and 
improving coastal livelihoods are key focus areas of the GoK. Several State Departments were established through 
Executive Order No.1/2016, with the SDF-BE being tasked with coordinating economic ocean activity, which includes a 
comprehensive mandate to protect marine ecosystems. In addition, a new Fisheries Management and Development 
Act is currently under implementation, and a new national fisheries agency to bolster management of the fisheries 
sector, the Kenya Fisheries Service (KeFS), was established in September 2016. KeFS is in the early stages of becoming 
operational.  

11. The proposed project would support the GoK in implementing its blue economy agenda. MAFIDEV would scale up 
some of the successes of the KCDP. Furthermore, MAFIDEV would support the GoK in the operationalizing the KeFS, 
and help strengthening the marine fisheries and aquaculture-based livelihoods in coastal communities, by building on 
the benefits derived from the Hazina Ya  Maendeleo ya  Pwani (HMP), a coastal development fund providing grant 
support to demand driven community sub-projects which was established under KCDP. 

 
Relationship to CPF 
 

12. The proposed project is aligned with the Kenya Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY2014-2018
16

 as updated during 
the Performance and Learning Review in 2017, whose overarching goal is sustainable reduction in poverty and 
increased shared prosperity. Aligned both with Kenya’s Vision 2030 and its Medium-Term Plan, the CPS highlights three 
priority areas of engagement: (i) competitiveness and sustainability – growth to eradicate poverty; (ii) protection and 
potential – human resource development for shared prosperity; and (iii) building consistency and equity – delivering a 
devolution dividend. The project would directly contribute to the competitiveness and sustainability pillar of the CPS 
through development of a robust marine and coastal fishery economy, thereby addressing the government’s growth 
and poverty reduction strategies. By focusing on the coastal region, the project is expected to contribute to economic 
prosperity, employment, and livelihood of the coastal communities, where deep-rooted poverty and inequality are still 
a major concern for the government.

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  
 

 
 
The Project Development Objective is to improve management and increase value-addition of priority fisheries and 
aquaculture, and to strengthen access to livelihoods for coastal communities in Kenya. 

 
Key Results (From PCN) 

 
13. The key project outcomes are: 

 Index of captured indicator species (size, volume and fishing effort) (tbd) 

 Number of fishing vessels in Exclusive Economic Zone with valid licenses (#)  

 Total production of aquaculture in coastal areas (disaggregated by type of aquaculture) (metric tons) 

 Coastal communities with access to livelihood activities (number) 

 Increase value addition of catch of indicator species (tbd)  

 Share of targeted beneficiaries with rating ‘Satisfied’ or above on project interventions (disaggregated by 
gender)  

 
 
D. Concept Description 

 
14. The project objective will be achieved through targeted interventions grouped under the following proposed 

components. 

1) Component 1 – Governance and Management of Marine Fisheries and Aquatic Resources: Strengthening of 

marine fisheries and aquaculture governance is a critical element to increasing economic benefits from marine 

fisheries. This includes regulating fishing effort to enhance stock productivity and ensuring availability of reliable 

fisheries information for management decision-making. The proposed component would: (i) strengthen marine 

fisheries and coastal aquaculture governance; and (ii) minimize overfishing and destructive fishing practices, 

maintain or improve stock productivity, and enhance the integrity of associated ecosystems. The expected 
outcomes are: (i) improved institutional capacity of KeFS; (ii) improved FIS that supports management decision-

making; (iii) fisheries management measures implemented for four priority nearshore fisheries; (iv) functional (at 

least seven) joint Co-Management Areas (CMAs); (v) effective surveillance of Kenya’s EEZ; (vi) improved 

understanding of the status of stocks and fishing effort in priority fisheries; and (vii) regulatory framework for 

coastal aquaculture in place.  

2) Component 2 – Promote Investment in Marine Fisheries and Coastal Aquaculture: Most of Kenya's marine 

fisheries resources are close to, and in some cases beyond, maximum sustainable harvesting levels. Thus, in the 

context of enhancing overall economic benefits, there are limited options to increasing production sustainably. 

However, there is a greater scope to improve value addition of existing production, in particular through 

improved post-harvest handling, product development and better access to markets, as well as through 

aquaculture development. This potentially creates a space for private sector investment, which in turn will 

generate opportunities for community-level income generation. The objective of this proposed component is to

promote efficient utilization and value-addition of the resources by increasing investment in the marine fisheries 

and aquaculture sector. The component objective will be achieved through facilitating sectoral value chain 

analysis and identifying opportunities for investment in upgrading and/or new processing facilities and marketing 

initiatives, targeting the full range of nearshore resources, industrial offshore tuna fisheries and aquaculture. Such 

facilitation of private sector investment may include enhancing the business-operating environment, potentially 

including relevant infrastructure improvements. The expected outcomes are: (i) improved fisheries-related 

infrastructure; (ii) stable growth in the total economic value generated by sustainable use of the fishery and 

aquaculture resources; and (iii) improved business environment for investments in the fishery and aquaculture 

sector.  

3) Component 3 – Strengthening Marine Fisheries and Aquaculture-based Livelihoods in Coastal Communities: 

Outside Mombasa and tourism centers such as Malindi-Watamu, Diani and Lamu Island, rural coastal 

communities in Kenya remain relatively poor, and would thus be a main target beneficiary group under the 

proposed project. Even the coastal tourism economy is highly vulnerable to fluctuating global economics and 

security challenges in East Africa; therefore, fisheries resources remain the critical livelihood resource for rural 

coastal households in Kenya. Since nearshore capture fisheries resources are already at, or in some cases beyond, 

maximum sustainable harvesting levels, as with private sector development under Component 2, opportunities to 

strengthen coastal households lie more in fisheries value addition, aquaculture production and other enterprise 

development, than in increasing effort on capture fisheries. Accessing these opportunities requires information 

and knowledge sharing, skills development and better access to credit. Strengthening coastal livelihoods is an end 

in itself. However, it also supports a positive feedback loop in terms of strengthening nearshore fisheries 

management. Fishers with more secure livelihoods are better able to engage in fisheries co-management 

initiatives, which, although in the short-term might involve reducing fishing effort and catches, in the medium to 

longer-term allow stock recovery, improved fisheries productivity and further improvements to coastal 

livelihoods. This proposed component would enhance the social and economic benefits that coastal communities 

derive from sustainable use of living marine resources. Expected outcomes are: (i) increased income of coastal 

households from project-supported enterprise development and value-addition initiatives; (ii) increased access to 

and repayment of credit among coastal communities; and (iii) project beneficiaries are distributed by gender and 

age in accordance with stated targets.  

4) Component 4 – Project Management: This proposed component would ensure efficient and effective 

implementation of project activities and fiduciary management. Project management including monitoring and 

evaluation, and safeguards management activities are supported under this component.  

 
 

 
 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The Project investments will be located in the coastal counties of Kenya, including Mombasa, Kwale, Kilifi, Taita Taveta, 

Lamu and Tana River. While the exact location of project interventions is not known at this stage, it is known that Kwale,

Kilifi, Taita Taveta, Lamu and Tana River counties are home to Vulnerable and Marginalized Groups (VMGs) who meet the 
OP 4.10 criteria in terms of their language, culture, attachment to given lands and being subordinate to the more 
dominant communities among whom they live. The livelihood strategies of the VMGs within these counties range from 
nearshore fishing – the closer a community is located to the sea – to subsistence farming, livestock keeping and small 
scale businesses, the farther a community is from the sea. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The overall project implementation would be carried out by a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) in the State Department of 

Fisheries and Blue Economy (SDF-BE), Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries. The SDF-BE has been newly 
established, however, previously it existed as State Department of Fisheries and represented one of the implementing 
agencies of the KCDP. The PCU would hire environmental and social safeguards staff to be responsible for overseeing the 
implementation of safeguards instruments. The initial assessment finds the safeguards capacity of the future PCU to be 
rather limited, therefore a technical assistance, capacity building and monitoring environmental and social risks and their 
mitigation will be included as part of Component 4 design.

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The initial screening revealed that the project is likely 
to have negative environmental and social impacts, 
taking into account that the project activities include 
small and rehabilitation of large infrastructure, such as 
reconstruction of fishing port facilities in Mombasa, 
improvement of landing sites infrastructure, upgrading 
fish markets, small scale fish-handling and processing; 
and product development and packaging facilities. It is 
proposed that the project is assigned EA Category B. 
Given that the nature of the proposed project 
activities, including their design and location are not 
known at this point in time, the project would follow a 
framework approach to managing safeguards. An 
Environmental and Social Management Framework 
would be prepared and publicly disclosed before 
project appraisal. During project preparation, the 
team will identify initial investments ready for 
financing, for which subproject specific ESIAs (and if 
necessary RAPs) will be developed and also disclosed 
prior to project appraisal. Throughout the project 
implementation, each subproject will be screened for

environmental risk and ESIA/ESMP will be prepared by 
the PCU. The preparation of the ESMF and ESIAs will 
be accompanied by a set of public consultations with 
the project stakeholders, which will be documented in 
the assessments. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

Most of the marine coastal area is classified with some 
form of protection, including several national parks. 
Some of the marine protected areas are under 
effective management as they were supported under 
Kenya Coastal Development Project (KCDP).  However, 
others are at various stage of degradation and in need 
for targeted activities to enhance management 
effectiveness including an active monitoring system. 
The project will design its investments to avoid 
negative impacts on environmentally sensitive areas 
and will work with relevant stakeholders, such as 
Kenya Wildlife Service, to enhance the management 
effectiveness of protected areas including the 
establishment of buffer zones and providing capacity 
building to the communities. The ESMF will include 
identification of risks and description of mitigation 
measures specific to avoidance and minimization of 
impacts on natural habitats. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

The Project may include some investments in some 
areas with potential negative impacts on mangroves 
while in other areas may benefits from restoration of 
mangroves. The ESMF will include specific provisions, 
including a TOR for a mangroves management plan, 
for cases where such impact is unavoidable. Project 
preparation will determine the potential impacts on 
mangroves, however the large scale impact is not 
anticipated. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 TBD 
 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 TBD 

It is unlikely that cultural resources will be impacted, 
however, the presence of objects of cultural heritage 
will be identified during screening as part of project 
preparation. The ESMF will include a sample chance 
find procedure to be adopted by the contractors. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

Five of the six coastal counties targeted under the 
proposed MAFIDEV (i.e., Tana River, Lamu, Kilifi, Kwale 
and Taita Taveta) are home to Vulnerable and 
Marginalized Groups (VMGs) who meet the OP 4.10 
criteria in terms of language, culture, attachment to 
given lands and being subordinate to the more 
dominant communities among whom they live, as well 
as other Vulnerable Groups. Under the Kenya Coastal

Development Project (KCDP), a VMG Framework was 
prepared followed by a comprehensive Social 
Assessment (SA), which found that the livelihood 
strategies of the VMGs within these counties ranged 
from nearshore fishing, the closer a community is to 
the sea – to subsistence farming, livestock keeping and 
small scale trades, the farther a community is from the 
sea. The findings of the SA resulted in the 
development of a VMG Plan (VMGP) to mitigate risks, 
which was disclosed in December 2015.  
Activities under Component 1 of the proposed 
MAFIDEV will include regulating fishing effort to 
enhance stock productivity and ensure availability of 
reliable fisheries information for management 
decision-making. While this may result in medium- to 
long-term benefits, in the short term, it might 
negatively affect the livelihood strategies of the fishing 
VMG communities. Since the exact location of project 
interventions is unknown at this point in time and in 
order to continue addressing the livelihood needs, 
strategies and aspirations of the VMGs, the project will 
prepare a VMG Framework. The VMG Framework will 
build on the VMG Framework and SA developed under 
KCDP, accommodate lessons learnt, and be publicly 
disclosed in Kenya and in the World Bank Info Shop. 
Furthermore, the proposed MAFIDEV will build on the 
KCDP best practices and engage the VMGs at all stages 
of the project including at the project design stage.    
 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

Large scale involuntary resettlement and land 
acquisition are not expected to be required for the 
proposed types of investments, as the project expects 
to include rehabilitation of existing infrastructure or 
expansion of existing facilities. While resettlement of 
households can be avoided, in most cases, some 
economic displacement and restriction of access to 
resources is expected to be an impact for the project. 
Since the exact locations of project interventions are 
unknown at this stage, a framework approach would 
be adopted through which the project will develop a 
Resettlement Policy Framework to outline the types of 
compensation required for the project activities and 
guide preparation of the Resettlement Action Plans 
during project implementation. The project will also 
develop a Process Framework (PF) to establish the 
mechanism for compensation, participation, and

implementation of improved management of 
nearshore and offshore fisheries. During project 
preparation, the PCU will identify initial investments 
ready for financing, for which subproject specific RAPs 
will be developed (if necessary) and disclosed prior to 
project appraisal. Throughout the project 
implementation, each subproject will be screened for 
resettlement risks and a RAP prepared by the PCU as 
necessary. The preparation of the RPF, PF and RAPs 
will be accompanied by a set of public consultations 
with the project stakeholders, which will be 
documented in these documents. Particular attention 
will be paid to the identification of vulnerable groups 
among the Project Affected Persons (PAPs), who may 
require special resettlement assistance during project 
implementation. Such PAPs and the nature of their 
vulnerabilities as well as the necessary support to 
them will be clearly documented in the RAP.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 
1. The Republic of Ghana, with a population of about 30.4 million, is classified as lower-middle-income with a per 

capita income of US$5,413 (in 2017 PPP dollars) in 2019. Ghana achieved its current income status through strong, 

sustained economic growth. The country’s per capita income grew by an average of 1.5 percent per year between 1990 

and 1999, by 2.8 percent per year between 2000 and 2009, and by 4.3 percent between 2010 and 2019 (peaking at 11.3 

percent in 2011). Ghana’s economic growth performance during the 2000s is mainly attributed to the sharp increase in 

prices for its main commodity exports, cocoa and gold, and the start of commercial oil and gas production in 2011. 

 
2. The country’s favorable economic growth performance has been accompanied by a substantial reduction in the 

prevalence of poverty. Based on the national food poverty line, the extreme poverty rate fell from 36 percent in 1991/92 

to 16.5 percent in 2005/06 to 8.4 percent in 2012/13, allowing Ghana to meet the United Nations Millennium 

Development Goal of halving poverty by 2015.  

 
3. In 2016/17, measured using the international poverty line of $1.90 per day per person in 2011 PPP dollars, Ghana’s 

poverty rate was 13.6 percent. This level of poverty is substantially lower than the average level for Sub-Saharan Africa. It 

is also lower than the average for lower-middle income countries.1 Measured using the country’s official poverty lines, 

Ghana’s overall poverty rate in 2016/17 was 23.4 percent, whereas its extreme poverty rate was 8.2 percent.   

 
4. Poverty levels appear to differ markedly across areas within Ghana. Poverty levels are substantially higher in rural 

areas than in urban areas. In 2016/17, the overall poverty rate in rural areas was 39.5 percent, five times higher than the 

corresponding rate in urban areas, at 7.8 percent. The extreme poverty was 15.6 percent in rural areas, while it was just 

1 percent in urban areas. Overall and extreme poverty rates in 2016/17 are also markedly higher in the administrative 

regions of Volta, Upper East, Northern, and Upper West than in other parts of the country. These high-poverty regions are 

situated in the northern and eastern parts of Ghana.  

 
5. Spatial patterns in where infrastructure, services, and markets are lacking show strong overlap with the spatial 

pattern in where poverty levels are high, suggesting that these factors may be constraining households from achieving

sufficiently high incomes to escape poverty.2 High-poverty regions also face adverse ecological conditions, which are 

considered to play an important role in constraining growth, development, and poverty reduction.3     

 
6. In recent years, the pace of poverty reduction has slowed, and the association between economic growth and 

poverty reduction has weakened. The COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying global economic crisis also serve as a major 

setback to Ghana’s prospects for further reductions in poverty.  

 
7. In October 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected that Ghana’s real GDP for 2020 will grow by 

0.9 percent.4 In contrast, in October 2019 (before the pandemic), the IMF had forecast real GDP growth of 5.6 percent for 

Ghana in 2020.5 Micro-simulations suggest the pandemic and the Government of Ghana’s measures to control the spread 

of infection (mainly the partial lockdown of Ghana’s largest cities of Accra and Kumasi in April 2020) have contributed to 

large increases in poverty.6 They show that Accra, Kumasi, and other urban areas were hardest hit. They also show losses 

across the population, with larger losses (in percentage terms) for richer than poorer households, and the accrual of large 

losses by farm and nonfarm households in areas that were not locked down, due to interlinkages among markets. 

 
8. A telephone-based national survey of sample households conducted in June 2020 confirms that Ghanaians have 

suffered widespread and acute economic distress amid the pandemic.7 A majority of respondents said they had 

experienced a loss in income since mid-March 2020 when the Government began to introduce restrictions to control the 

local spread of infection. Those who received self-employment income were more likely to report a loss in income than 

those who received wage earnings. Those who received remittance income or other private transfers were more likely to 

report a loss in income than those who received cash or in-kind assistance from the government or nongovernmental 

organizations.  

 
9. In terms of how households were affected by the pandemic, 75–77 percent reported that they were severely 

affected by the suspension of schooling or by an increase in food prices, while 37–44 percent said they were severely 

affected by an increase in the price of nonfood goods and services or by a fall in the price of outputs. In addition, 23–25 

percent reported that they were severely affected by business failure or loss of employment.8,9 Only 1–5 percent of 

households had received any formal assistance, such as from government, NGOs, employers, or insurance.  

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 
10. Over the 2000s, the Government of Ghana, with development partner assistance, has progressively introduced, 

expanded, and strengthened social protection programs targeted at the poor and vulnerable. Ghana’s main social 

protection programs as defined by the National Social Protection Policy (2015) comprise (i) the Livelihood Empowerment

Against Poverty (LEAP) cash transfer program, (ii) the Labor-Intensive Public Works (LIPW) program, (iii) the Ghana School 

Feeding Program (GSFP), (iv) the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), and (v) the Education Capitation Grant.  

 
11. The Government has progressively invested in strengthening the design and delivery of its flagship safety net 

programs. Specifically, the LEAP Cash Transfer program was initiated in 2008 to provide unconditional cash transfers to 

needy households in impoverished areas of the country. The program originally used geographic and categorical targeting 

to identify needy beneficiary households. In recent years, these forms of targeting have been supplemented by proxy 

means test (PMT)-based targeting, applied after categorical targeting. Benefits are distributed every two months, through 

payment points in or near LEAP communities; benefits can also be collected from local branches of partnering financial 

institutions or through ATMs. The program currently reaches 332,000 needy households across the country. The estimated 

program coverage rate ranges from 1.5 to 5 percent of the population based on alternative sources of data (national 

household survey data, government administrative information). The program is highly pro-poor: 74 percent of 

beneficiaries are either extreme or moderate poor. Benefits are currently a function of eligible members in the household. 

Although the Government of Ghana (GoG) has revised the benefits up two times since program inception, benefits remain 

unindexed to price inflation. As such, the average benefit level as a proportion of total consumption of beneficiary 

households was 12.8 percent in 2016/17, lower than the proportions typically observed in cash transfer programs in other 

countries that have been documented to have had sizeable positive impacts on welfare.10 

 
12. In addition, the Labor Intensive Public Works program was initiated in 2011 and offers temporary labor earnings 

opportunities during the agricultural off-season to needy households. In so doing, it also supports the creation, 

rehabilitation, and maintenance of public or community infrastructure. Typical public works activities relate to rural feeder 

and access roads, basic water infrastructure (small earth dams and dugouts), and environmental degradation and climate 

change mitigation activities (reforestation and afforestation, catchment and watershed protection, and biodiversity 

conservation), collectively determined by local officials and communities and consistent with their medium-term 

development plans. Overall responsibility for administering LIPW lies with MLGRD. LIPW is currently targeted at districts 

and communities with the highest poverty levels. Within selected communities, individuals (one per household) self-select 

into the program. At least 60 percent of participants are expected to be women, achieved through community 

sensitization, outreach, conductive work activities, working conditions and hours, and amenities. Participants can work a 

maximum 90 days per year during the agriculture off-season, for up to two consecutive seasons. LIPW wages are pegged 

at the national daily minimum wage, which is adjusted yearly. Private contractors are contracted to manage the works. In 

the current fiscal year, the program has supported 32,300 households in 80 districts, mainly in northern Ghana. Ninety 

percent of LIPW works sites have been in rural communities. 

 
13. More recently, the GoG also piloted a Productive Inclusion (PI) program to enhance the income-generating 

potential of the poor and vulnerable in northern Ghana. It provided training in life, general business management, and 

specific enterprise/livelihood development skills. It also provided business capital grants amounting to the cedi equivalent 

of US$200 (provided in tranches after beneficiaries completed the full set of training). The pilot PI program reached 7,200 

beneficiaries, compared to an original target of 3,150 beneficiaries; 80 percent of beneficiaries were women, compared 

to an original target of 50 percent. Important lessons learned from the pilot included the need for a well-designed and -

implemented digital program MIS, greater information and facilitation for beneficiaries to access productive inputs and

output markets, and further capacity building of actors at the district and community levels engaged in implementation. 

A tracer study of PI program beneficiaries under GSOP is currently underway.   

 
14. The GoG’s commitment to Social Protection is further evidenced in the establishment of the Ministry of Gender, 

Children, and Social Protection (MoGCSP) in 2013, with the mandate to coordinate social protection programming. In 

2015, a National Social Protection Policy was approved by the Government, which sets the vision and guides efforts in the 

sector, including increased financing and harmonization of programs and increased coordination across key ministries 

involved in the social protection sector, namely MOGCSP, the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development 

(MLGRD), Ministry of Education, and the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) and across different government 

administrative levels (national, regional, and district). 

 

15. The Government has also introduced several system-level reforms and innovations to strengthen program 

delivery performance. Central among them is the continued rollout of the Ghana National Household Registry (GNHR), a 

national social registry; use of digital benefit payment systems; the use of digital program management information 

systems (MIS’s) covering the full program delivery chain; and the rollout of an integrated unified citizen engagement and 

grievance redress system, called the Single Window Citizen Engagement Service (SWCES). These reforms and innovations 

have improved program implementation performance, including transparency and integrity.  

 
16. These program and system-level improvements have been supported by various World Bank projects. Specifically, 

the $139 million Ghana Social Opportunities Project or GSOP (P115247), which was implemented between 2010–18, 

supported the Government in administering and strengthening LEAP, LIPW, and the pilot Productive Inclusion program. 

GSOP was rated by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) as either satisfactory or substantial across all dimensions 

examined.11 The Ghana Productive Safety Net Project (GPSNP - P164603), which is currently under implementation by the 

Government, is a $60 million IPF operation that builds on GSOP. GPSNP became effective in July 2019 and supports the 

Government to strengthen its social safety net system toward improving the welfare and productivity of the poor. GPSNP 

is also supported by the United Kingdom Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (UK FCDO) through a 

Recipient- and Bank-Executed Trust Fund of £21 million.12 The project’s support has been coordinated with that of other 

development partners, including the European Union (EU), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), and the United 

States Agency for International Development (USAID). The project comprises of five main components: (i) Productive 

Inclusion, (ii) LEAP Cash Transfers, (iii) LIPW program, (iv) SP Systems Strengthening, and (v) Project Management.  

 
17. These IDA-financed projects have contributed to strengthening the design and implementation of the LEAP 

program and its underlying system, including the capacity of the MoGCSP, the MLGRD, and other government and private 

actors involved in implementation. Recent such initiatives have included the development and implementation of a digital 

LEAP MIS, PMT formula and PMT-based targeting, and digital payments.13 Under LIPW, improvements have included a 

digital program MIS; digital wage payments; capacity development of district officials, private contractors, and community 

facilitators; and information, communication, and engagement (ICE) activities, including grievance redressal. The projects 

have covered the full program costs of works contracts and beneficiary wages.

18. In addition, the PI program is currently being scaled up in northern Ghana under the GPSNP, incorporating 

measures to improve program implementation based on lessons learned from GSOP. The program targets some of the 

poorest districts and rural communities. Within these communities, LEAP and LIPW households receive preferential 

treatment for PI participation. Under GPSNP, the PI program aims to reach a total of 18,000 beneficiaries; at present, 

8,000 beneficiaries are receiving training and are expected to receive the first tranches of their capital grants shortly. As 

under the pilot, most beneficiaries are women, driven by a combination of endogenous household decision-making 

regarding which members work where and conducive program rules and procedures.  The PI program supports both farm 

and nonfarm income-generating activities; the former is supported through links to the World Bank’s Ghana Commercial 

Agriculture Project (P162525). Behavioral interventions to support improved financial decision-making of PI beneficiaries 

and their households are also being tested with the assistance of ideas42, an international nonprofit consulting firm 

focused on behavioral program design. The welfare effects of the PI intervention are being evaluated by the World Bank 

based on a randomized phase-in design.  

 

19. Systems Strengthening was also supported through these projects. Specifically, the GNHR was established to 

improve targeting for social protection programs and other poverty alleviation initiatives in Ghana. Launched in 2015 

under GSOP, GNHR completed data collection for two out of the three targeted regions. Under GSOP, GNHR completed 

data collection for the Upper East and Upper West Regions, the poorest regions in Ghana. Subsequently, through GPSNP, 

GNHR completed data collection for 400,000 households in October 2020 in three Northern Regions,14 and currently 

preparing to begin data collection in two additional regions – Volta and Central. GSOP and GPSNP were both instrumental 

in developing a fully functional management information system to track enumeration activities, including the use of 

geographical information systems. The GNHR system was also used to collect emergency data during the COVID-19 

pandemic when data was required to identify poor and vulnerable people within the lockdown areas who needed support. 

 
20. The Government initiated the SWCES in 2017 to streamline grievance redress mechanisms for social protection 

beneficiaries, but also to address other vulnerabilities handled by the MoGCSP. The SWCES includes (i) a toll-free hotline 

which receives calls from across the country, with agents responding between 8am and 5pm on weekdays, and a voice 

mail system after hours and on weekends; and (ii) a digitized referral directory, which is continuously updated. During the 

COVID-19 pandemic in Ghana, the call center was instrumental in receiving grievances from vulnerable individuals who 

required food aid during the lock down period.  A total of 1,315 out of 1,978 cases were from individuals who required 

aid. 

 
21. GPSNP has also supported the Government in developing and implementing an information, communication, and 

engagement strategy in relation to the pandemic for social safety net beneficiaries and communities and implementing 

health protective measures in the program delivery chain to protect personnel, beneficiaries, and communities from 

COVID-19 infection, including measures to comply with infection mitigation directives by the Government. 

 
22. GPSNP was restructured in August 2020 to intensify the Government’s social safety net response to the pandemic. 

Specifically, funds have been reallocated within the project to allow for previous and planned emergency cash transfers 

to existing LEAP program beneficiaries and to new beneficiary groups. The reallocation also allowed for, among other 

things, accelerated, intensive efforts under GNHR and SWCES. To date, the project has disbursed $40 million, and expects 

to exhaust its financing by March 2022.  

 
14 Ghana’s administrative system had 10 regions during GSOP implementation but expanded to 16 at the onset of GPSNP. As such GNHR will have 

to reach all 16 regions of Ghana, instead of the previous 10.

23. The Government has requested GPSNP 2 toward the following ends: 

 

• Scale up PI, LIPW, and LEAP to cover more households that are poor, vulnerable, or hard-hit by the COVID-induced 
economic crisis in both rural and urban areas; 

• Strengthen the social protection program delivery infrastructure, including the completion of GNHR; 

• Continue the further integration of ICT solutions into the program delivery chain, including monitoring; and 

• Integrate structures and processes that improve the shock-resilience and -responsiveness of the social protection 
system. 

24. These directions consistent with the priorities and directions of the Government’s overall COVID response. They 

are also consistent with the aims and directions in the World Bank’s Board documents WBG COVID-19 Crisis Response 

Approach Paper – Saving Lives, Scaling-up Impact and Getting Back on Track and Protecting the Poor and Vulnerable: 

Social Response Framework for COVID19.  

 
Relationship to CPF 

 
25. The World Bank’s Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) for Ghana, published in 2018, identifies four pathways 

toward the achievement of the World Bank’s twin goals of eliminating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity in 

Ghana. These pathways comprise (i) addressing inequality and vulnerability, (ii) improving macroeconomic management 

and economic diversification, (iii) increasing better-quality jobs and opportunities, and (iv) strengthening governance and 

government effectiveness.15 Consistent with this SCD, the World Bank’s Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Ghana, 

currently under preparation, identifies three focus areas: (i) improving equitable access to services for improved human 

capital development, (ii) enhancing conditions for diversified growth and job creation, and (iii) promoting resilient 

development. Under these focus areas, specific objectives have been formulated.  

 
26. The proposed efforts under GPSNP 2 to strengthen and expand cash transfers, productive inclusion (cash grants; 

business and life skill training; savings support; access to inputs, services, and markets), labor-intensive public works 

(involving rehabilitation of water resources infrastructure, forestation, and conservation), and health insurance to needy 

households are consistent with the objectives of all three CPF focus areas. Specifically, the project’s proposed efforts are 

in accordance with the following CPF objectives: (i) improved utilization of health services for the poor and vulnerable 

(objective 1.2), (ii) improved connectivity for access to markets and productive opportunities (objective 2.1), (iii) increased 

financial inclusion and access to financial services (objective 2.3), (iv) enhanced market relevant skills and income 

opportunities (objective 2.4), (v) improved adoption of sustainable natural resource management (objective 3.2), and (vi) 

improved household preparedness for shocks (objective 3.3).  

 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
To support the Government to expand and enhance social safety nets that improve the incomes and productivity of 
the poor

Key Results (From PCN) 
 

1. Number of households that receive the full set of support through the Productive Inclusion (PI) program and start 
a new, or enhance an existing, income-generating activity  

2. Number of households that participate in the Labor-Intensive Public Works (LIPW) program 
3. Number of households that receive cash benefits from the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) 

program 
4. Number of social protection programs that use data from the Ghana National Household Registry (GNHR) to 

target benefits and services to intended beneficiaries 
 
 
D. Concept Description 

 
27. The proposed GPSNP 2 will be an IPF of $100 million, spanning four years. It is composed of six components (with 

tentative allocations) as follows:  

• Component 1: Productive Inclusion program (US$15 million) 

• Component 2: Labor-Intensive Public Works program (US$25 million) 

• Component 3: Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty program (US$25 million) 

• Component 4: Social Protection System Strengthening (US$28 million) 

• Component 5: Project Management, Coordination, and Capacity Building (US$7 million) 

• Component 6: Contingency Emergency Response (US$0 million) 

 
28. Components 1-3 represent the main interventions supported by GPSNP 2. Components 4 and 5 underpin the main 

interventions by supporting social protection system functioning and improvement. Important initiatives such as GNHR, 

SEWES, and the extension of health insurance coverage are reflected under the system-related components, as are, more 

generally, monitoring and evaluation; information, communication, engagement, and grievance redressal; capacity 

development across implementing ministries and administrative levels (national, region, district, and community); and 

reforms to the system to enhance shock resilience and responsiveness. Component 6 offers built-in flexibility to the project 

to rapidly reallocate financing to support needed relief and recovery initiatives for the poor and vulnerable in the event 

of a future disaster or crisis that affects the country.         

Project Beneficiaries 
29. The interventions under GPSNP 2 aim to protect and raise the welfare of poor and vulnerable households across 

Ghana. Reaching the poor and vulnerable will follow, in part, from targeting interventions to the poorest communities, in 

both rural and urban areas. Direct beneficiaries of some of the programs (for example, LIPW and PI) will be at the individual 

level. The digital MIS’s for the various programs, GNHR, and sample-based field surveys by contracted third parties will 

provide beneficiary information at both the household and individual levels, allowing for breakdowns of beneficiary 

numbers by different socioeconomic and demographic characteristics (for example, location, gender, age, disability status, 

welfare status).  

 
30. Over the project implementation period, GPSNP 2 will support the Government to reach the following cumulative 

beneficiary numbers: (i) 45,000 households under PI, (ii) 45,000 households under LIPW, and (iii) 400,000 households 

under LEAP. GPSNP 2 will also support the extension of NHIS coverage and facilitation services to access and use health 

services to PI, LIPW, and LEAP beneficiary populations.

Summary of Screening of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts 
.  

 
The Environmental Risk Rating is moderate. The environmental risks and impacts expected from the LIPW subprojects, such 
as rehabilitation and maintenance of small earth dams, dugouts, and rural feeder and access roads; cultivation of fruit trees 
and tree crops as part of the climatic change initiatives and provision of water, household toilets and community solid waste 
collection services will present low to moderate environment risks. The potential risks and impacts are, however, specific 
and may include erosion, siltation, flooding, dust generation, road safety hazards, waterborne diseases, generation and 
disposal of spoils and waste, and health and safety issues. Cultivation of fruit trees and crops may require the use agro-
chemicals. These expected risks and impacts are envisaged to be low to medium in magnitude, temporary, site-specific and 
largely reversible.  
 
The Social Risk Rating is moderate. This classification is based on the potential social risks and impacts and the capacity of 
the implementing agencies to manage the risks and impacts. The project builds on experiences and lessons from the 
ongoing GPSNP (P164603) and successor project GSOP (P115247) and seeks to improve productivity, social inclusion, 
expanding income earning opportunities to poor households, and providing relief to extremely poor households due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic.  
 
While the project activities are expected to have positive impacts, some social risks and impacts are envisaged. The 
proposed project activities are small-scale; however, the activities that may generate social risks include the proposed 
rehabilitation and maintenance of rural feeder and access roads and small earth dams and dugouts; construction of of 
WASH facilities and provision of cash grants and cash transfers to extremely poor households. Other social risks and impacts 
envisaged include project ability to manage local labour issues and localized economic displacement arising from land use; 
addressing community health and safety issues, ensuring social inclusion and preventing elite capture of project 
interventions; and putting in place robust framework for Stakeholder engagement and addressing grievances and SEA/SH 
prevention.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 

1. Niger is a large, landlocked country in the arid and semi-arid Sahel region. The country’s 
population is estimated at over 22 million, half of it less than 15 years old and growing rapidly at about 
3.9 percent per year.. Two-thirds of the country is inhospitable desert, and more than 84 percent of the 
population is concentrated in the areas along the Niger River in the southwestern part of the country 
and along its long southern border with Nigeria. The climate is mostly arid; annual rainfall in 85 percent 
of the country’s area is less than 350 mm.  However, some areas in the south and along the Niger river 
get some 600 mm of rain, making rainfed agriculture with dryland crops possible. 
  
2. Niger’s political institutions have been strengthened since the restoration of constitutional 
order in 2011. The Government of Niger (GoN) is pursuing important measures to combat organized 
crime and terrorism and to promote the safety and property rights of its citizens. Military and law 
enforcement agencies have created new crisis response units, and border security has been 
strengthened in close collaboration with regional and international partners. As a result, both unrest in 
various zones of Niger and insecurity in the border zone with Mali have diminished. Nevertheless, the 
country continues to face significant risks related to domestic and regional instability, as well as 
organized crime and transnational terrorism. The rise of Boko Haram in Nigeria and the recent expansion 
of its operations to neighboring countries, including Niger, is cause for concern.  Further, there are now 
over 100,000 refugees from Nigeria in the Diffa region.   

 
3. Niger is a founding member of the Sahel Alliance, an organization that committed its members 
and development partners to combine their efforts and better coordinate their actions to create the 
conditions for sustainable growth and lasting peace.  It aims to achieve more effective aid coordination 
and enhance the support from development partners to the region, in order to more generally 
contribute to stabilizing the security situation and eradicating poverty, by developing solutions for rural 
areas, creating employment for young people, improving energy infrastructure and the fight against 
climate change, and strengthening governance. 

 
4. Since 2000 Niger has had a good track record for macroeconomic stability. It has embarked with 
some success on reforms to foster private sector-led economic growth, reduce its debt, and improve 
social indicators. Niger has significant mineral wealth, including uranium and gold, and has started 
exporting refined oil products. These three commodities account for approximately 70 percent of the

NIGER - AGRICULTURAL AND LIVESTOCK TRANSFORMATION PROJECT (P164509) 

 
 

  
Mar 04, 2018 Page 4 of 18  

     

country’s exports. However, despite improvements, Niger continues to face persistent, long-term 
development challenges linked to its large geographical size, home to a largely rural population often 
beyond the reaches of public services, where the bulk of the poor reside. 

 
5. Although poverty incidence is declining, Niger remains among the poorest countries in Africa, 
with an estimated average per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in current prices of US$420 in 2014, 
well below the average GDP of US$1,600 for Sub-Saharan Africa (IMF, 2017).  In the 2016 Human 
Development Index, Niger was ranked second to last out of 188 countries.  Despite a decline in overall 
poverty incidence, the rural poor became poorer relative to their urban counterparts during the 2005-
14 period. Their per capita consumption relative to that of the urban poor declined from 60 percent to 
43 percent. Lack of economic diversification, volatile agricultural growth, low access to physical and 
institutional infrastructure, and weak human capital base limits economic opportunities, especially in 
rural area. 

 
6. Food insecurity and malnutrition remain a challenge. Overall, growth of major food production 
was slightly less than the population growth over the period 1980-2011, with the increase in the food 
deficit being filled by imports. Malnutrition is a big challenge with. An estimated 2.5 million people in 
Niger are chronically food-insecure and unable to meet their basic food requirements even during years 
of average agricultural production. During periods of constrained access to food, millions more can 
quickly fall into acute transitory food insecurity. Over the past years, Niger made some progress on 
nutrition indicators, but the country still lags substantially behind other low-income countries and Sub-
Saharan African counterparts. Malnutrition accounts for more than one-third of child mortality in the 
country and 43 percent of children under five years old suffers from stunting and wasting. Malnutrition 
remains high due to a host of health, sanitation, and behavioral factors, worsened by recurrent food 
shortages.    

 
7. Niger is vulnerable to climate shocks, with drought being the most important risk in terms of 
frequency and impacts. A strong correlation exists between changes in gross domestic product (GDP) 
and the meteorological conditions, demonstrating the fragility of the economy to weather-related 
events, particularly in the agriculture sector.1 The food crisis resulting from the 2011 drought affected 
almost half of the country’s population. While uncertainty remains regarding longer-term climate change 
projections (2050-2100), short- and medium-term rainfall deficits will most likely continue to plague 
Niger’s agriculture sector, and the frequency and severity of droughts may remain the same or increase. 
The agriculture, forestry, and other land uses (AFOLU) sector accounts for 89 percent of total greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions, while the energy sector accounts for 9 percent. The national priority for the AFOLU 
sector in Niger’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) relates to improving the resilience 
of the agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry subsectors. For Niger, the adaptation options 
considered as top priority are those that will permit higher co-benefits with respect to climate change 
mitigation, particularly those good adaptation practices and techniques that will permit carbon 
sequestration and reduction of GHG emissions while improving productivity. Niger’s climate change 
strategy is based on the vision of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) and access to modern energy services 
for everyone in 2030.    

 

                                            
1 The 2013 World Bank agriculture sector risk assessment report indicated that Niger’s GDP growth rate dipped into 
negative territory eight times between 1984 and 2010, and drought was largely responsible.

8. Women and young people are marginalized. The main factors that significantly impede the 
economic empowerment of rural women in the agricultural sector include: difficulties in accessing 
natural and productive resources, the overwork of rural women as they are in charge of both productive 
and reproductive/ household tasks, lack of women's leadership and decision-making, and limited access 
to information and education/ training.  Similarly, rural youth are mostly un-educated and lack 
professional qualifications. Their low social status and the difficulties they encounter to access economic 
opportunities limit their participation in decision-making at community and family level. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

9. Agriculture (crops, livestock, and fisheries) is very important for the economy and employment. 
It represents more than 40 percent of the national GDP and occupies nearly 90 percent of the active 
population. The performance of the sector is unstable from one year to another because of its high 
exposure to agronomic, climatic, health, and more recently security risks.  The shocks that follow 
agricultural and livestock crises have a strong impact on household incomes,  the general budget  of the 
State and the growth rate at the overall Nigerien economy.  
 

10. Crop subsector.  Crop production is only possible in the relatively humid areas in the south-west 
of the country (an area of some 12 million hectares; about 10 percent of the national territory). 
Additionally, there are some 19 million hectares mainly pasture lands. Most crops are produced under 
rainfed conditions with low yields, including millet, sorghum, and other cereals (including coarse/feed 
grains), as well as legumes (cowpeas, groundnuts) in more modest amounts. The remainder of crop 
production grown by irrigated conditions, including rice and vegetables.  The yields of irrigated crops, 
however, are still below potential. The average size of a family farm unit is about 5 hectares, producing 
mostly for household consumption and little marketable surplus.  The production of food/feed grains, of 
which by-products are used for animal feeding (e.g. shredded millet/corn stalks) as extensive livestock 
production, is common to each farm and remains the customary production model. Agricultural 
productivity remains low largely because of a highly variable agro-climate from year to year with a 
constrained access to inputs such as certified seeds and fertilizers.  More entrepreneurial farmers are 
facing a weak financial market, limiting access to credit, and suffering from poor access to quality 
phytosanitary products, limited familiarity with modern production practices, and the difficulty of 
accessing urban markets due to lack of aggregation, and a lack of adequate transport infrastructure and 
transport means.  
 

11. Livestock subsector. It is a key sector of the Nigerien economy that contributes 13 percent to the 
national GDP and provides 7 percent of the country's export earnings. The national herd is estimated at 
more than 10 million cattle, 24 million small ruminants, and a little over a million and a half camels.2 
Three main types of livestock farming co-exist in Niger: (i) the "pastoral systems" characterized by animal 
mobility (extensive breeding systems for camels, small ruminants, and cattle), (ii) the traditional livestock 
farming systems practiced by villagers throughout the country, for ruminants and poultry, and (iii) 

                                            
2 Despite the mortality associated with successive pastoral crises, livestock numbers have been steadily increasing 
over the past ten years, rising from 11.5 TLUs in 2005 to 14.5 TLUs in 2012. [Tropical Livestock Units/Unités de bétail 
tropical (TLUs/UBT); a TLU implies a live weight of 250 kg]. The most significant increase involved cattle (+ 38 
percent) and goats (+ 22 percent). Equines and camels had the lowest rates of increase (4 and 7 percent, 
respectively). While the increase represents a larger potential food reserve, these animals also need to be fed in 
what is often a fodder-constrained environment. 



 
The World Bank  
NIGER - AGRICULTURAL AND LIVESTOCK TRANSFORMATION PROJECT (P164509)

"improved livestock systems" (mainly semi-intensive and intensive peri-urban poultry and ruminant 
fattening). Other types of farming (quite marginal, but diversified) include beekeeping, rabbit breeding, 
etc. 
 

12. Fisheries subsector. National consumption of fish is only in the order of about 2 kg per inhabitant 
per year, implying a total demand of about 44,000 tons per year.  Production between 2012 and 2017 
fluctuated within a range of 27,000 to 47,000 tons.  Most of the catches from Lake Chad are exported to 
Nigeria (in smoked form).  Some fish are imported fresh or frozen from Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Benin, and 
Côte d'Ivoire.  Potential for import substitution exists. There are currently about 70,000 people employed 
in this subsector, involving fishermen, processors, and traders, and the estimated contribution to GDP is 
about 0.7 percent. Previous projects financed by other donors have demonstrated that there can be 
relatively high fish productivity in ponds (more than 200 kg/ha/year in many ponds particularly for 
catfish, Carp, and Lake Chad perch).  Also, there exist some successful local initiatives for community 
management of fisheries. Fish output could be increased, including particularly with an expansion of 
aquaculture, while conserving fishery resources and the natural resources on which these are based.  Key 
actions would include investments in water management, particularly of excess water during the rainy 
season (continuing investments or similar to some of those under PRODEX) along with improved 
extension and transfer of technology.  
 
13. Extension and advisory services, support to processing and marketing, and availability of 
financing are weak. These constrain agriculture development.  Some of the factors explaining the weak 
status of extension are: weak human resources, limited research along with limited research and 
extension linkages, unclear extension messages, limited specialized services to support crop quality, 
animal health, and food safety; limited transport resources and operational budgets to visit farmers and 
their fields/livestock, and low use of information and communication technology (ICT). The above factors 
combine to limit effective coverage of crop and livestock extension to support production.  Similarly, 
bottlenecks in the various value chains limit support to value addition on production, such as with 
processing or packaging units of products of animal and vegetable origin, and the weakness of the inter-
professions.  However, opportunities exist as proven by private or professional initiatives regarding milk, 
dried meat, hides and skins, cowpeas, onions, sesame, nut-grass, etc. Finally, financing for the sector is 
lacking. Banks are reluctant to take risks to finance the agriculture and livestock operations, and micro-
finance institutions are weak. 
 

14. Significant water resources exist but are insufficiently used. The limited use of water is a major 
constraint for crop production.  It is estimated that only 1 percent of surface runoff and 15 percent of 
renewable groundwater are currently used, and that less than 30 percent of potentially irrigable land is 
currently irrigated.  Water resources consist of large surface water networks as well as large renewable 
groundwater reserves of around 2.5 billion m3, and 2,000 billion m3 of non-renewable water reserves. 
This water potential is underutilized. Only the Niger River flows permanently throughout the year, while 
five other large rivers feeding the Niger river flow only part of the year. There are also about a thousand 
ponds, including 175 permanent ones that are mostly used by livestock herders for watering their cattle.  

 
15. Other constraints for agriculture development include: (i) institutional, legislative and regulatory 
deficiencies (means and capacity of intervention of the State services, including some of its laboratories 
for analysis and diagnosis, unsuitable texts and/or not-applied data and unused monitoring/evaluation 
systems); (ii) low level of organization of sector actors (POs, unstructured IPs and other cooperatives

without economic organization capacity); (iii) lack of technical and economic benchmarks on the 
intensification of farming and livestock systems; (iv) difficult access to advisory support (low coverage 
and weak messages of the extension network and local veterinary services) and quality production inputs 
(low access to improved seeds, livestock/poultry feed capacity limited and uncontrolled); (v) low genetic 
potential of the most common plant varieties and animal breeds or under-valued potential; (vi) 
inadequate investment and support for the sector (lack of industrial-scale infrastructure and outdated 
equipment for production, processing, storage, transport and marketing, low value of by-products); (vii) 
overexploitation and non-sustainable use of land resources; (viii) limited decentralization and land 
insecurity; and (ix) national system for preventing and managing crises (of climatic, sanitary, and 
commercial origin) that is not well adapted or developed.  

 
16. Main assets of the agriculture sector. These include: (i) a substantial potential for irrigated 
farming, (ii) the presence of a numerically large and diversified herd with untapped potential for 
increased productivity through animal health, feed, genetic improvements, and better husbandry 
practices; (iii) the presence of plant varieties and animal breeds recognized for their adaptive and 
productive potential in their agro-climatic environment; (iv) traditional know-how and good experience 
of producers in certain areas (flood recession cultivation, livestock fattening, artisanal milk production, 
poultry); (v) competitiveness of certain export sectors (onions, cattle/meat); and (vi) important sectoral 
contribution to the fight against poverty (the main source of household income), and to food and 
nutrition security. 

 
 

Relationship to CPF 
 

17. The proposed project is fully aligned with the Niger Country Partnership Framework (CPF) and 
the Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD). The proposed project is aligned with the CPF and SCD as it 
would contribute to poverty alleviation and improved food security through increased farm productivity 
and value addition in selected agricultural value chains, thus improving rural livelihoods. It would 
generate employment in general and in particular for women and young people in the targeted areas. 
The SCD underlines that “improving the productivity in agriculture remains a first priority for poverty 
reduction.”  The CPF has an overarching goal of empowering women, while engaging with men as allies, 
to bring down the unsustainable population growth rate in Niger and to enable development policies to 
succeed. In the medium term, reduced demographic pressures are expected to free up scarce public 
resources to fund services, such as health and education and enable further empowerment of women 
and girls in a self-sustaining virtuous circle. Within this overarching logic, the FY18-21 CPF, approved by 
the Board on April 10th, 2018, focuses on the importance of boosting agricultural productivity, 
diversifying exports, and raising incomes in the rural sector where 80 percent of the population live. 
Investments in the agricultural sector, including livestock and fisheries, are therefore essential, such as 
through the proposed project. Specifically, yields can and should be increased, including, for example, 
via use of more productive varieties, small-scale irrigation, agroforestry and intercropping, which the 
project would emphasize, while increasing the involvement of youth and women.  
 
18. The proposed project is also aligned with the Government’s sector strategy in support of 
agriculture and livestock.  The strategy is described in the Plan for Economic and Social Development II 
(PDES II), focused on "food security and sustainable agricultural development," implemented in 
particular through the 3N (“Nigeriens feed Nigeriens") Initiative. The Initiative aims to contribute to the

overall overarching goal of eradicating hunger, while helping to improve the productivity and income of 
farming households, especially the most vulnerable. The approach is also intended to operationalize the 
Rural Transformation Program of the Sustainable Development and Inclusive Growth Strategy (SDDIC). 
It contributes to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted in 2015 by the 
United Nations World Assembly, including SDGs 2 and 1. The general orientation of the proposed project 
is also in line with the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Plan (CAADP), the ECOWAS 
Common Agricultural Policy (ECOWAP), and the Agricultural Policy of Africa (PAU; UEMOA). 

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  
 

19. The Development Objective (PDO) is “to increase productivity and commercialization for selected 
agriculture and livestock value chains and strengthen the country’s capacity to respond to eligible crisis 
or emergency”. This objective is fully aligned with the Government's vision for agricultural and livestock 
development. 

 
Key Results (From PCN) 

 
20. Key performance indicators include: (i) increased productivity of project-targeted agriculture and 
livestock systems: this would be measured based on area irrigated and increased yields (kg per hectare 
or per head), including the reduction of losses due to the most prevalent animal diseases; (ii) incremental 
sales in targeted value chains, including for dairy/milk, cattle/meat, fish, poultry, onions, and niébé 
(aggregated over all the targeted value chains); and (iii) reduction in the Government’s response time to 
agriculture and livestock sector-related emergencies including sanitary crises. In addition, the following 
two core indicators regarding direct beneficiaries would be measured: (i) number of small-scale 
agriculture producers and sedentary livestock rearing and fish farming households benefiting from 
project interventions in the project-targeted production basins, particularly the vulnerable groups (e.g., 
women and youths); and (ii) beneficiary satisfaction rate with the quality of project-supported services, 
as a partial measure of citizens’ engagement in the Project. The detailed results framework would be 
developed during the course of preparation. Adequate provision would be made in terms of human and 
financial resources for the design of thorough M&E activities as part of project preparation. A baseline 
survey would be conducted to inform indicators regarding the reference situation at project inception. 
 

D. Concept Description 
 

21. The World Bank's Agriculture and Livestock Portfolio in Niger currently includes the following 
projects: (i) Export Promotion Project (PRODEX) which ended in October 2017 and for which an 
Implementation Completion Report is currently being  prepared; (ii) Additional Financing for the West 
Africa Agricultural Productivity Project, approved in 2017; (iii) Regional Support Project to the Sahel 
Irrigation Initiative/Project d’Appui Regional à l’Initiative pour l’irrigation au Sahel (SIIP/PARIIS) approved 
in December 2017; (iv) Climate-Smart Agriculture Project/Projet d’Appui à l’Agriculture Sensible aux 
risques Climatiques (CSA/PASEC) approved in 2016; (v) Sahel Regional Pastoral Support Project (PRAPS-
Niger) in operation since fiscal year 2016 to support pastoral livestock production; (vi) Phase 3 of the 
Community Action Program/Programme d’Actions Communautaires (CAP3/PAC3), with its recently 
approved additional funding in 2017 and scheduled to close  in December 2019; (vii) the Regional Disease 
Surveillance Systems Enhancement Project (REDISSE) is strengthening the national cross-sectoral 
capacity for disease surveillance and epidemic preparedness,;  (viii) a rural development policy operation

being disbursed over 2017-2018 under IDA 18. This project will provide financial support for the 
implementation of the PDES II whose  objectives include “increasing rural productivity growth” and 
“supporting growth enabling sectors.” It has numerous actions planned, including in energy, mineral 
exploitation, financial sector, etc.; it also seeks to provide input subsidies and improve agricultural 
extension in pilot communes; and (ix) The Competitive and Growth Support Project, which is closing on 
March 31, 2019 and  includes the rehabilitation and upgrading of slaughterhouses and their respective 
environments for developing meat production. In spite of the above projects/investments, there still 
remains a significant gap in terms of the overall performance of the agriculture and livestock sectors.  
 
22. Scope of intervention and complementarity with other projects. The PIMELAN would capitalize 
on the lessons learnt and best practices by past and on-going Bank projects. The targeted production 
systems and activities would be complementary to those supported by other Bank-financed projects. On 
the crop production side, the project would focus on increasing irrigated production with a focus on 
onions, and horticulture production (tomatoes in particular); it would also focus on fodder production as 
a link to the livestock production. It would capitalize on the results of the Small Irrigation Project (SMP; 
closed in FY 2009) and PRODEX (closed in October 2017, which already built on SMP) as well as PASEC 
that focuses on climate-smart agriculture (CSA) and PARIIS that focuses on irrigation. Regarding livestock, 
the project would focus on sedentary livestock systems to enhance cattle and small ruminant production 
and meat processing, the milk and poultry value chains (meat and eggs), and fish farming and processing; 
it would complement PRAPS-Niger which focuses on pastoral systems. The PIMELAN would deal with 
value chains in an integrated manner; it would focus on processing and marketing activities downstream 
of production. It would also address as a major thrust the financing constraints of the sector through TA 
support to partner financial institutions (PFIs) and funding for matching grants to producers and other 
V/C participants, following mechanisms already used by other projects. It would also coordinate with IFC 
and complement on-going or planned IFC work on agri-business development. 

 
23. The proposed Project would be structured as an Investment Project Financing (IPF), funded by 
an IDA credit in the amount of US$100 million over a six-year period. The Project would have three 
interrelated components: (i) improving the quality of public and private services in support of agriculture 
and livestock; (ii) support to public and private investments for improved production, processing, and 
market access for selected agriculture and livestock value chains; and (iii) crisis prevention & 
management, and project coordination. The project would be complementary to the ongoing agriculture 
and livestock projects. 
 

24. Integrated value chain approach. The rationale for the proposed project is to boost productivity 
in the selected agriculture and livestock value chains (V/Cs). The selected V/Cs would be: (i) Crop 
production: irrigated onions and vegetables; and (ii) Animal production: cattle and small ruminant meat, 
cows, poultry, goat and camel milk, hides and skins, as well as fish farming. This project would adopt an 
integrated value chain approach for the selected V/Cs from production to marketing on the domestic 
and regional markets or export to international markets. It would support financing through small credits 
or grants for services and activities of entrepreneurs who are ready to engage in intensification of their 
production, development of value-added activities to primary production through diversification of 
processing activities, and the logistics between agricultural production and the market (including 
processing, storage, and transport). This would require the close involvement of Partner financial 
institutions.

NIGER - AGRICULTURAL AND LIVESTOCK TRANSFORMATION PROJECT (P164509) 

 
 

  
Mar 04, 2018 Page 10 of 18  

     

25. The project would address cross-cutting priorities.  The main cross-cutting priorities proposed to 
be addressed under the project are: (i) capacity-building of extension and advisory support for crop and 
animal production; of input supply services (including seeds, feed supplements, and genetics); and of 
veterinary services; (ii) land restoration and sustainable land management; (iii) empowerment of women 
and youth; (iv) climate change mitigation and adaptation; (v) public health and nutrition; and (vi) 
environmental and social safeguards. 
 
26. Preparatory activities. Before making a final choice of actions to be selected, preparation work 
would identify the difficulties and constraints to be considered to guarantee the success of the project 
through a detailed mapping of the sectors and locations already covered by other IDA projects and those 
of other partners. The authorities would determine whether the priority actions should relate to sectors 
and/or locations not supported so far, or the promotion and scaling up of sectors already supported and 
promising in terms of supply of the domestic and export market. Due to the diversity of beneficiaries, 
and therefore the needs that would ultimately be identified (in terms of production sectors but also of 
typology of actors), a selective approach would be preferred, with a preferential focus on women and 
young people (see below). 

 
27. There have been recent developments in the Agriculture Sector in Niger, such as the reform of 
agriculture extension services and facilitation of the policy environment for investing in the sector.  On 
August 2, 2017, three important decrees were issued. These created: (a) the National System of 
Agricultural Extension/Système National de Conseil Agricole (NSAE/SNCA); (b) the Promotion Agency for 
Agricultural Extension/l’Agence de Promotion du Conseil Agricole (PAAC/APCA); and (c) the Investment 
Fund for Food Security and Nutrition/Fonds d’Investissement pour la Sécurité Alimentaire et 
Nutritionnelle (IFFSN/FISAN). A Committee has been set up to help with the operationalization of these 
bodies and to develop a roadmap, including the preparation of procedural manuals, the recruitment of 
the DGs and the technical directorates, etc.  PIMELAN would provide support to make them fully 
operational and effective. 

 
28. The preliminary project description is presented below.  
 

Component 1: Improving the quality of services in support of agriculture and livestock--US$ 25 million  
 

29. The objective of this Component would be to increase the productivity of agriculture and 
sedentary livestock farming systems for selected crops and non-pastoral value chains (milk, meat, fish, 
poultry, onions, and niébé) through the strengthening of the capacity and efficiency of services which 
would provide more and effective support and advice to producers. In doing so, it would build sustainable 
human, institutional, and policy capacity for key public and private actors in the agriculture and livestock 
(including aquaculture) sectors, in order to improve crop and animal husbandry practices (and therefore 
output), including climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices, as well as improved access and delivery of 
quality extension services (crop production, animal health, feed, and breeding), which would also help 
farmers to strengthen their resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards.  Activities would 
include:  
 

(a) Support to crop and livestock extension and advisory services in order to increase 
producers' knowledge and capacities to facilitate increased productivity. Knowledge 
developed under the West Africa Agricultural Productivity Programme (WAAP) would 



 
The World Bank  
NIGER - AGRICULTURAL AND LIVESTOCK TRANSFORMATION PROJECT (P164509) 

 
 

  
Mar 04, 2018 Page 11 of 18  

     

be disseminated to help reduce crop and livestock losses and contribute to improved 
public health; and involvement of extension services would help in finding synergies 
and complementarities with PRAPS-Niger, PASEC, and the SIIP. Support would include 
knowledge development for the selected crop and livestock value chains through 
increased transfer of Good Agriculture Practices (GAPs) by rolling out innovative 
extension models, such as livestock Farmer Field Schools (FFSs) and e-extension, 
diffusion of innovative technologies (including CSA, such as climate-resilient feed 
production and mitigation options), developing technical references, and providing the 
related training; provision of improved access to quality agricultural and zootechnical 
inputs (fertilizers, seeds, phytosanitary and sanitary products, food, genetics). 
Improved extension services are expected to increase producers’ awareness about 
climate change and improve their capacity to mainstream climate action; 

 
(b) Productivity and food safety enhancement via provision of specialized services to 

support crop quality, animal health, and food safety. The aim would be to increase the 
availability of and access to high-quality services and inputs for crop and livestock 
producers (including aquaculture). It would include crop and animal disease 
surveillance in order to improve the quality and hygiene of food of plant and animal 
origins, strengthening programs of animal prophylaxis (animal health/vaccinations) 
and fight against major pests and diseases, including prevention and management, 
weather monitoring, veterinary services enhancements and vaccination campaigns, 
quality control of crop and animal products, and seed and input certification.3 It would 
seek synergies and complementarities with PRAPS and REDISSE. Pest and animal 
health surveillance, together with weather monitoring, is expected to improve herd 
and crop resilience to climate-induced risks; and 

 
(c) Strengthening the policy planning and regulatory framework. This activity would aim 

at strengthening MoA&L’s efficiency and effectiveness by supporting policy 
formulation and developing the attendant legislation/regulations for improving the 
agriculture, livestock, and fisheries regulatory environment, and reducing distortions.  
This would include supporting the preparation of sector master plans, public 
investment plans, public expenditure reviews, support the establishment of 
agricultural and livestock infrastructures (establishment of service platforms at the 
level of the eight regions, according to approaches adapted to the target sectors, 
which would also include CSA options), and definition of food standards (quality and 
safety).  In order to support women’s empowerment and enhance agricultural 
productivity, the project would support policy development to expand women’s land 
rights and formally document their land claims to improve land access and tenure 
security for women.4 

                                            
3 This could involve the development of registers for plant and livestock varieties to help standardize food 
production and processing methods.  A livestock identification and registration system would help with disease 
mitigation and management from getting a handle on animal movements within the country.  It might be useful also 
to develop a phyto register to catalogue locally-developed seeds but also help with controls of invasive species (bugs 
and weeds). 
4  These proposed actions are fully in line with World Bank Policy Research Working Paper No.7199 by Prospere 
Backiny-Yetna and Kevin McGee, entitled: “Gender Differentials and Agricultural Productivity in Niger.” The paper

Component 2: Support to public and private investments for improved production, processing, and 
market access for selected agriculture and livestock value chains—US$ 60 million  

 
30. The Component would promote public and private investment at all levels of the selected value 
chains of milk, red meat, fish, poultry, onions, and niébé (production, processing, storage, transport, and 
marketing) for the development of production, market access, and competitiveness. The objective would 
be to increase productivity (while adapting to climate change and allowing for reduction in GHG 
emissions) and to strengthen the competitiveness of the targeted sectors (including through processed 
product diversification) and facilitate market access for producers and breeders, and agro-industry. 
These activities would be aimed at supporting the intensification and modernization of cropping and 
sedentary livestock systems, as well as processing units in the selected value chains, with a view to 
reaching operators' critical sizes to increase profitability and generate jobs.  

31. The intervention principles would be the following: (i) supporting the enhancement of capacities 
of farmer, cooperative, and inter-professional organizations in the targeted sectors in order to allow the 
emergence of an improved, more competitive economic fabric; (ii) identifying pre-investment activities 
(commercial viability studies, capacity building of service providers) to prepare viable business plans for 
economic operators and improve access for project promoters to financing by partner financial 
institutions (PFI); (iii) improving market access by removing distortions and supporting aggregation and 
packaging/processing points for agricultural and livestock products; and (iv) financing public and private 
investments in all segments of the sectors targeted by the project (production, processing, upstream, 
and downstream) within the framework of Productive Partnerships, i.e. economic partnerships between 
producers and other operators of the value chains. 

 
32. Activities envisaged to strengthen value chains (VCs) could be as follows: strengthen the 
economic organization of operators (support for professional structures); facilitate the linking of supply 
and demand (structuring of supply, identification of markets, linking, and contracting prospects); conduct 
pre-investment and training activities for economic operators and private service providers, in order to 
identify viable business plans, and improve operators' access to PFI financing (development of financial 
products for livestock farming, training of PFIs in the agriculture and livestock sector, negotiation of 
agreements with PFIs to partially finance project promoters); and finance investment subprojects within 
the framework of Productive Partnerships in all segments of the targeted sectors (upstream, production, 
downstream) in the form of cost-shared grants that could finance inputs, services, training, equipment, 
and infrastructure. 

 
33. Possible windows for investment funding. Funding and co-financing of investments in the 
targeted VCs would likely be conducted through separate windows, such as: (i) Productive Partnership 
(PP) window: for larger investment sub-projects, requiring individual contributions in cash and PFI 
funding; these sub-projects could involve, inter alia, scaling up of small-scale irrigation with the use of 
solar energy instead of diesel pumps; (ii) medium-scale microproject (MP) window: for medium 
investments with combination of cash, PFI funding, and in-kind contributions; and (iii) small-scale 
microproject (MP) window: for small investments with in-kind contributions and no external funding 

                                            
explicitly recommended enhancing women’s tenure rights in order to improve agricultural productivity. It further 
recommended facilitating women’s access to and use of hired farm labor and facilitating its supervision, incl. by 
facilitating community-based child care.

requirements. Under these three windows, women and youth would receive preferential treatment.  The 
most appropriate financing modalities, including lower and upper thresholds for different windows, 
would be determined during project preparation. 

 
34. Women and Youth. Possible types of investments, favoring women and youth where feasible, 
may include: (i) promotion of small-scale irrigation facilities and equipment in order to properly manage 
water for agriculture purposes. This would be done according to the National Small-Scale Irrigation 
Strategy developed (SPIN) in Niger. The activities to be carried may also include structures to 
manage/store excess water during rainy season; (ii) land tenure rights recognition/documentation in 
order to preserve existing assets and use rights and to avoid conflicts; (iii) land reclamation, upgrading of 
soil fertility and improving existing carbon pools (such as through rangeland management, agro-forestry, 
reduced tillage techniques, etc.); (iv) development of storage facilities (including cold chain and adapted 
to climate risks); and (v) marketing structures. 

 
Component 3: Crisis prevention & management, and project coordination--US$ 15 million  

 
35. The objective of this component is to develop mechanisms for preventing and responding to 
severe crises and emergencies in the agriculture and livestock sectors, including future extreme weather 
events and other climate risks, as well as to strengthen project coordination capacities within MoA&L. 
Accordingly, its proposed activities relate to: (i) crisis prevention and management, and (ii) institutional 
support and project management: 

(a) Crisis prevention and management: (i) support MoA&L’s capacity to deal with crises by 
providing equipment (computer hardware and software, office furniture, vehicles, etc.), 
training and resources for specialized studies and communication campaigns, and vaccines; 
(ii) develop and operationalize crisis prevention and management tools, including the 
organization of forums for crisis management at local and national levels (as well as 
participation in international crisis management forums in West Africa and the Sahel); and 
(iii) funding of an Contingency Emergency Response Component (CERC). In doing so, the 
project would help establish a Crisis Management Unit at MoA&L with the capacity to 
intervene quickly when needed through the provision of emergency funds for severe crises 
and institutional support.  
 

(b) Project coordination. This activity would support all PCU activities required to manage IDA 
funds, procure IDA-funded goods and services, conduct project M&E including Iterative 
Beneficiary Monitoring (IBM),5 and comply with safeguard mitigation measures.  It would 
provide training and equipment to modernize MoA&L operations (computer hardware and 
software, office furniture, vehicles, and so on) at the central level and in the field as needed 
for project activities. It would also support general awareness and sensitization campaigns 
about project activities.  

    

                                            
5 This activity would monitor beneficiaries of the project starting at the beginning of the implementation with the 
objective to improve project efficiency and increase beneficiary satisfaction and beneficiary engagement. IBM collects 
information on project implementation, even in insecure settings. It is light, low-cost, and rapidly complements 
project supervision. The approach is problem-oriented and provides feedback to project teams through different 
iterations with the aim of catalyzing improvements in project implementation. IBM collects data directly from 
beneficiaries but keeps data collection efforts to a minimum by relying on few research questions and small samples.

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The Project will be nationwide. However, during preparation it will be determined whether the focus will be on selected 

Communes in the eight regions, depending on the selection of value chains and the complementarity with other ongoing 
projects. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (Recipient) has considerable experience in implementing IDA-funded 

Agricultural sector development projects. This collaboration with the Bank has obviously provided the Ministry with some 
technical capacity with regards to the application of World Bank environmental and social safeguards policies; the 
development of appropriate safeguards mitigation instruments and their implementation and monitoring.  Staff of the 
Ministry have shown a great deal of understanding and implementing social and environmental safeguards measures on 
the ground. More recently, the Recipient successfully carried out the CAP3 microprojects in accordance with the WB 
environmental and social safeguard policies and the national environmental and social compliance requirements. This 
good standing trend will be continued and further mainstreamed as the Recipient will continue to receive guidance from 
the Bank’s Environmental and Social Safeguards Specialists in the project team through supervision missions and virtual 
support to the Social and Environmental Focal Point.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The proposed project is categorized as B under this OP 
policy because its potential social and environmental 
risks are expected to be moderate and mostly site-
specific, with no significant or long-term negative risks 
and impacts. The potential environmental and social 
risks and impacts are mostly related to the use of 
fertilizers, pesticides and the increased GHG emissions 
due to the land-use change during agriculture cycles.   
Since the project physical footprint is presently 
unknown prior to appraisal, and in compliance with 
OP/BP 4.01 core requirements, the Borrower will 
prepare an Environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF), consult upon and disclose it prior 
to appraisal.  The ESMF will be mostly building upon 
the existing PAC3 ESMF to guide the way that 
potential negative environmental and social risks and 



 
The World Bank  
NIGER - AGRICULTURAL AND LIVESTOCK TRANSFORMATION PROJECT (P164509) 

 
 

  
Mar 04, 2018 Page 15 of 18  

     

impacts of future sub-projects (following the positive 
list) will be identified and mitigated during project 
implementation. The ESMF will include social and 
environmental clauses to be observed by the farmers 
and herders, especially during project implementation, 
by which time most project activities footprints will be 
known.  If, during project preparation, any specific site 
is known before appraisal, Environmental and Social 
Impact Assessments (ESIA)/Environmental and Social 
Management Plans (ESMP) will be also be prepared 
and publicly disclosed, both in-country and at the WB 
prior to appraisal. 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No  

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 No 
The policy is not triggered as the project will not 
support activities in areas where critical habitats may 
be threatened. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 

The policy is not triggered because the project will not 
support activities related to forest exploitation or 
management or that might have potential adverse 
impacts on forested areas. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The project is not expected to finance acquisition, 
transport, distribution, disposal, storage or use of 
pesticides or similar chemicals that could threaten 
environmental and human health.  Nevertheless, OP 
4.09 is triggered because of the following related to 
the project: (i) livestock productivity enhancement via 
animal health, animal disease surveillance, animal 
health/vaccinations, and fight against pests, 
prevention and management; and (ii) farmers, for the 
agricultural productivity purpose, may use fertilizers 
and pesticides.  An Integrated Pest Management Plan 
(IPMP) will be prepared, consulted upon and publicly 
disclosed prior to appraisal. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

This policy is triggered because of the nature of 
possible civil works to be financed under component B 
which might lead to the unearthing of such PCR.  
Nevertheless, it is highly unlikely that any physical 
cultural resources will be impacted; nonetheless, the 
existing “Chance finds procedures” will be embedded 
in the ESMF to ensure that these aspects will be taken 
into account during project preparation and 
implementation. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
The policy is not triggered as there are no Indigenous 
Peoples in the project areas.

NIGER - AGRICULTURAL AND LIVESTOCK TRANSFORMATION PROJECT (P164509) 

 
 

  
Mar 04, 2018 Page 16 of 18  

     

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The Policy is triggered as the proposed project 
activities will require acquisition of land that could 
lead to some losses of assets, losses or restriction of 
access to some sources of livelihoods, resulting in 
either a temporary or permanent involuntary 
resettlement of project affected persons (PAP). 
However, since the physical footprint of project 
activities areas are mostly unknown at this juncture 
and will very likely be unknown prior to appraisal, the 
Borrower will prepare, consult upon, and publicly 
disclose prior to appraisal a Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF). During project implementation, the 
screening process will further determine whether land 
will be acquired and whether a subproject-specific 
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) will be required. If so, 
such a RAP would be duly consulted upon and publicly 
disclosed both in-country and on the World Bank 
website at the InfoShop prior to the physical start of 
project civil works. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 TBD 

The project may finance some water retention 
structures for excess water during the rainy season. 
This matter will be reviewed during the project 
preparation stage and pre-appraisal to assess whether 
or not OP/BP 4.37 should be triggered. The Policy of 
for now is to TBD until then. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
The project will not finance activities that will interfere 
with international watercourses; either in terms of 
water withdrawal or discharge of pollutants. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No The project intervention areas are not under dispute. 

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
May 31, 2018 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
The safeguard-related studies will be launched in early March 2018 and will be completed by May 14, 2018.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
1. Zambia is a landlocked country in Southern Africa, surrounded by Malawi, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo, 

Namibia, Angola, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. It has a surface area of 752,614 km2 and population 

estimated at 17.6 million people that is growing at an annual rate of 3.2%. The country is endowed with rich natural 

resources including minerals, freshwater, forests, wildlife and fertile land. Nearly 56% or 42 million hectares of the 

total land area is arable. The country is also home to globally significant ecosystems and biodiversity. About 40% of 

freshwater resources in the southern African region are found in Zambia alone. Zambia is characterized as a service-

oriented economy with the tertiary sector at 53.7%; Mining (principally copper, emeralds, zinc, lead and cobalt) at 

12.9%; Agriculture; Forestry and Fisheries at 9.9%; and Manufacturing at 7.9%. The 2017 World Bank Zambia 

Economic Brief indicates that Zambia’s national economy experienced domestic pressures in 2015. Economic growth 

fell to 2.9 percent in 2015 and contributed to increased poverty in rural communities. Among the main factors are 

the reduction in the price of copper, El Nino induced lower seasonal harvest, political uncertainty and the power 

crisis which impacted local business operations of all sectors. Economic growth increased to 3.8 percent in 2016 and 

to 3.5 percent in 2017. Economic growth is expected to continue rising with a projected GDP growth of 4.1 percent 

in 2018 and 4.7 percent in 2019. 

 

2. Zambia's economy is heavily dependent on natural resources, particularly mining and increasingly forestry 

resources. Agriculture is largely rain-fed. Rural economies and livelihoods depend almost entirely on renewable 

natural resources i.e. biodiversity, forests, wetlands, fisheries, water, etc. The productive capacity of landscapes 

nation-wide is compromised by various drivers across agriculture, infrastructure development, unsustainable use of 

forest resources, land use, energy and mining activities. These drivers solely or in combination reduce productive 

capacity and resilience of landscapes and undermine ecosystem services, particularly due to the impacts of climate 

variability and climate change.  

 

3. Zambia is endowed with vast forests. These productive landscapes support rural livelihoods and investment 

opportunities that hold potential for national socio-economic development. About 65% of land is covered by 

forests, of which 40% constitutes miombo woodland. The country has an array of protected areas that include 20 

National Parks; 39 Game Management Areas; 432 Forest Reserve; 59 Botanical Reserves; 42 Important Bird Areas; 

and 2 Bird Sanctuaries. The forest lands, therefore, represent the life-line of rural economies and daily subsistence. 

For example, the forest sector currently contributes about 5.2% to the nation’s GDP, and provides formal and 

informal employment to about 1.1 million people in the country. The forest sector is also the greatest contributor to 

carbon emissions (61% of total emissions in 2011). It is a sector, therefore, that holds opportunity to contribute to 



 
The World Bank  
Transforming landscapes for resilience and development in Zambia (P164764) 

 
 

  
July 12, 2018 Page 4 of 16  

     

national reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and for equitable sharing of both carbon and non-carbon benefits 

among stakeholders. However, the forest sector is under increasing pressure. From 2001 to 2017, Zambia lost 2.5 

million hectares or about 6% of total tree cover. This led to the release of 252Mt of carbon into the atmosphere1. 

According to FAO, current annual deforestation in Zambia is 160 000 hectares, which is approximately twice the size 

of New York City. Zambia is among the top ten deforested country’s in the world.  

 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 

4. Zambia has been implementing the World Bank led Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) aimed at 

strengthening Zambia 's institutional framework for climate resilience (while) improving the adaptive capacity of 

vulnerable communities in selected sub-basins. Investments supported by the Zambia PPCR on the ground include 

participatory adaptation, climate-resilient infrastructure and strategic program support in agriculture, water, 

livestock, fisheries and natural resources and climate information services. Adaptation to climate change is one of 

the nation’s development priorities because the Zambian economy, particularly the rural economy, is highly 

vulnerable to the impacts and effects of climate change. This has become very important because the country has 

already been experiencing frequent droughts, extreme temperatures and dry spells in some parts, and seasonal and 

flash floods in others. Floods and droughts have increased in frequency over the past three decades, costing the 

nation an estimated 0.4% in annual economic growth. These trends are expected to intensify in the future. Based on 

records from 1960 to 2003, the mean annual temperature has increased by 1.3oC. This gives an average of 0.3oC per 

decade. Within the same period, mean rainfall has decreased by an average of 1.9mm/month (2.3%) per decade 

since 1960.  

 

5. Through different land and forest-related policies, the Government seeks to manage productive landscapes to 

enhance forest products and services for improved income generation, poverty reduction, job creation and 

protection and maintenance of biodiversity, and contribute to mitigation of climate change. In the Forest Act 2015, 

the Government has given direction on the new configurations of forests to increase people’s participation in the 

management of forests and forest resources and in their ownership of forest benefits at micro-level. This therefore, 

forms basis for a firm socio-economic and legal engagement in the collective management, including the private 

sector to transform landscapes for resilience and development in Zambia.  

 

6. Zambia is a Party to a number of global Multilateral Environmental Agreements. It is a Party to the three Rio 

Conventions: the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (UNCBD); 

and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). In 2015, Zambia joined the Paris Agreement and 

submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC). As a Party, Zambia is mandated to respond to the 

policy directions and obligations of these Conventions. In this regard, the Government continues to pursue 

development goals that complement efforts from other development partners for socio-economic and 

environmental benefits. To realize the international as well as national development priorities, the Government has 

continued to pursue efforts to establish conducive policy and legislative instruments as well as strategic plans to 

address climate change and other sectoral development challenges. Among the pieces of legislation, the following

constitute a set of important policies that can anchor the development objective of TRALARD to increase the 

ecosystem resilience and productivity within vulnerable landscapes and enhance the disaster related preparedness 

of Zambia: Vision 2030; Seventh National Development Plan (7NDP, 2017); Second National Biodiversity Strategy and 

Action Plan (NBSAP2, 2015); National Policy on Environment (NPE, 2007); National Policy on Climate Change (NPCC, 

2017); National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS, 2012); Zambia National Forest Policy (ZNFP, 2014) and 

Forest Act (2015); National Agriculture Policy (NAP, 2016); Environmental Management Act (EMA, 2011); and the 

National Energy Policy (NEP, 2008) 

 

Relationship to CPF 

 

7. The proposed TRALARD project is aligned with the draft Zambia Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for the period 

FY18-FY21 which puts forward an integrated World Bank, IFC, and MIGA strategy to support Zambia’s development 

through the Seventh National Development Plan (7NDP). The project contributes to the CPF Objective Two on 

Increased resilience to hydrological, climate and environmental shocks and to associated outcomes: a) Local level 

community infrastructure and natural resources management practices reduce impact of hydrological shocks 

(droughts, floods) on livelihoods; b) Climate adaptation support to communities harmonized, institutionalized and 

decentralized; and c) Institutions for environmental governance strengthened. 

 

8. The Government has embraced an integrated approach to development investments at landscape level. This project 

builds on this vision, the CPF and Bank’s experience on climate resilience, particularly through the implementation 

of projects on resilience and adaptation priorities, including i) Zambia Strengthening Climate Resilience (PPCR Phase 

II); ii) Livestock Development Animal and Health Project (LDAHP); iii) Zambia Water Resources Development Project; 

iv) Irrigation Sector Development Project (ISDP); and v) Zambia Integrated Forest Landscape Project (ZIFLP). 

 

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 

9. To improve natural resource management in the northern region of Zambia to support sustainable livelihoods, and 
in the event of an eligible crisis or emergency, to provide immediate and effective response to the eligible crisis or 
emergency. 

 
10. The PDO will be achieved through activities under the following components: (a) Institutional Development and 

Capacity Building for Landscape Restoration and Resilience, (b) Sustainable Landscape Management Practices, (c) 

Infrastructure for Resilience and Market Access, and (d) Project Management, Coordination, and Monitoring. 

Through these components, TRALARD will offer a selection of interrelated activities that can be tailored to the needs 

of participating areas. The project also includes standard Contingency Emergency Response component. 

 
Project beneficiaries and expected outcomes 

 

11. Project beneficiaries include communities increasingly reliant on the exploitation of natural resources due to the 

absence of alternative sources of livelihoods and energy, partially resulting from the lack of sound management and 

planning. Rural communities, including women and children, will have an opportunity to take advantage of diversified 



 
The World Bank  
Transforming landscapes for resilience and development in Zambia (P164764) 

 
 

  
July 12, 2018 Page 6 of 16  

     

selection of livelihood options based on prudent, environmentally sound natural resource management. Local 

authorities will gain from strengthened institutions and policies and capacity to manage, plan, operate, and enforce 

regulations to achieve both environmental improvement and poverty reduction. Rural and urban communities will 

benefit from reliable and environmentally sound infrastructure that will improve market access and in a broader 

context will promote the creation of new economic opportunities for the region. 

 

Key Results (From PCN) 

 

12. Project activities will be designed to advance and develop three dimensions of the resilience capacity of the 

vulnerable communities: absorptive capacity, adaptive capacity, and transformative capacity. This approach will 

facilitate measuring resilience at project level with Results Framework (RF) indicators being connected to these three 

capacities. In addition, RF will include Predictive Proxy Indicators (PPI) to evaluate the effectiveness of forest related 

interventions, as suggested in the Forest Action Plan2.  

 
13. Key outcome indicators 

 

1. Land area under sustainable landscape management practices (CRI) (ha) 

2. Forest area brought under management plans (CRI) (ha) (intermediate) 

3. Fisheries management plans implemented (CRI) (count of water bodies and/or area) 

4. Diversified livelihoods activities adopted by households (count), of which households headed by women (percent) 

5. Number of households using resilience infrastructure supported by the project (count) 

6. Small scale farmers/producers with improved market access (count), of which households headed by women

Project level and intermediate indicators will be defined in the Project Appraisal Document. 

 

D. Concept Description 

 

14. In the 7th National Development Plan of Zambia for 2017-2021, the Government of Zambia recognizes the need to 

implement measures to reduce poverty through harnessing the potential of Luapula, Muchinga and Northern 

Province in agriculture, forestry, and tourism among other areas, and addressing the challenge of poor infrastructure. 

 

15. Given the complexity of socio-economic, environmental and climate change induced challenges facing the NRZ, 

TRALARD is proposed to bring the northern region to a new level of sustainable management of natural resources 

with expanded options for non natural resource based livelihoods and improved market access. The implementation 

of the program aims to trasform the region into a vibrant ecological and socio-economic system preserving the 

environment, resilient to climate change consequences, and offering communities broader development 

opportunities.

16. TRALARD is focused on addressing the main drivers of environmental degradation, natural resource exploitation and 

persistent poverty. The project aims to contribute to improving the sustainability of poor rural community livelihoods 

in an environment already stressed by climate change impacts and rapid population growth. TRALARD will build on 

the lessons learnt from the successful PPCR currently under implementation in Zambia. For example, PPCR has 

worked with local structures and implementation partners to improve and mainstream climate risk into livelihood 

option decisions, local development planning, and implementation capacity and has gained experience in conducting 

microprojects in the intervention area. This experience informs the design of TRALARD.  

 

17. The examination of economic realities during the fact-finding mission to the NRZ reveals closely interconnected and 

mutually determined processes of natural resources degradation and deepening poverty. For example, declining fish 

stock in Lake Tanganyika and other water bodies forced some fisherman to switch to charcoal burning as an 

alternative source of income. While fish stock still continues to decline due to climate change impacts and increasing 

consumption by the growing population, forests are under increased pressure from the population whose economic 

options are severely limited and alternative sources of energy are absent. Unchecked access to natural resources and 

the lack of enforcement to protect them by authorities invite their unsustainable expolitation. As a result, the poverty 

level in the region is increasing while the natural resource base that those communities rely on is being destroyed.  

 

18. Funding and implementation capacity constraints mean that not all 26 districts will participate in TRALARD in the first 

phase. The selection criteria for districts that will be included in the first phase will include: (i) most vulnerable 

districts based on assessment of poverty and vulnerability maps; (ii) proximity to protected areas; (iii) districts 

bordering Lake Tanganyika; (iv) preparedness and commitment of districts and capacity of implementing 

stakeholders. The number of districts will be determined during preparation.  

 

19. TRALARD aims to improve value chains through greater community and private sector engagement, better market 

information and priority infrastructure. Sustainable resource management requires that environmental benefits are 

strongly linked to improved livelihoods and poverty reduction. The project design promotes greater community and 

private sector participation in sustainable natural resources management as the most direct path to fostering this 

linkage.  

 

20. Contributing to the sustainability aspect of the project, TRALARD intends to facilitate establishing robust mechanisms 

to monitor key environmental, climate and weather parameters, model longer-term challenges, including climate 

change and population growth, and develop measures to address issues in a long-term perspective. 

 

21. The project places emphasis on the adoption of advanced technologies in the natural resource management practices 

and in the measurement, monitoring, and reporting of project impacts. The application of innovative and disruptive 

technologies such as remote sensing, drones, mobile phone and online apps, biotech, water and energy saving 

technologies, will be examined during the preparation stage.  

 
22. The following areas of activities have been determined at the initial preparation stage of the project. These 

components are defined with a view of (a), (b) tackling immediate tasks of reversing degradation through adaptation

Transforming landscapes for resilience and development in Zambia (P164764) 

 
 

  
July 12, 2018 Page 8 of 16  

     

and alternative livelihoods measures, and (c) improving infrastructure for resilience and facilitating creation of new 

opportunities through more developed market access. 

 

23. Component 1. Institutional Development and Capacity Building for Landscape Restoration and Resilience 

(indicative amount US$8 million) 

The aim of this component is to strengthen government institutions at the national, local and community level to 

develop and implement new approaches for sustainable natural resource management This will be achieved by 

reviewing and updating certain policies, providing better information, and improving the development planning and 

budget process by mainstreaming climate risk and environmental considerations into development plans. This 

component will finance policy and regulatory reviews, province, district and ward level development planning, 

technical assistance (TA), workshops, and trainings.  

 

1.1. Policy and Institutional strengthening and capacity building: This component will support the review of key 

natural resource policies and regulations relating to the forestry and fisheries sector. It will support the 

government to implement the Statutory Instrument NO 11 of 2018 which allows for community management 

for forests. In addition, this component will support policy analysis on the options and alternatives for charcoal 

production, enforcement, and government regulation to license charcoal production. The activities will also 

help development and disseminate a manual on community participatory co-management; as well as the 

establishment of effective interdepartmental structures to organize collaboration at the ecosystem level to 

enhance integrated approaches to natural resource management and coordinated land use planning and 

management. The outputs will focus on: integrated approaches for community mobilization, partnerships for 

sustainable forest landscape restoration (FLR), and targeted studies, for example, on models, resource 

mobilization for sustainable PA management. This will enhance the ability of the government to determine 

sectors that hold greater promise to transform landscapes for resilience and development and scale up 

interventions. 

 

1.2.  Advance the beneficial use of hydro-meteorological information: The project will finance the improvement of 

early warning systems and related institutional systems to improve the resilience of communities to climate 

change impacts. This will include technical assistance to develop a long term strategic plan to strengthen the 

institutions i.e. Zambia Meteorology Department (ZMD), Disaster Management and Mitigation unit(DMMU), 

Water Resources Management Authority (WARMA) etc. responsible for delivering meteorological and 

hydrological information, data management and forecasting systems. This sub-component will introduce the 

concept of using hydro-met information for better decision making and delivery that information to local 

governments and primary producers: (for water resources, landscape management, disaster management, 

agriculture, environment, hydropower utilities, PAs.); (c) priority infrastructure rehabilitation identified in the 

Hydromet Master Plan developed under the World Bank Water Resource project (including hydromet 

infrastructure and related office refurbishment and equipment); and (d) community training, awareness 

campaigns, knowledge on improved climate information use and disseminationto end-users nationaly, with 

specific focus in the Chambeshi-Luapula catchment area.

24. Component 2. Sustainable Landscape Management Practices (indicative amount US$32.5 million) 

The component aims to improve the livelihoods and resilience of rural communities by improving the management 

of the rich natural resources base that rural communities are dependent upon through: (a) ecosystem based 

integrated natural resource management planning; (b) improved management of protected areas and protection of 

environmental services; and (c) diversification and increased sustainability of rural livelihoods.  

 

2.1. Invesment in ecosystem based Integrated Natural Resource Management Planning (INRMP): This activity will 

support the preparation and implementation of INRMP plans in the project targeted area. These plans will be 

based on the assessment of the available natural resources and their conditions, as well as the sustainable 

levels of production. The plans will be done in year one. They will be developed and implemented with the 

involvement of relevant stakeholders, including communities, cooperatives, and local government, and will 

be based on physical, ecological, and socio-economic baseline data. 

 

2.2. Improved Management of Protected Areas (PA) and Reserves: This activity will support the effective and 

sustainable development of the three PA systems in the northern region of Zambia – Lavushi Manda National 

Park, Lusenga Plain National Park and Nsumbu National Park – to preserve the biodiversity and ecosystem 

services for the well-being of people with focus on forest dependent communities and potenital to develop 

tourism opportunities. This support will include: (1) preparation of protected areas management plans; (2) 

capacity assessment of the staff and analysis of the financial resources required to fully protect the protected 

areas; (3) priority park infrastructure such as staff offices and housing nearer to the park; (4) equipment 

including vehicles, GPS, computers; disruptive technology for monitoring animal populations, poaching 

activities; (5) training.  

 

2.3 Strengthen opportunities for primary producers to transform their livelihoods into market based enterprises: 

The main aim of the activity is to identify key challenges, risks and opportunities for transforming livelihoods 

of producers into market based enterprises. The project will provide resources to conduct value chain studies 

(including secondary sources of information) to identify key challenges to market entry and design 

interventions to incentivize smallholder producers to initiate viable enterprises for increasing productivity, 

incomes and resilience to climate change. This component will draw from the lessons learnt during the pilot 

to support primary producers and small business operaters under the Zambia PPCR private sector approcah. 

 
2.4. Sustainable livelihoods: Rural populations in the north are dependent on subsistence agriculture and fishing, 

both of which have seen severe declines in productivity and have increased risk due to climate variablility. 

This activity aims to: increase smallholder production and productivity of diversified value chains; reduce 

farmers risk through insurance and prudent and informed risk taking strategies; improving access to markets; 

and diversifying into alternative livelihoods that are non resource based enterprises. This will be done through 

a program of support which encourages farmers to adopt conservation agriculture practices, promotes 

savings, provides technologies to reduce post harvest loss, establishes rural aggregation centers and linkages 

to buyers and advanced purchase contracts, and persue alternative livelihoods that are non natural resource 

based businesses. The alternative livelihood activities will target women and youths to lifting up the socio-

economic situation particularly of women who use natural resources with inferior financial value compared

to men. The roster of alternative livelihoods will include increased rearing of livestock, agroforestry, 

agroprocessing, aqua culture, fingerlings production, fish processing, feed making for fisheries, bee keeping, 

caterpillars and mushrooms production, and other service industries such as tailoring, hair dressing etc.  

 

25. Component 3: Infrastructure for Resilience and Market Access (indicative amount US$27 million IDA) 

Activities under this component aim at supporting and improving NRZ infrastructure in vulnerable areas that suffers 

from the lack of investments and is additionally adversely impacted by climatic changes. Such impacts include drastic 

changes in rain patterns resulting in floods and droughts, shortages in water, changes in wind patterns, lack of 

passable roads and damaged bridges leaving entire communities cut off from the basic services and goods during 

floods where durations are becoming extended. This increases the likelihood of lack of water and nutrition, diseases, 

livestock loss etc. In addition, this component will help identify ways to improve market access for primary producers 

who often lack opportunities and/or knowledge on the ways to make their produce accessible to the market. 

 

3.1.  Investments in resilience strengthening infrastructure: identify in concert with stakeholders the most sensitive 

pieces of small-scale infrastructure in the most vulnerable areas that require prompt investments. 

Infrastructure is the backbone of well-being and safety of people and its reliability and even presence in such 

poorly serviced regions is central to communities’ resilience. Potentially, they include (a) feeder roads, 

bridges, culverts, (b) water harvesting structures (check and sand dams, earthen bunds, solar-powered 

irrigation), and (c) traditional and alternative energy sources.  

 

3.2. Examining opportunities for restoration of traditional canals: conduct feasibility study on possible restoration 

of traditional canals in the North. Traditional canals in Zambia play multiple roles: transportation, water body, 

fish harvesting, and traditional ceremonies. The canals in the North are in a state of disrepair after decades of 

no investment or maintenance, yet their potential for transportation and commerce remains high. This sub-

component will draw from the experience acquired from similar successful operations under the PPCR in the 

Barotse sub-region.  

 
3.3. Facilitated access to markets: determine ways and forms to support producers in establishing access to 

markets. Jointly with stakeholders, including producers, authorities, private companies and consumers, the 

project will examine constraints and bottlenecks in establishing connection between products and markets 

and suggest measures to address them. It is not an uncommon situation when farmers’ produce – mangos, 

oranges – goes to waste because farmers have no ability to deliver their products to potential consumers. This 

inability undermines income and negatively affects resilience of producers.  

 

26. Component 4: Contingency Emergency Response Component (CERC) (Standardized)  

This contingency component can be triggered by a joint Government and World Bank agreement in case of an 

emergency. This component had been embedded in the project to finance early recovery and/or specific emergency 

works, goods, and services, in case of eligible emergencies/crises/disaster caused by natural or man-made hazard 

including public health crisis. The mechanism is designed to support enhancement of preparedness, early recovery 

activities, and provision of rapid response to disaster that can be implemented in a relatively short period. This 

component was considered necessary because of the inherent in Zambia’s current socioeconomic and climate related 



 
The World Bank  
Transforming landscapes for resilience and development in Zambia (P164764) 

 
 

  
July 12, 2018 Page 11 of 16  

     

hazards (unexpected flooding or drought, an aggravation of the state of fragility, as a result of influx of large groups 

of displaced people ( cross boarder and internal displacements) could potentially shift priorities. Reallocation of funds 

to CERC can only be done when there is a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or society causing 

widespread human, economic, or environmental losses that exceed the ability of the affected community or society 

to cope using its own resources. Following such a disaster event where both the region and national resources cannot 

sufficiently and adequately address the situation, the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) may trigger 

activation of CERC according to national law and subject to the World Bank’s activation policy.  

 

27. Component 5: Project Management, Coordination, and Monitoring (US$7.5 million IDA) 

This component will finance TA, works, goods, workshops, and operational costs to support the project’s day-to-day 

implementation and management, including procurement, FM, environmental and social safeguards, and 

preparation of annual work plans and organization of audit reports. The component also includes the design and 

implementation of a communication strategy to report on the project results and to raise awareness about land 

degradation, restoration and climate change impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation. It also supports the M&E system 

to report on the expected project’s results (disaggregating by gender, where appropriate) and systematizes the 

project’s lessons learned. The component also finances impact evaluation to assess project’s impacts on specific 

elements such as adopted livelihoods.  

  

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The project covers the Northern region of Zambia (NRZ), which includes Luapula, Northern, and Muchinga provinces. This 

area has vast coverage of pristine Miombo forest, four national parks, four lakes, water falls and many rivers. They lie in 
the third agro ecological zone with the annual rainfall of about 1200 mm. NRZ encompasses over 35% of managed lands 
which contribute to protecting and maintaining large intact natural landscapes. The region is endowed with natural 
resources that include rich biodiversity and half of the wetlands of international importance listed under the Ramsar 
Convention. These wetlands contain habitats for several important fauna and flora species, are a natural flood controller 
and important for groundwater recharge. The natural resources in the area also represent a life-line for rural economies 
and daily subsistence.  
 
The provinces are home to over 3.5 million people with record high levels of poverty 81% (Luapula), 79% (Northern) and 

69% (Muchinga). The main economic stay for the people of this area is agriculture due to the availability of arable land, 
abundant water bodies and good annual rainfall. The area has experienced vulnerabilities due to climate variability and 
human related activities posing a challenge to conserving natural resources. Factors contributing to vulnerabilities include 
forest lands under threat from human encroachment for settlement and growing food insecurities due to population 
growth. Increased mining activities result in growing demand for energy met through heightened production of charcoal 
and logging. An estimated 16,000,000 hectares out of 21,423,600 hectares total land (75%) is under threat of degradation 
from these activities.. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The PPCR PIU under Ministry of National Planning and Development has implemented and monitored safeguard

Transforming landscapes for resilience and development in Zambia (P164764) 

 
 

  
July 12, 2018 Page 12 of 16  

     

compliance in accordance with Bank policies. The project performance has been rated satisfactory, while the risk has 
been moderate. The PIU has a dedicated Safeguard Specialist who is supported by Community Adaptation Specialists in 
each district. The PIU has gained substantial experience with Bank funded projects through their active participation in 
the design and preparation of the Forest Investment Project, Displaced Person's and Border Communities, and the 
Zambia Integrated Forest Landscape Project (ZIFLP). The PIU played a pivotal role in setting up the ZIFLP PIU which is now 
operational. 
  
Given the PIU's involvement in design, preparation and implementation of climate resilient projects, the PIU is being 

transformed into a national coordinating unit that will assume a supervisory role in monitoring implementation of the 
TRALARD project at the national level.To fulfill  this new role, more experts (including Environmental and Social) will be 
recruited to strengthen their capacity to manage environmental and social risks.  
 
For the implementation of the TRALARD project, three PIUs will be established at provincial level (i.e. one for each target 

province). The staffing structure will include Environmental and Social experts as key personnel. These will collaborate 
with District officials that will be assigned to the project. Working through existing district structures will enhance project 
ownership and contribute to sustaining project investment. However, this being the initial engagement with Provincial 
and District counterparts in the 3 provinces, a capacity assessment will be undertaken as part of project preparation. 
Results on the assessment will feed into the a capacity building plan that will be developed for the project.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The  policy on environmental assessment has been 
triggered as the proposed  TRALARD project will 
involve infrastructural works. The  infrastructural 
works are envisaged to be undertaken under 
component  2 and 3 of the project. Component 2: of 
the project will involve the promotion of sustainable 
landscape management practices and this will 
incorporate the improved management of protected 
areas  and reserves. Lavushi Manda , Lusenga Plain 
and Nsumbu National Parks and their buffer Game 
Management Areas (GMA's) have been identified as 
potential beneficiary parks. The project will support 
the construction and rehabilitation of  infrastructure 
such as, park structures, staff offices and their housing 
in the vicinity  of the parks. Component 3: of the 
project will involve the investment in infrastructure for 
resilience and market access. Investments will focus 
on the  sensitive pieces of small-scale infrastructure in 
the most vulnerable areas that require urgent

attention. These will include  the periodic 
maintenance of  feeder roads (existing dirt or gravel 
roads) and support structures such as small access 
bridges and placement of culvert,  water harvesting 
structures (check and sand dams, earthen bunds, 
solar-powered irrigation), and the restoration of 
existing traditional canals.  
 
Since the project is at concept stage,  the scope and 
beneficiary areas have not yet been fully defined, an 
ESMF and  associated RPF is currently under 
preparation to assess potential safeguards 
risks/impacts associated with project activities and 
subprojects.In addition, line with the Bank's guidance 
on Contingent Emergency Response 
Components(CERC); Component 4 (CERC): This 
Component requires that the ESMF includes specific 
section (or a CERC-specific ESMF) describing the 
potential emergencies and the types of activities likely 
to be financed, and provide a preliminary evaluation 
of potential risks and mitigation measures associated 
with them. The ESMF will ensure to include a section 
addressing the CERC guideline. Once finalized, ESMF 
will be formally cleared by the Bank and disclosed at 
national level and on the Bank’s website.   
 
 
Furthermore, a Strategic Environmental and Social 
Assessment (SESA) covering 4 out of 10 provinces was 
conducted under a similar project,  PPCR in 2013. 
Since the  proposed TRALARD beneficiary areas were 
excluded in the initial assessment. The SESA will be 
updated to include Northern, Luapula and Muchinga 
provinces. For the benefit of future project, expanding 
the scope to cover the entire country will be 
considered. It is anticipated that TRALARD project will 
benefit from the findings of the SESA which will be 
incorporated in the development of INRM Plans and 
PA Management Plan.  
 
 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No

areas and  habitats such as wetlands and national 
parks. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

The Bank policy on forest has been triggered as the 
TRALARD will involve afforestation activities to 
improve forest health.  The project will provide 
incentives to communities in beneficiary areas to 
protect vegetation cover in  the existing  forests and  
regenerate deforested areas 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The policy on pest management has been triggered as 
the project will involve livelihood activities that may 
directly or indirectly support the use of pesticides. A 
Pest Management Plan (PMP) will be included in the 
ESMF. 
 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

The policy on physical culture resources has been 
precautionary triggered as the project will be 
implemented across three provinces and the works 
may unearth artefacts of cultural and heritage value. A 
chance find procedure will be included in the ESMF to 
guide, should a chance find occur. It will further layout 
the process for notifying the National Heritage 
Conservation Commission (NHCC) in case of an 
occurrence.  
 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 

The policy on Indigenous Peoples has not been 
triggered as the project will be implemented in 
Luapula, Northern and Muchinga Provinces where 
there is no presence of Indigenous Peoples as defined 
by Bank Policy. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

Policy on Involuntary Resettlement has been 
triggered. This will apply to selected project activities 
which may result in land acquisition for the 
establishment of priority infrastructure to support 
local tourist operators. A RPF will be prepared in 
consultation with key stakeholders. The RPF will guide 
preparation of the RAP to address physical and 
economic impacts that may arise from project 
implementation. 
Luapula, Muchinga and Northern provinces are 
endowed with forests and national parks where 
communities derive natural resources for livelihood 
activities. Possible restrictions to natural resources 
arising from project implementation will be managed 
through preparation of a Process Framework.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 

1. The collapse of global oil prices caused a fiscal and economic crisis in 2016 and 2017. Low oil prices left Chad’s 
external debt unsustainable and threw the economy into deep recession. Falling revenues, together with the obligation 

to service an oil collateralized commercial loan, rendered the government illiquid. In fact, more than 80 percent of oil 
revenues were used to directly service debt owed to Glencore, with only about 15 percent entering treasury accounts in

cash terms. Real GDP contracted by 6.3 percent in 2016 and 3 percent in 2017, opening a large negative output gap. This 
was reflected in a sharp drop in CPI inflation from 3.7 percent in 2015 to -1.1. percent in 2016, and 0.2 percent in 2017.  

2. In response to the oil price shock, the government had to pursue severe fiscal consolidation. In early 2016, the 
authorities introduced cash-based budgeting and adopted an Emergency Fiscal Plan aimed at mitigating the short-term 
impact of the crisis. Significant expenditure cuts led to a fall in the non-oil primary deficit from 9.7 percent of non-oil GDP 
at end-2015 to 3.8 percent at end-2017, while the overall fiscal deficit (cash basis) was contained at 2.5 percent of non-oil 
GDP in 2017. In 2018, the overall fiscal balance is estimated to be at -0.6 percent of non-oil GDP. Domestically financed 
public investment took a major hit and dropped from 9.8 percent of non-oil GDP in 2014 to 0.7 percent in 2017, while 
recurrent spending dropped from 16.6 percent to 13.7 percent and arrears accumulated. 

3. To return to fiscal and debt sustainability, commercial debt restructuring as well as strong external budget support 
were necessary. An important challenge has been to close an original financing gap of US$1.222 billion in 2017 and 2018. 
Following almost a year of negotiation, Chad and Glencore signed a final debt restructuring agreement in June 2018, notably 
linking debt service to oil revenues through a dynamic cash sweep mechanism. This arrangement reduces the debt service 
to revenue ratio, mitigates the fiscal risk of oil price volatility, reduces the financing gap and returns Chad to a sustainable 
debt path. Furthermore, authorities have financed part of the deficit by issuing bonds in the regional market, however, banks 
have approached their regulatory limits on Chadian Government securities. Ultimately, Chad’s development partners have 
provided budget support requiring the Government to adhere to the rules and mechanisms as agreed for the restructuring 
of its commercial debt while further rationalizing public financial management (PFM) and tightening expenditure controls. 

4. Despite fiscal stabilization translating into gradual recovery, years of recession and austerity have constrained 
social welfare and poverty-reduction.1   Real GDP expected to grow at an estimated 2.6 percent in 2018, largely supported 
by increases in oil prices and oil production. In the non-oil economy, favorable weather conditions and the privatization 
of the cotton public enterprise are expected to improve the agriculture sector’s contribution to (non-oil) GDP growth. 
However, in the absence of a well-targeted and effective social safety net (SSN), the poor and vulnerable have been deeply 
affected by the crisis. During the oil boom, poverty rates declined (from 55 percent in 2003 to 47 percent in 2011), 
however, the absolute number of poor increased from 4.9 million to 5.6 million due to population growth. Progress on 
non-monetary poverty also presents a mixed picture. Since 2014 and up until 2018, dwindling fiscal resources and poor 
social spending execution have disrupted vital public services despite efforts to protect priority social and productive 
spending 

Relationship to CPF 
 

5. The Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for FY16-FY202 is based on three engagement themes: (i) 
strengthening management of public resources; (ii) improving returns to agriculture and building value chains; and (iii) 
building human capital and reducing vulnerability. The program supported by the proposed second Development Policy 
Grant is closely aligned with the three pillars of the CPF and designed to leverage World Bank investment lending projects 
and Technical Assistance activities across the four pillars, notably in the areas of domestic resource mobilization, tax policy 
and administration, SOE management, oil sector capacity building, agriculture value chain support and productivity 
enhancement, and social safety nets development.

The Program Development Objectives and pillars of the proposed operation are to (1) enhance fiscal risk management; 
(2) improve oil revenue transparency and management; (3) promote resilience and economic diversification in key real 
sectors; and (4) increase social protection for the poor and vulnerable. 
 
Key Results  
 

6. This second programmatic Economic Recovery and Resilience (ERR) DPO will support Chad in building resilience 
and consolidating transition to a sustainable, structural growth path. Building on the First Economic Recovery and 
Resilience DPO (P163424), this second grant in a series of two solidifies the shift of World Bank support towards a 
structural resilience and growth agenda. The authorities aim at sustaining recovery, fostering economic diversification, 
and developing coping mechanisms for the poor and vulnerable. Four intertwined pillars combine structural measures to 
enhance fiscal risk management with boosting economic diversification and social resilience. Improved debt, Public 
Financial and oil revenue management are complemented by increased productivity in agriculture and competitive, open 
access information and communication technologies (ICT). Finally, putting in place a well-targeted and fully operational 
social protection system adds an explicit micro layer of resilience. 

 

D. Concept Description 
 

7. The proposed operation supports structural policy reform to improve debt and oil revenue management, 
increase productivity in agriculture and ICT telecom sectors and build a well targeted social safety net.  The operation 
is programmed under IDA18 with a total amount of US$40 million. It follows the First Programmatic Economic Recovery 
and Resilience DPO that passed Board in September 2018, as well as a 2017 standalone Emergency Fiscal Stabilization 
Operation that was conceived as a first stage supporting Chad in its stabilization effort while preparing the ground for the 
second stage, i.e. structural measures to build resilience and start sustainable recovery in the context of this programmatic 
DPO series. 

8. The main policy pillars are to (1) enhance fiscal risk management; (2) improve oil revenue transparency and 
management; (3) promote resilience and economic diversification in key real sectors; and (4) increase social protection 
for the poor and vulnerable. First, this programmatic series aims at enhancing fiscal risk management through (a) 
improved debt management; (b) rationalization of tax expenditures; (c) streamlining the payroll for enhanced fiscal space; 
and (d) improved oversight and transparency in the management of SOEs. Second, to improve the contribution of the oil 
sector to fiscal sustainability and economic resilience it promotes (i) a functional oil revenue management mechanism; (ii) 
transparency in the financial performance of the SHT; and (iii) improved control over oil production costs. Third, to 
increase diversification and resilience of Chad’s population in face of economic and climatic shocks, the operation (a) 
contributes to greater agricultural productivity for more sustainable and inclusive growth; and (b) strengthens the 
contribution of the ICT sector to inclusive growth through enhanced affordability and coverage of services, as well as 
improved transparency for public and private service delivery. Fourth, it increases social protection for the poor and most 
vulnerable groups including refugees, by developing an effective and well-targeted SSN system, and implementing cash 
transfers.  

9. The operation is well aligned with the strategic objectives of the 2017-2021 National Development Plan (NDP). 
It focuses on three of the four strategic Pillars of the government’s program, including Pillar 2, strengthening good 
governance and the rule of law, Pillar 3, development of a robust and competitive economy, and Pillar 4, improving the 
quality of life of the Chadian population.  



 
The World Bank  
Chad Second Programmatic Economic Recovery and Resilience Grant (P168606) 

 
 

  
 Page 5 of 6  

     

10. This second programmatic DPO will also help catalyze private investment through improving the investment 
climate and creating opportunities in key sectors of the economy. Maximizing the impact of development financing is a 
central medium-term objective. The importance of concessional finance in supporting inclusive economic growth should 
be gradually reduced and compensated by private sector activity and investment: 1) Improved debt management and SOE 
oversight will reduce fiscal risk and create fiscal space for effective public investment able to crowd in private investment; 
2) at the same time, enabling competitive input markets in agriculture (here through effective agricultural extension 
services and high-quality seeds) and telecommunication (here through a competitive, open access fiber optics 
infrastructure) will not only break power of inefficient SOEs, but also lower entry and business costs across the economy. 
In the medium-term, it creates permanent opportunity for competition and innovation as well as significant consumer 
welfare gains. 

 

E. Poverty and Social Impacts and Environmental Aspects 
 
Poverty and Social Impacts 
 
11. The proposed programmatic Development Policy Grant is expected to have a positive impact on poverty 
reduction in the medium- and long- term. Actions supported by this operation are expected to help decrease poverty in 
the medium- and long-term through the promotion of inclusive growth in agriculture, and the development of more 
affordable ICT services and broader coverage in underserved areas. In addition, a properly targeted expansion of the 
Social Safety Net system has the potential to have a significant impact on allowing households to move out of poverty 
and strengthen household resilience to shocks.  
 
Environmental Impacts 
 

12. The reforms and policy actions supported by the proposed operation are not likely to have significant negative 
effects on the country’s environment, forests and other natural resources. All the actions are policy-oriented; they do 
not support direct investment in environmentally impactful projects or involve policy actions with significant 
environmental consequences. The assessment of potential impacts related to actions supported by the DPO will rely on 
the existing national legal and regulatory framework and will be monitored and addressed through the national 
procedures in place in Chad. Environmental Assessment (EA) is a legal requirement in Chad and is widely applied to all 
developmental projects. The EA process is based on Presidential Decree No. 630/PR/PM/MEERH/2010 on EA regulations 
and the ministerial decision No. 039/PR/PM/MERH/SG/DGE/DEELCPN/2012 with respect to the general guidelines and 
procedures for EA. The department of EA and pollution control in the Ministry of Environment and Fisheries is 
institutionally charged with reviewing and clearing environmental impact assessment (EIA) documents.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
The proposed Development Policy Operation (DPO) supports the Government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic 
in the context of a deteriorating security and humanitarian situation. Burkina Faso was among the first countries in 
Sub-Saharan Africa hit by COVID-19 and the Government took early and decisive action to contain and mitigate the 
spread of the virus. Prior to COVID-19, the country has experienced a rapidly deteriorating security situation since 
2018 with persistent armed violence that has severe humanitarian consequences. Against this backdrop, the COVID-
19 pandemic is transmitted through external and internal channels with a substantial economic impact. The COVID-19 
crisis is worsening the poverty and social conditions in the country. The proposed operation will help the Government 
tackle the COVID-19 crisis and address structural issues to reduce poverty and inequality in a sustainable manner to

improve the social conditions over the long term. The macroeconomic policy framework is adequate for the proposed 
operation with the risk of overall debt distress assessed as moderate.  
 

Relationship to CPF 
The Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for FY18-FY23, which is embedded in the twin goals of ending extreme 
poverty and promoting shared prosperity in a sustainable manner, provides the overarching framework for this 
operation. Policy reforms supported through this emergency operation are consistent with all three pillars of the CPF 
with other projects complementing the operation to achieve CPF outcomes. First, policy reforms related to public 
investment reprioritization (in combination with the the Emergency Recurrent Cost Financing Project ([P169486]) and 
access to credit (supported by the Financial Inclusion Support Project [P164786]) support the acceleration of 
sustainable private-sector-led growth for job creation (CPF Pillar 1). Further, policy reforms related to health (linked 
to Health Services Reinforcement Project [P164696]) and social protection (complemented by the Social Safety Net 
Project [P160371]) contribute to investing in human capital and social protection systems (CPF Pillar 2). Finally, policy 
reforms related to the digitalization of the public administration (supported by the Burkina Faso eGovernment Project 
[P155645]) and the governance of COVID funds (linked to the Economic Governance and Citizen Engagement Project 
[P155121]) contribute to strengthening governance and supporting citizen engagement (CPF Pillar 3). 
 

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  
 
This operation aims at mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 shock on lives and livelihoods, and laying foundations 
for a resilient recovery. 

 
Key Results  
This operation seeks to achieve results in multiple areas. In the health area, the operation seeks to improve the capacity 
to respond across all phases of the epidemic and to increase health system resilience. The social protection field, it seeks 
to facilitate access to services and strengthen the country’s response to COVID-19 and other crises. Further, this operation 
supports also business continuity of the state and prepares the digital transformation. Moreover, the DPO is expected to 
improve transparency and accountability in the use of COVID-19 funds and accelerate the response to future crisis. In 
addition, it will help improve the efficacy and efficiency of priority spending. Finally, the DPO envisions to improve access 
to credit for individuals, micro, small and medium enterprises and improve debt management and transparency. 
 

D. Concept Description 
 
The proposed operation is based on reforms included in the Government’s COVID-19 Response Plan, enacted in the Head 
of State’s address to the Nation. The plan is the result of recommendations from the National Pandemic Management 
Committee chaired by the Prime Minister and comprising a dozen sectoral ministries, technical and financial partners, 
and the civil society organizations. In addition, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank has intensified the policy 
dialogue in the health, social protection, education and agriculture sectors.  
 
The proposed operation supports the Government’s Government’s Emergency Response Plan through several angles. 
First, the DPO will strengthen the crisis response through the implementation of a national epidemiologic monitoring 
system. Second, the operation will help strengthen the Government’s response strategy through better identification 
and targeting of the most vulnerable, fast, adapted and transparent PFM and procurement procedures, and better, faster 
and if needed, contactless public services. Third, the operation will help strengthen the resilience of MSMEs and the 
informal sector through easier and better access to credit. Fourth, the DPO will help speed up and complete the ongoing 
public spending reprioritization exercise (with a focus on investment projects). Finally, the operation will support Burkina

Faso’s macroeconomic stability through two channels: a more efficient public spending, and a better management and 
transparency of public debt. 
 

E. Poverty and Social Impacts, and Environmental, Forests, and Other Natural Resource Aspects 
 
Poverty and Social Impacts 
The measures related to the health sector have strongly positive poverty and social impacts. The first sub-action supports 
the development and implementation for the large-scale pilot phase of the development and rollout of a One Health 
system. Improving preparedness, notification, investigation, response, and epidemic management capacity across the 
actors will mitigate against risks that affect both rural (animal husbandry and crops) and urban areas (shutdown effects, 
risk of transmission due to at-risk living conditions). The second sub-action through its information component increases 
targeting and coordination of resources and enables the provision of proper inputs in a timely and cost-effective manner. 
Reducing the duration of the epidemic will reduce the risk to populations, particularly the poor. The third sub-action is 
consistent with the CPF focus to increase service availability to all, but particularly the poor. Increasing prioritization of 
activities and investments and the focus on results will support better health results at lower total cost.  
 
Environmental, Forests, and Other Natural Resource Aspects 
Policy reform in the area of public investment is expected to promote climate-smart infrastructure investments. The 
revised Public Investment Program will include a list of prioritized investment projects resulting from a multi-criteria 
analysis. Impacts on and from climate change are among those criteria. Other criteria are project maturity, economic 
return, and the impact on growth and jobs. For example, in the area of urban roads the following criteria are taken into 
consideration: (i) all-weather pavement resurfacing with material that prevents water damage; (ii) construction of wider 
drains and culverts as well as slope stabilization to accommodate heavy rainfall; and (iii) elevation of bridges, tunnels, 
and roads in flood prone locations to allow for increased amounts of runoff from torrential rainfall to be transported 
away from vulnerable areas.

I. Introduction and Context
Country Context
The countries of West Africa belong to the Economic Community of West Africa States 
(ECOWAS), which comprises 15 countries and is home to more than 310 million people. ECOWAS 
is a regional organization that serves to promote economic integration across the West Africa 
region. The region is very heterogeneous in terms of cultural, economic and human development. 
Overall, member states rank low on the United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) human 
development index; as of 2014, life expectancy at birth and gross national income per capita of 
countries in the region ranged from 45.6 to 75.1 and 873 to 6,365 respectively.

Sectoral and Institutional Context
Over the last four decades, the world has witnessed one to three newly emerging infectious diseases

annually. The West Africa region is both a hotspot for emerging infectious diseases and a region 
where the burden of zoonotic diseases is particularly high. In this region, emerging and re-emerging 
diseases at the human-animal-ecosystems interface are occurring with increased frequency. As 
evidenced by the recent Ebola epidemics in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, highly contagious 
diseases in this region cross borders easily and have the potential to turn into pandemics. These add 
to the ongoing burden of neglected and endemic human and animal diseases, including zoonosis.  
 
Pandemics and epidemics have potential catastrophic effects on human and animal life, ecosystems, 
and on national economies. From 1997-2009, major outbreaks of fatal infectious diseases such as 
the human pandemic influenza (H1N1), highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1), Creutzfeld-
Jakob disease, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and EVD caused an estimated US$80 
billion in economic losses. Additionally, a recent analysis by the World Bank (WB) shows that a 
severe pandemic such as the 1918 Spanish Flu could cost approximately US$3 trillion globally, an 
estimate comparable to the impact of the 2008 global financial crisis.  
 
The pandemic of H1N1; epidemics of SARS, H5N1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome 
Coronavirus (MERS-CoV); and recent outbreaks of EVD are reminders of persistent risk of 
infectious, zoonotic diseases, and the economic losses they cause. Animal losses from zoonotic 
diseases are also high. On average, about half of all annual losses of Livestock Units (LSU) reported 
on average by veterinary services to the OIE-WAHID database from 2006 to 2009 were the result of 
zoonotic diseases. 
 
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents an increasing global health threat as resistant pathogens 
can be transmitted across healthcare facilities, in communities, and across international borders. A 
review of some disease control and prevention measures adopted in the human health sector shows 
that resistance to inexpensive and effective antimicrobial drugs has emerged at an alarming rate, 
increasing the likelihood that many common diseases and pathogens (such as tuberculosis, malaria, 
HIV, gonorrhea, MRSA, CRE and Salmonella Typhi infections) could become difficult and 
expensive to treat. Similarly, challenges with insecticide resistance continues to be on the rise in the 
region and could undermine the significant gains in the control of vector born disease such as 
malaria, dengue, and yellow fever. Detection, monitoring, and responding to AMR relies on having 
strengthened and coordinated laboratory and surveillance capacities in the region. 
 
Control of the accelerating spread of communicable diseases in West Africa is also hampered by the 
limited capacities of individual country health systems for efficient surveillance, early detection and 
rapid response to infectious disease outbreaks that result in significant reversals in human 
development progress in the region including increased cases of morbidity and mortality, threats to 
food security, and substantial economic losses. For many countries in West Africa, years of civil 
conflict and underinvestment have resulted in weak health infrastructure, periodic disruption in 
service delivery, and critical shortages or gaps in the workforce (eg. epidemiologists, laboratorians, 
information technology experts, etc.). Mitigation of the risks posed by diseases with pandemic 
potential, including emerging zoonosis, will have to address these weaknesses in country health 
systems in the region. 
 
The effectiveness of disease surveillance and response systems is currently hampered by:  
lack of appropriate plans and resources to respond to health threats in a timely manner; 
scarcity and non-retention of trained and motivated human and animal health workforce resources, 
at both central and local levels;

overall weakness of  human and animal disease information systems, including insufficient data 
collection and use of data for informing policy decisions and action, as well as for the prevention 
and mitigation of the cross-border spread of diseases; 
insufficient integration of parallel disease- specific surveillance systems;  
insufficient cross-sectorial coordination and collaboration among Ministries, in particular among 
those in charge of public health, animal health and the environment leading to inadequate 
operationalization of the “One Health” concept; 
inadequate human and animal health laboratory capacity, including inadequate specimen 
transportation networks, and low involvement of laboratories in the surveillance and response 
systems; 
disparity in detection and disease management capabilities among countries and insufficient 
regional cooperation. 
 
In June 2007, the WHO set forth a mandate via the International Health Regulation (IHR 2005) that 
requires country governments to develop, strengthen and maintain the core capacities of national 
public health systems to detect, assess, notify, and respond promptly and effectively to health risks 
and public health emergencies of international concern (PHEICs).  In the WHO Africa Region 
(WHO/AFRO), the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy serves as a 
framework to fulfill the mandates of IHR (2005). However, till today, IDSR has not been fully 
implemented in most countries in the region, thus contributing to the limited capacity of the 
countries’ health system for systematic collection, analysis, confirmation, and interpretation of 
disease surveillance data, in addition to insufficient capabilities for preparedness and rapid response. 
Thus, the need to reinforce these capacities in this region as a mitigating risk for potential future 
pandemic outbreaks. 
 
Animal Health Sector 
The animal health sector in the ECOWAS region is characterized by a high incidence and 
prevalence of many contagious diseases, both zoonotic and non-zoonotic, impacting productivity, 
public health, rural development and livelihoods. Since December 2014, West Africa has witnessed 
a reemergence of an H5N1 outbreak.  Important weaknesses in veterinary public health systems 
caused long delays in detecting, reporting and putting other necessary mitigation measures in place 
to reduce the risk of spread and to eventually eradicate the virus. Lack of preparedness, insufficient 
human, physical and financial resources, and the lack of cross-sector collaboration were highlighted 
as key factors by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Organization for 
Animal Health (OIE) in all affected countries. A recent summary of evaluations of the performance 
of Veterinary Services (PVS) done by the OIE within ECOWAS also highlighted the insufficient 
budgetary resources, and a mismatch between human resources and actual requirements.  In terms 
of strategic actions for animal health, all countries identified the need to improve the surveillance 
cover, in line with the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health code, and to control priority animal diseases 
(including through vaccination). 
 
Collaboration between Veterinary and Human Public Health Systems.  
West African countries do not have yet the requisite systems in place and are generally ill-equipped 
to prevent human infections and to mitigate the losses from exposure to diseases of animal origin. In 
addition to strengthening national veterinary and human public health systems and their regional 
cooperation, there is an urgent need to establish or reinforce and maintain strong collaboration 
between systems at national and regional levels in order to better manage risks that arise at the 
animal-human-ecosystem interface (the so called ‘One Heath’(OH) approach.). For that to happen,

particular attention will be given to priority core public functions (veterinary public health and 
human public health) that would reduce these risks. Assessing these core functions, bridging divides 
among systems and ministries and reducing capacity gaps would constitute a critical element of the 
program. Country assessment tools now exist for both systems (Performance of Veterinary Services 
pathway; IHR monitoring framework costing tool) as well as well identified bridges for OH 
competencies. Attention to building systems for core functions and policy dialogue, based on 
credible assessments, rigorous analysis and adequate financing, will ensure sustainability and reduce 
disease risks. These efforts would support specific ongoing national and regional disease-control 
initiatives, already part of system-strengthening country program, and demonstrate the performance 
of collaborative systems in disease surveillance, prevention and control.   
 
Regional Disease Surveillance and Response Network 
The recent EVD epidemic in West Africa has been attributed, not only to environmental factors and 
human behavior, but also to weaknesses in the health systems of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone 
and their inability to detect and respond swiftly to public health threats, and moreover, to the lack of 
a regional surveillance and response network in West Africa. Containment of West Africa’s EVD 
epidemic that initially began in Guinea and spread to neighboring countries was hampered by the 
absence of the systematic collection and reporting and exchange of surveillance and laboratory data 
across country-borders in real time. The EVD epidemic dramatically illustrates the need for a more 
harmonized approach to disease surveillance and response, both within countries and within the 
West Africa region overall. The EVD epidemic highly underscores the importance of regional 
cooperation among West African countries for the prevention and control of potential cross-border 
disease outbreaks, as a key component of the post-Ebola health systems recovery strategy, and 
overall health systems strengthening efforts in the region.

Relationship to CAS
The project is in line with the WB’s mission to end extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity. 
Communicable and non-communicable diseases are a major constraint on the health, education and 
potential earnings of people living in the ECOWAS region and have the greatest impact on the most 
vulnerable population.  Hence, the economic rationale for investing in these interventions is key to 
mitigating the economic burden not only on individuals but also on the country as a whole. The CPS 
for the nine countries targeted by this project emphasize the need to strengthen the capacity of 
health systems of which disease surveillance is a key pillar, in order to improve health outcomes and 
reduce vulnerability (To be updated with CPS for each country). 
 
The project complements both WBG and development partner investments in health systems 
strengthening, disease control and surveillance.  Establishing this complementarity is particularly 
important in the three countries most affected by the EVD epidemic.  For Example, in the context of 
the recent Ebola epidemic, the Government of Sierra Leone is eager to dramatically improve 
national disease surveillance and response capacity. Having experienced first-hand the devastating 
consequences of cross-border spread of Ebola, the government also acknowledges the paramount 
importance of regional disease surveillance and institutions for cross-border and inter-country 
collaboration. On 7-8 September, 2015, the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) 
and multiple partners met in Freetown to discuss the creation of a Sierra Leone's National Public 
Health Institute (NPHI). Core functions of this Institute will include surveillance and response, 
research aimed at answering important questions for policy and program design, and response to 
public health emergencies. The Government of Sierra Leone is acutely aware of its limited financial 
and technical resources and has already begun actively engaging partners to assist in the creation of

the NPHI. US CDC, China CDC and Public Health England have already demonstrated significant 
interest. The proposed project can play a vital role in providing financial and technical assistance to 
the Government of Sierra Leone to create the NPHI, can convene the multiple partners around a 
harmonized agenda, and can ensure that what is created in Sierra Leone is integrated into regional 
systems.

II. Proposed Development Objective(s)

III. Preliminary Description
Concept Description
The project's development objective (PDO) is to strengthen cross-sectoral and regional capacity for 
collaborative disease surveillance and response in West Africa. 
 
The PDO seeks to address systemic weaknesses within the animal and human health sectors that 
hinder effective disease surveillance and response by: (i) strengthening the capacity of selected 
ECOWAS member countries to fulfill their obligations under the WHO IHR (2005) and the OIE 
Terrestrial Animal Health Code; (ii) reinforcing sustainable and effective regional collaboration and 
collective action to detect and respond promptly to priority infectious diseases threats in West 
Africa including zoonotic diseases; and (iii) establishing an efficient linkage of country health 
systems to regional laboratory, surveillance, and response networks. 
 
Ultimately, the project will contribute towards significantly reducing the burden of diseases 
particularly among the poor and vulnerable populations, mitigating the public health and economic 
risks posed by infectious diseases in humans and animals, and decreasing the threats of future 
disease outbreaks thereby promoting global health security.

I. Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement  
 

Niger is predominantly a rural economy. The majority of the population and the poor earn their 

living from agriculture which is the main contributor to GDP. A key objective of the Government 

of Niger is to focus on supporting rural growth with agriculture being the leading sector of the 

rural growth strategy. The government’s priority is to increase agricultural productivity. The sector 

is handicapped by inadequate extension services,1 limited use of equipment and modern inputs, 

limited control of water, a weak organization of producers, and declines in soil fertility. Extremely 

low access to rural finance is identified as one of the key impediments to modern inputs, marketing 

channels and logistics—including inadequate storage facilities and ability to process agricultural 

products which also account for low productivity in agriculture. Strengthening of the links between 

the extractive industry and the local economy is also considered a key factor to rural growth. The 

greatest potential for the extractive industry social and economic contribution is in job creation 

either through local subcontracting and/or through the development of the informal mining sector, 

such as gold panning and small-scale mining. A framework needs to be established to formalize 

the local content in the sector and the artisanal mining sector needs to be formalized and better 

organized. Community development aimed at providing social infrastructure (roads, schools, 

hospitals, and mining cities) also enhances the benefits for the rural population. They provide an 

alternative to rural employment.

Counterfactual analyses show that significant gains could be made if inefficiencies in 

infrastructure were fixed. Niger could grow by as much as 4.5 percentage points per capita if it 

expands and improves its infrastructure. Power would contribute around 1.51 percentage points to 

per capita growth if generation capacity and national access rates—which as of today are among 

the lowest in the region—were increased. ICT would also make an important contribution to 

economic prospects (1.31 percentage points), provided the mobile phone and Internet markets 

continue expanding.2 Creating a favorable environment for the private sector to invest in these 

sectors, improving access of the rural population to electricity and mobile/internet, and making 

sure that the NIGELEC, the state-owned company in electricity, remains financially viable are the 

main objectives of the Government.    

 

One of the key challenges facing Niger is to increase tax revenue. First, it will help continue 

financing Niger’s development challenges and avoid painful fiscal consolidation through cuts in 

expenditures as has been the case in the past years. Second, the current vicious circle of increasing 

public debt and interest payments represents a risk that would only be mitigated in the medium 

term under the assumption of a tightening fiscal stance. Tax policy to broaden the base, the 

rationalization of tax exemptions and the strengthening of tax and customs administration are 

among the key features of the government’s strategy. Government data show that tax expenditures 

and exemptions from the investment code -only - increased from 0.5 percent to 0.9 percent of GDP 

between 2014 and 2015. A World Bank study showed that for customs revenues only, over the 

five years from 2011 to 2016, exemptions represented 47 percent of customs revenue, on average, 

peaking at 54 percent in 2015.3  

 

Niger’s macroeconomic framework remains adequate for the proposed operation. Niger’s 

macroeconomic framework remains adequate for the proposed operation. Growth is on an upward 

trend and expected to average 5.8 percent during 2018-21. Niger has sustained its fiscal 

consolidation policy since 2016, combining enhanced revenue policy and expenditure control 

which aims to bring Niger in line with the West African Economic and Monetary Union 

(WAEMU) fiscal target by 2021. The risk of debt distress is moderate. The macro policy 

framework is underpinned by the continued implementation of the International Monetary Fund 

(IMF) Extended Credit Facility (ECF) program and the macroeconomic anchor offered by Niger’s 

membership in the WAEMU. Downside risks predominate and are mainly related to the 

vulnerability and exposure of the economy to weather, security and commodity prices. 

 

II. Proposed Objective(s) 
 

The proposed operation is the second of a series of two development policy operations to be 

disbursed over 2017-2018 under IDA 18. The operation will provide financial support to Niger as 

the authorities implement the PDES II.   

 

The proposed series is fully aligned with the government’s development strategy and priorities as 

articulated in the PDES II.  It is designed to advance a number of key PDES II objectives. Pillar 1 

supports the PDES II ’s objective of “  by 

focusing on agricultural productivity

rural economy. 

the PDES II’s objective of “ . Pillar 3, supports the PDES 

II’s objective of “Governance, Peace and Security”.    

 

 

III. Preliminary Description 
 

The program development objective (PDO) is to foster rural growth. This will be achieved 

through a series of cross-cutting reform measures grouped in two pillars. The first pillar is 

“Increasing rural productivity growth”. It aims to (i) 

strengthen the linkages between the extractive industries 

and the local economy “Supporting 

growth-enabling sectors”. It aims to (i) develop a framework favorable to ICT investment, mainly 

in rural areas; (ii) improve the financial and the technical performance of NIGELEC4; (iii) broaden 

the tax base by rationalizing tax expenditure and exemption regimes, and (iv) create the conditions 

for sustainable rural road maintenance financing framework.  

 

IV. Poverty and Social Impacts and Environment Aspects 
 

Many of the actions supported by the proposed operation are expected to have positive poverty 

reduction and welfare enhancement impacts. Improvements in the agricultural input supply chain 

(seeds and fertilizers) and on the extension service delivery will contribute to higher agricultural 

yields and therefore to improved food security while reducing economic vulnerability of rural 

households. Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) is an important source for jobs for the rural 

population, and a way for many to complement agricultural incomes. In particular, the 

development of community projects financed by the extractive industry will impact positively the 

rural population. In addition, enforcement of existing regulation in the extractive industry will 

allow the development of a strategy to address the social, health and safety issues that are currently 

encountered in the artisanal mining areas: the child labor, the dangerous and unhealthy working 

conditions resulting in frequent accidents (collapsing tunnels and pits), the absence of adequate 

personal protective equipment. Greater access to rural finance will help producers access more 

economic opportunities.  

 

The development of the electricity and ICT sectors will create small business opportunities while 

complementing other initiatives to improve rural welfare. Potential negative impact on the poor of 

the tariff adjustment is mitigated. The majority of the poor does not have access and use electricity. 

In addition, there is already a tariff system that protects to the poor. Nonetheless, a PSIA will be 

conducted during calendar year 2018 by the NECALEP to assess the impact of the electricity 

measures and inform the government policy in the sector. Access to internet and mobile through 

the USF will allow for the expansion of e-voucher supporting social protection and subsidy 

programs targeting the poor.    

 

Some actions supported by the proposed series are expected to have a positive impact on gender

equality. The development of an action plan to better integrate Extractive Industries into the 

national economy envisages among other objectives the advancement of women in the sector. The 

formalization of the ASM will protect women and children for whom harsh working and living 

conditions are the norm The impact on gender of the prior actions on agriculture, rural finance, 

electricity and ICT will not be directly linked to the prior actions. However, their impact could 

benefit female-headed more proportionately given their more pronounced vulnerability if directed 

to hem. Increased access to electricity and broadband network is expected to benefit female-headed 

households who are more in need of new economic opportunities more proportionately. Similarly, 

the education and health reforms will allow the Government and public agencies to expand social 

services, which are critically important to women and female-headed households.  

 

Environment Aspects  

 

The proposed operation is likely to have positive effect on the Niger’s environment, forests, or 

other natural resources. Unregulated or poorly regulated artisanal mining activities in the extractive 

industries have resulted in significant environmental destruction. Such adverse impacts have been 

considered by the Government which has prepared a Strategic Environmental and Social 

Assessment (SESA) to identify and address negative (enhance positive) environmental and social 

impacts along the entire mining value chain. The SESA provides strategic guidance for enhancing 

environmental sustainability and social equity of the sector as a whole and specific 

recommendations to be incorporated into national policies and programs. The formalization of 

artisanal mining is likely to reduce such adverse impacts on the environment. Similarly, a stronger 

regulation and control of the quality of agricultural inputs will reduce potential environmental risks 

borne by unregulated seeds or fertilizers. The prior actions supporting the development of ICT, 

rural finance and the social sectors are not likely to have significant impacts on environment and 

forests

Corporate Review Decision Proceed to Appraisal/Negotiations 

 

 Country and Sector Background 
 

1. Niger’s economy is undiversified, heavily relying on agriculture and the extractive 
industries. Agriculture is main driver of growth and accounts for 40 percent of GDP. The vast 

majority of Niger’s population and the poor live in rural areas and earn their living from 

agriculture. However, agricultural productivity is low due to very low uptake of modern inputs 

and poor extension services.  Niger has significant mineral wealth, including uranium and gold, 

and has started exporting refined oil products. These three products account for approximately 70 

percent of total export values. The extractive industry accounts for 10-15 percent of government 

revenue.  

2. Growth is volatile owing to frequent external shocks of different nature. Shocks 
impacting on the economy include security challenges, the Nigerian crisis, unfavorable weather 

conditions and commodity prices. Security challenges disrupted economic activities with 

growing social and humanitarian pressures linked to the flow of hundreds of thousand refugees 

and internally-displaced people. The economic downturn in Nigeria impacted export 

performance. Unfavorable weather conditions impacted agriculture, and depressed commodity 

prices adversely affected growth and revenue in the extractive industries.       

3. Although declining, poverty remains high, and is more pronounced in rural areas. Poverty 
incidence declined from 53.7 percent in 2005 to 44.5 percent in 2014. Despite the decline in 

overall poverty incidence, the rural poor became poorer relative to their urban counterparts 

during the same period. Their per capita consumption relative to that of the urban poor declined 

from 60 percent to 43 percent. Lack of economic diversification, volatile agricultural growth,

low access to physical and institutional infrastructure, and a weak human capital base limit 

economic opportunities, especially in rural area. 

 

 Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement  
 

4. A key objective of the Government of Niger is to focus on supporting rural growth, given 
the concentration of the poor in rural areas. Agriculture would be the leading sector supported by 

the government’s 3N initiative with a special focus on agro-industry, public investment in 

infrastructure and the social sectors. Niger is predominantly a rural economy and the majority of 

the population earn their living from agriculture. Agriculture is the main contributor to GDP but 

agricultural productivity is low compared to the secondary and tertiary sectors, to other countries 

in the region.1 The sector is handicapped by inadequate extension services,2 limited use of 

equipment and modern inputs, limited control of water, a weak organization of producers, and 

declines in soil fertility. Extremely low access to rural finance is identified as one of the key 

impediments to modern inputs, marketing channels and logistics—including inadequate storage 

facilities and ability to process agricultural products which also account for low productivity in 

agriculture. Strengthening of the links between the extractive industry and the local economy is 

also considered a key factor to rural growth. The greatest potential for the extractive industry 

social and economic contribution is in job creation either through local subcontracting and/or 

through the development of the informal mining sector, such as gold panning and small-scale 

mining. A framework needs to be established to formalize the local content in the sector and the 

artisanal mining sector needs to be formalized and better organized. Community development 

aimed at providing social infrastructure (roads, schools, hospitals, and mining cities) also 

enhances the benefits for the rural population. They provide an alternative to rural employment.  

5. Counterfactual analyses show that significant gains could be made if inefficiencies in 
infrastructure were fixed. Niger could grow by as much as 4.5 percentage points per capita if it 

expands and improves its infrastructure. Power would contribute around 1.51 percentage points 

to per capita growth if generation capacity and national access rates—which as of today are 

among the lowest in the region—were increased. ICT would also make an important contribution 

to economic prospects (1.31 percentage points), provided the mobile phone and Internet markets 

continue expanding.3 Creating a favorable environment for the private sector to invest in these 

sectors, improving access of the rural population to electricity and mobile/internet, and making 

sure that the NIGELEC, the state-owned company in electricity, remains financially viable are 

the main objectives of the Government.    

6. Niger’s domestic revenue is low, and is among the lowest in the WAEMU. One of the 
key challenges facing Niger is the need for increasing its tax revenue. First it will help continue 

financing Niger’s development challenges and avoid painful fiscal consolidation through cuts in 

expenditures as has been the case in the past years. Second, the current vicious circle of 

increasing public debt and interest payments represents a risk that would only be mitigated in the 

medium term under the assumption of a tightening fiscal stance. Government data show that tax

expenditures and exemptions from the investment code -only - increased from 0.5 percent to 0.9 

percent of GDP between 2014 and 2015. A World Bank study showed that for customs revenues 

only, over the five years from 2011 to 2016, exemptions represented 47 percent of customs 

revenue, on average, peaking at 54 percent in 2015.4  

7. Niger’s macroeconomic framework remains adequate for the proposed operation. Growth 
is expected to be moderate averaging 4.5-5 percent in 2017-19 driven by agriculture and mining. 

To contain the substantial fiscal deficit of 7.5 percent in 2017, explained partly by security-

related spending, the government has initiated a process of fiscal consolidation which aims to 

bring Niger in line with the WAEMU fiscal target by 2020. The tax revenue measures included 

in this programmatic series support this consolidation effort.  This risk of debt distress is 

moderate. The macro policy framework is underpinned by the continued implementation of the 

International Monetary Fund (IMF) Extended Credit Facility (ECF) program and the 

macroeconomic anchor offered by Niger’s membership in the West African Economic and 

Monetary Union (WAEMU). Downside risks predominate and are mainly related to the 

vulnerability and exposure of the economy to weather, security, Nigeria’s economy and 

commodity prices. 

 

 Proposed Objective 
 

8. The proposed operation is the first of a series of two development policy operations to be 
disbursed over 2017-2018 under IDA 18. The operation will provide financial support to Niger 

as the authorities implement the (Plan de Développement Economique et Social) PDES II .   

9. The proposed series is fully aligned with the government’s development strategy and 
priorities as articulated in the PDES II.  It is designed to advance a number of key PDES II 

objectives. Pillar 1 supports the PDES II ’s objective of “Food security and sustainable 

agricultural development” by focusing on agricultural productivity and the dissemination of 

context-relevant farming practices. The focus on the extractive industry in Pillar 1 supports the 

PDES II’s objective of “A competitive and diversified economy” by strengthening the linkages 

between the extractive industries with the rural economy. The focus on rural finance under Pillar 

1 and infrastructure under Pillar 2 supports the PDES II’s objective of “A competitive and 

diversified economy”. Pillar 3, supports the PDES II’s objective of “Governance, Peace and 

Security”.    

 

 Preliminary Description 
 

10. The program development objective (PDO) is to foster rural growth. This will be 
achieved through a series of cross-cutting reform measures grouped in two pillars. The first pillar 

is “Increasing rural productivity growth”. It aims to (i) enhance the use of modern inputs and 

improve access to extension services systems; (ii) strengthen the linkages between the extractive 

industries and the local economy, and; (iii) deepen rural finance penetration. The second pillar is 

“Supporting growth-enabling sectors”. It aims to (i) develop a framework favorable to ICT

1.  The Republic of Angola is still recovering from a turbulent past despite oil and mineral wealth. 
With approximately 25.8 million inhabitants,  it is the seventh most populated country in Africa. 
Angola is one of the largest oil exporters in the region, and is rich in diamonds and other mineral 
resources. Angola became independent from Portugal in 1975, but was then engulfed in a 27-year 
civil conflict, which ended with a peace accord in 2002. Despite the country➢❨ s upper-middle 
income status with GDP per capita of US$5,400 in 2014, poverty remains pervasive with 30.1 
percent of the population living below the international poverty line in 2008. 
 
2.     Propelled by the end of the civil conflict and the expansion of the oil sector, the Angolan 
economy posted an average growth rate of 12.5 percent between 2004 and 2008. This period of 
high growth was interrupted by the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Following a slowdown 
between 2009 and 2011, when GDP grew at 2.5 percent on average, fast growth resumed in 2012 
(7.6 percent). 
 
3.  Limited progress was made in improving social indicators during the oil boom years. Angola's 
remarkable growth has not been equally shared. Large parts of the population lack access to basic 
services. Life expectancy is 52.3 years and the country ranks 149th out of 188 in the Human 
Development Index. Income inequality is high and marked disparities in regional and urban/rural 
poverty persist. More than half of Angola➢❨ s poor are located in rural areas and depend almost 
exclusively on agriculture for their livelihood. Among the most vulnerable groups in the country 
are women-headed agriculture households, which represent 33 percent of agriculture households. 
 
4.  Angola is experiencing a major macroeconomic shock due to the dramatic oil price drop since 
2014. This is not surprising as oil represents about 30 percent of GDP, over 95 percent of export 
earnings, and 75 percent of government revenue. The country faces a scarcity of foreign exchange 
(FX), fiscal and external deficits, higher inflation and weakened economic activity. The impact on 
households are considerable. Lower government expenditures and a reduced public sector wage 
bill have resulted in reduced private consumption, compounded by the elimination of fuel 
subsidies. Because of the crisis, GDP growth is forecasted at just 0.9 percent in 2016, followed by 
a rebound of about 3 percent in 2017 . 
 
5. The government has implemented bold fiscal measures since mid-2015 to address the effects of 
the oil price drop, but challenges remain on the monetary front. A revised budget was adopted in 
March 2015 to reflect the major shortfall in revenue, with oil prices dropping from US$80 in the 
initial budget to US$40. The government cut capital expenditure by nearly half, and significantly 
reduced fuel subsidies. The Strategy to Exit the Crisis brought further fiscal consolidation 
measures such as the institution of a new tax on financial transactions and the cancellation of 
double payments to former combatants. The adjustment however has not progressed much on the 
monetary and external sector. Although interest rates have risen and the currency has devalued, 
inflation reached 29.2 percent in May and the spread between the official and parallel exchange 
rate has more than doubled. Imports have been contained and international reserves have been 
kept high due to strong administrative controls on access to foreign exchange (FX). As a result, 
companies are postponing investments and reducing production because they cannot import the 
inputs needed. 
 
6. Despite recent reforms, Angola➢❨ s investment climate remains challenging. The country 
underperforms in competitiveness, business environment, and governance rankings. For example, 
the World Economic Forum➢❨ s Global Competitiveness Report (GCR) 2014-2015 ranked

Angola 140th out of 144 economies while the country ranks 181st out of 189 economies in the 
Doing Business 2016 report, suggesting a complex regulatory environment. Angola lags other 
Sub-Saharan Africa countries in the 2015 Worldwide Governance Indicators. Recent reforms 
include a reduction in the costs and requirements to start a business, a new Labor Code, and an 
overhaul of investment policy. Other efforts are underway to modernize tax and customs 
administration, and the justice sector. Well implemented, they could contribute to a more 
effective and transparent government interaction with the private sector. However, institutional 
weaknesses and governance issues defy reform implementation. Overall, Angola➢❨ s business 
environment is characterized by cumbersome regulations, constrained competition and 
considerable government presence in economic activity. Limited access to finance, poor 
infrastructure, weak workforce skills and corruption are the main constraints mentioned by firms. 
 
7. Diversifying the economy away from oil is an urgent priority and part of the Government➢❨ s 
response to the oil price crisis. Dependency on oil leaves Angola vulnerable to price and 
production shocks. For years, an overvalued exchange rate contributed to reduce the 
competitiveness of the non-oil sectors. The government crisis response strategy, presented in 
February 2016, aims at reducing the reliance on oil to generate revenues, substitute imports and 
promote non-traditional exports. Agricultural production plays a large role in the government➢❨  
strategy. Diversifying the economy will require economic transformation and eliminating 
obstacles to private investment, as well as efficient use of government resources to address 
infrastructure bottlenecks, and invest in human capital.
Sectoral and Institutional Context
8.  Angola➢❨ s agriculture potential remains largely untapped. The country has an abundance of 
land, water, and diversity of climatic and soil conditions for the production of a large variety of 
crops, but only 8 percent of its 58 million hectares of arable land is currently cultivated .  The 
agricultural sector in Angola currently represents around 5 percent of GDP, compared to 57.7 
percent for industry, including extractive, and 37.7 percent for services, and could contribute 
more to employment creation, especially for the youth. Nonetheless, agriculture is the main 
source of income for 90 percent of the 8.5 million Angolans living in rural areas (about 37 percent 
of the population). 
 
9.  Once a large exporter of coffee, cotton, sisal, sugar cane, bananas and tobacco, Angola➢❨ s 
agriculture sector suffered widespread destruction during the conflict and has not fully recovered 
since. Before the war the country was self-sufficient in all food crops except wheat. The exodus 
of Portuguese settlers after independence and the ensuing civil war that ravaged the country 
meant the loss of technical capacity and infrastructure destruction, cutting production areas from 
markets. Roads, bridges and other rural infrastructure were largely destroyed. Large-scale 
population displacement in rural areas and land mines➢❨ as many as 10 million➢❨ further 
constrained the sector recovery.  
 
10.  Production has been growing in recent years and the country has reached self-sufficiency in 
sweet potatoes and manioc, but Angola still relies on imports for most of its food consumption 
needs. For example, locally produced chicken supply only 40 percent of the local demand and 
production is limited by the lack of feed. In general, Angola has greater opportunities to compete 
with imports of perishable goods, including fruits, vegetables, and eggs, and local production of 
these goods has increased in recent years. Statistics on agriculture production are unreliable and 
outdated, but should improve with the planned agricultural census. According to MINAGRI 
2013/2014 production data, major crops based on volume include sweet potatoes, cassava,

bananas, maize, pineapples, citrus fruits, beans, peanuts, and tomatoes. Agriculture exports 
represent less than 0.8 percent of total exports. Excluding fish, where little value is added in 
country, agriculture exports amount to just US$3.5 million. Coffee accounts for 43 percent, 
followed by non-alcoholic beverages (32 percent), beer (9 percent), fruit juice (5 percent) and 
medicinal plants (3 percent). The country is slowly opening new export markets including to 
neighboring DRC. It recently restarted exporting bananas to Portugal, 42 years later, with a 
shipment of 17 tons.  
 
11. Smallholders represent over 80 percent of agriculture production and 92 percent of land under 
cultivation. A small but growing formal distribution sector is establishing partnerships with local 
producers to ensure quality supply of primarily fresh produce. Still, most agriculture production is 
used for self-consumption or sold through informal channels. 
 
12. Macroeconomic conditions and the business climate constrain private investment in 
agriculture. An overvalued exchange rate in recent years and the current scarcity of foreign 
exchange affect the sector competitiveness and hamper private investment. The challenging 
business environment, including high cost of doing business, uncompetitive input markets, and 
insecurity of land tenure, as well as government crowding out the private sector, further reduce 
the sector➢❨ s attractiveness to private investors. However, based on discussions with private 
operators, investment opportunities exist in the production and processing for products such as 
horticulture, grains and beans, poultry and livestock, as well as aquaculture. While foreign 
exchange shortages are resulting in some of these investments being put on hold, they could 
materialize once macroeconomic conditions improve. New investment could bring much needed 
capital and know-how to the commercial agriculture sector. 
 
13. Access to finance is a serious hindrance to commercial agricultural development. 
Notwithstanding the high credit growth from 2004 to 2014 (going from 5 percent to 22 percent of 
GDP), the share of credit going to agriculture has remained very low at less than 5 percent of 
overall credit provided. Additionally, despite the general increase in access to finance over the 
five years between 2010 and 2014 (with an increase of two-thirds of branches, doubling of ATMs, 
and tripling of Points of Sale), there has been a clear urban/rural divide in access with Luanda 
accounting for the bulk of financial sector outreach. Specifically, Luanda, which has 27 percent of 
the population, accounted for 83 percent of credit, 94 percent of deposits and the majority of bank 
branches, ATMs and POS in 2015. Government programs such as the Angola Investe, offer 
subsidized credit, guarantees and a public risk capital fund, however most supported projects 
belong to non-agribusiness sectors and tend to be concentrated in Luanda. The Angola 
Development Bank also offers some lines of credit to the agriculture sector. Finally, the enabling 
environment for promoting agriculture finance (including agriculture insurance, warehouse 
receipts, equipment leasing, moveable collateral registry) is yet to be developed. 
 
14.  Infrastructure weaknesses hinder the creation of value addition through processing, and the 
integration of small producers into value chains. Market linkages are constrained by poor road 
and storage infrastructure. The total road network is about 76,000 km, many in need for 
rehabilitation, and the road density is 6 km /100 kmÂ², one of the lowest in Southern Africa. The 
rural access index is 42 percent, which is the fourth lowest in the world after South-Sudan, Chad 
and Mali (WDI). Although the government has heavily invested in improving the transport 
network over the last decade, including road and railways, limited budget is available for rural 
roads. Moreover, the limited reach of the electricity grid and the high cost of operating generators

hamper the competitiveness of agribusiness, including agro-processing, irrigated agriculture, and 
livestock. The sector also suffers from lack of other adequate dedicated public services and 
infrastructure, such as phytosanitary and quality systems and commercial infrastructure. 
 
15.   Lack of technical knowledge and access to inputs further constrain commercial agriculture 
development. Poor agronomic practices, limited use of improved seeds, fertilizers, and irrigation 
technology, undermine productivity, growth and diversification. Most agricultural inputs, 
including fertilizers and machinery, are imported at high cost, and remain out of reach of small 
producers. These shortcomings are compounded by the very low technical capacity all along the 
value chain. 
 
16. Responsibility for agriculture policy and program development falls under the Ministry of 
Agriculture (MINAGRI). The Ministry is represented at the provincial level by the Provincial 
Directorates of Agriculture (DPA), and at the municipal level by the EstaÃ§Ã£o de 
Desenvolvimento AgrÃ¡rio (EDAs). MINAGRI➢❨ s capacity for program design and 
implementation has room for significant improvement. The World Bank Market Oriented 
Smallholder Agriculture Project (MOSAP), which closed in March 2016, and its follow up 
Smallholder Agriculture Development and Commercialization Project (SADCP), approved by the 
Board of Directors on July 5, 2016, include activities to strengthen MINAGRI➢❨ s capacity at the 
local, provincial and national levels. This project will build on and complement these efforts. 
 
17.   Other Government agencies are involved in the development of the agribusiness sector. 
These include the Ministry of Economy, which manages the Angola Investe program to provide 
subsidized credit to productive investments, the Angola Development Bank, the Ministry of 
Commerce and Industry, which is in charge of investment promotion (through APIEX) and  the 
agriculture commercialization program (PAPAGRO). Other relevant agencies include the 
Ministry of Construction (for road construction), Ministry of Transport, and Ministry of Energy 
and Water. The coordination among the various Government agencies in the implementation of 
complex multisectoral projects to support agribusiness development needs substantial 
strengthening. This is hindered by limited technical capacity and a centralized approach to 
decision-making. 
 
18.  In an effort to spur commercial agriculture, the government has invested in spatial approaches 
and infrastructure development. Government-sponsored projects range from integrated socio-
economic projects, following Israel➢❨ s Kibutz model (Aldeia Nova) to large-scale agro-
industrial poles such as the 400,000 ha Capanda development pole, as well as irrigated perimeters 
with plots for large, medium and small-scale producers. These projects are often financed by 
foreign lines of credit, and management is frequently contracted out to foreign firms, which bring 
the technology and know-how to run them. A state owned company, Gesterra, sponsors many of 
these projects. While some of these projects have achieved productivity close to international 
good practices , others are still not operational or have failed to attract private producers (e.g. 
Family Aviculture Project). Overall, the financial and economic viability of these projects on a 
purely commercial basis needs to be confirmed. Other government investments include 
distribution centers and cold storage, some of which remain underutilized. Support infrastructure 
is still insufficient and existing facilities need to be more effectively used. 
 
19.  Low and declining public spending in agriculture highlights the need for mobilizing private 
investment. The share of agriculture in the national budget declined from 1.10 percent in 2013

(US$701.76 million) to 0.41 percent (US$543.9 million) in 2015. In the current constrained fiscal 
environment, there is a need to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public expenditures to 
develop strategic infrastructure, strengthen institutional capacity and improve research and 
extension services, and support smallholders. More efforts are needed to attract private 
investment and promote public-private partnerships under transparent criteria. The Commercial 
Agriculture Development project will contribute to these goals. 
 
20.  Weak public sector governance and poor capacity have considerably limited agriculture 
development efforts in the past. These issues affect resource allocation across a range of key areas 
in the agriculture sector, from access to land to financing of irrigation, agricultural infrastructure, 
and inputs. For example, one bottleneck for investment in agriculture is secured land access: land 
allocation procedures and coexistence of several legal systems for recognition and governance of 
land rights in Angola (state law and traditional rights) weaken legal certainty and hinder the 
sector➢❨ s development. To attract transformative private investments in the agriculture sector, 
particular attention will need to be paid to: (i) legal and regulatory measures; (ii) institutional 
mechanisms and delivery platforms; and (iii) transparency and social accountability. Besides 
involving several agencies/departments within the Ministry of Agriculture, the Project will need 
to work closely with, and reinforce the capacities of, several public institutions that have critical 
influence on agricultural investment generation.
Relationship to CAS/CPS/CPF
21. Supporting integrated national economic diversification is one of the pillars in the Country 
Partnership Strategy (CPS) FY14-16. Development of the agriculture sector, through productivity 
increases and market linkages, is seen as an important source of growth, employment creation and 
poverty reduction. Making progress toward the twin goals is found to be feasible building on the 
adoption of pro-poor growth strategies and policies. The draft Performance and Learning Review 
(PLR) envisions an extension of the CPS until FY18 and a reformulation of the objectives to 
respond to the macroeconomic challenges emerging from the oil price drop. The draft PLR 
maintains economic diversification as one of the key objectives of the CPS. A specific outcome 
related to enhancing productivity and competitiveness in the agriculture sector has been proposed, 
which is directly related to the activities of this project. 
 
22.  This Project will also build synergies with other World Bank Group projects, such as the 
Smallholder Agriculture Development and Commercialization Project (SACDP, P154447) and 
Angola Statistics Project (P157671). Close coordination between the IFC and the Bank (IBRD) 
will play an important role to mobilize investment, sector financing and PPPs, where each 
institution will contribute on the basis of its respective mandates. 
 
23.  Economic diversification and the development of commercial agriculture are critical 
priorities for the government, as outlined in the National Development Plan (NDP) 2013-2017. 
The National Development Plan seeks to promote an enlargement of the productive base to 
increase employment, leveraging the country➢❨ s natural and human resources. It underscores the 
role of the private sector as the engine of economic growth, with the public sector playing a 
leveraging role. For the agriculture sector, the NDP objective is to achieve sustainable 
development building on the country➢❨ s natural resources and competitive advantage to ensure 
food security and self-sufficiency, as well as maximizing regional and international market 
opportunities. Developing a competitive agriculture sector, with increased private investment and 
market linkages for smallholders is an objective that will be supported by the activities of this 
project. The project also contributes to the objectives of Angola➢❨ s Medium Term Agriculture

Development Plan 2013-2017, which seeks to foster agricultural and rural transformation, based 
on the development of smallholder agriculture, cooperatives and public-private partnerships, as 
well as contribute to the country➢❨ s industrialization.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
24.  The proposed project development objective (PDO) is to promote commercial agriculture 
development, increasing production and employment within selected value chains, in targeted 
areas in Angola.

Key Results (From PCN)
25.  The project strategy to achieve the PDO is to support the transformation of Angola➢❨ s 
agriculture towards a greater role for the private sector, building on existing programs, and 
focusing on value chains with the largest growth and employment creation potential. More private 
investment in agriculture is needed to increase production, productivity and commercialization, 
and to help create employment opportunities for the Angolan poor. This will be achieved by 
identifying and helping prepare Private-Public Partnerships (PPPs) ➢❨  private investment 
opportunities in selected value chains, and providing support to Small and Medium Enterprises 
(SMEs), including cooperatives, and producer organizations, in those value chains to increase 
their production, productivity and linkages with larger firms. In order to create the conditions for 
private investment the project will support investments in supporting infrastructure, as well as 
improvements in the regulatory environment and government capacity to play a catalytic role for 
the commercial agriculture sector development. 
 
26.  Success in achieving the PDO will be measured by the following PDO-level indicators: (i) 
increased investment in dollar terms; (ii) support infrastructure constructed or rehabilitated by the 
project; and (iii) jobs created in the beneficiary firms. 
 
27.  External factors may affect the realization of the PDO: (i) evolution of international markets 
(e.g., commodities prices, growth, and external financing), (ii) security and/or disease outbreak in 
Angola, and (iii) global warming, that may worsen droughts and lead to severe floods.

D.  Concept Description

28.  The overall approach is to foster commercial agriculture  through a set of integrated 
investments in hard and soft infrastructure, and developing an enabling environment for private 
participation in the sector. By simultaneously intervening along multiple dimensions, the project 
aims to remove key constraints to business formation and strengthen the platform for growth in 
high-potential value chains. World Bank support is required first to identify and prioritize these 
investments; and to develop the capacity to procure them and manage their execution. The project 
will also seek to mobilize private funds for the sector through PPPs and targeted investment 
promotion. At the same time, the project will support activities to create more conducive 
conditions for the future development of commercial agriculture, including regulatory reforms, 
and strengthening of research capacity. Strong coordination among the government agencies 
involved (agriculture, transport, energy, commerce, etc.) and building a constituency for the 
project among public, private and non-governmental stakeholders will be necessary, as suggested 
by previous experience in supporting integrated interventions along agriculture value chains.

29.  Initially, two value chains will be supported and this would be scaled up during the life of the 
project to a maximum of five. Criteria for selecting value chains will be based on the 
competitiveness of specific value chain segments, potential impact (on jobs, food production, 
export diversification, and opportunities for upgrading), and readiness (existing production, 
necessary investments, and sector organization). Identifying competitive value chains in Angola 
will require a more in-depth analysis of demand, current cost structure and existing constraints. 
Two initial value chains will be selected during preparation, in consultation with the Government 
and private sector stakeholders. Existing studies of priority value chains for the Government, 
including horticulture, livestock, chicken and dairy, and by extension maize and soy, provide 
limited analysis on existing cost structures to assess their competitiveness. Preliminary work on 
the poultry sector inspired by the value chain segmentation methodology identified opportunities 
for competitive production of fresh chicken to supply the local market, provided reliable supply of 
local feed can be secured (see Annex 3). The Government has requested initial focus on poultry 
and by extension maize/soy as a priority due to growing demand, recent growth and the large 
share of chicken in the country➢❨ s imports. Support to export-oriented value chains, such as 
coffee, another government priority, also requires careful consideration of the competitiveness of 
Angola vis-➃❫ -vis other countries. Analytical work supported by the project will inform public-
private dialogue to agree on priority subsectors and constraints. The experience and capacity 
developed by the project will enable supporting other value chains in the future. 
 
30. The project will be geographically concentrated in the areas (to be defined during 
preparation), with the highest agricultural potential to meet domestic consumption (as would be 
the case for example in the poultry/maize/soy value chain) and export (e.g. coffee value chain). 
Other factors to select geographic areas include having a critical mass of potential commercially 
oriented producers, and access to downstream value chain activities and markets through 
proximity to agrologistical networks and platforms. 
 
31.  Moreover, the proposed project will ensure that: (1) equal opportunities and support will be 
provided to women➢❨ s and youth groups to participate in several aspects of the project; (2) 
training in gender awareness will be provided using appropriate media, language and gender-
sensitive approaches and methods; and (3) a gender informed M&E system will be implemented, 
will collect and present gender-disaggregated data on project beneficiaries. 
 
32. Given the institutional weaknesses, governance, and other risks, a flexible and modular design 
is called for. The project must remain flexible to potential delays in specific components, 
changing implementation realities, and to the response of private sector supply and demand. It 
should allow subcomponents to be removed or amended without compromising the overall 
project framework and the causal chain of activities.  Starting with a focus on existing investment 
opportunities and just two value chains will help test the approach while striving to deliver results 
early on in the project. In parallel, efforts to build client project implementation capacity and to 
improve the enabling environment will start.  Once key conditions   are established, such as: (i) 
progress in business environment reforms, PPD, analytical and implementation capacity (ii) 
selected area and pilot value chains under implementation, in compliance with all activities 
planned for the first two years of the project life, work on other value chain will be undertaken (to 
be defined during preparation). Therefore, the proposed time for the project implementation is 6 
years. 
 
33.  With an amount of $230 million,  the project will support commercial agriculture

development through three interrelated components: (1) Agribusiness development by means of 
mobilizing investment, including PPPs, providing financial and non-financial support to value 
chain actors and developing support infrastructure (rural roads, storage, irrigation, and energy); 
(2) Support to create an enabling environment for commercial agriculture; and (3) Project 
management, coordination, and public-private dialogue. 
 
34.  Component 1 ➢❨  Agribusiness Development (US$ 190 million). This Component will 
address the following challenges: (i) underinvestment by SMEs in inputs, technology and skills 
development due to access to credit constraints and information failures; (ii) insufficient linkages 
among value chain actors due to coordination and information failures and (iii) underprovision of 
infrastructure oriented to underpin market-oriented agriculture. This component aims to mobilize 
investments in agribusiness and support improvements in productivity, quality assurance and 
market linkages through the following subcomponents: 
 
35. Subcomponent 1.1 Technical and financial support to SMEs development.  This 
subcomponent will have a value chain focus and will aim to (i) support SME development, 
including market-ready producer groups and cooperatives, and help them overcome constraints in 
access to credit and managerial/technical knowledge; and (ii) support links and partnerships 
between large, medium and small-scale producers and purchasers through business alliances. As a 
result of project investments, enhanced capabilities and links to larger firms, it is expected that 
SMEs will be able to grow their business, improve productivity and quality, strengthen market 
connections, and create jobs. An important aspect during preparation will be to assess the actual 
size of the SME sector in the pilot value chains and adapt the intervention design to uptake, 
capacity, and sustainability considerations. 
 
(a) This subcomponent will provide support through a competitive  matching grant facility: 
 
1. Provision of technical assistance for pre-investments. This window will provide financial 
resources for the development of innovative business and linkages between small producers and 
other actors along the value chain. 
 
The competitive grant will provide ➢❨ startup➢❨  capital for promoting the introduction of new 
sustainable practices and technologies, and processes that improve the competitiveness of 
agricultural production by SMEs. The grant will consider three main levels of support to be 
further defined during preparation. These could include: (i) extension and technology 
development; (ii) studies for business alliances, including the formulation of business plans and 
associated productive subprojects and pilots➢❨  investments; and (iii) capacity building for 
entrepreneurs, individually or as member of a formal group (e.g. associations, cooperatives, 
farmer organizations).  
 
2. Establish a Matching Grant facility for Value Chain Development.  . This window will 
finance investments based on the business plans directly linked to the selected value chains and 
will have a geographical focus.  
 
SMEs investments will be identified through a competitive process based on a review of feasible 
business plans and selected proposals identifying SMEs financial contribution through a matching 
grant (at least 60% of total investment, to be confirmed during preparation), and presenting social 
environmental and economic sustainability analysis.

The grant will combine innovation with a focus on partnerships with the market and will consider 
to implement investments designed based on business plans agreed with their business partners. 
The objective of each proposal would be to reach the product specifications (quantity, quality, 
delivery, etc.) agreed and established in the business plan. Eligible activities that would be 
financed could include expenditures at the level of both individual producers and their 
organizations (e.g. cooperatives), such as: (i) minor on-farm infrastructure and working capital, 
(ii) technical assistance services, (iii) agriculture inputs, equipment, production facilities 
(nurseries, greenhouses), (iv) value addition investments (post-harvest processing and storage, 
packaging), soil and water conservation measures and (v) other minor infrastructure, e.g. off-farm 
infrastructure for storage specific to the needs of the business alliance. If needed, the project will 
provide additional training to improve their governance, organizational, managerial, business and 
risk-management skills and to facilitate adoption of good agricultural and environmental 
practices.  
 
Eligible applicants would include: (i) organized producer organizations associations and related 
farmers organizations with developed or developing linkages to agricultural value chains, and 
supporting the development of smallholder farmers; (ii) agribusinesses linked with smallholders, 
involved in processing, trading, and marketing of agricultural and food products/commodities 
which help to improve the growth and competitiveness of smallholder farmers either directly to 
farmers at the production stage, or further down the value chain as part of the processing chain of 
agricultural commodities; (iii) input suppliers; (iv) nucleus commercial farms working with 
smallholders; and (v) publicly and privately funded agricultural and industrial institutions and 
trusts.   
 
In addition, for mobilizing business alliance investments, the project will carry out a differentiated 
communication and dissemination campaigns to: (i) inform potential stakeholders about the scope 
and rules of the Project; (ii) the publication and dissemination of Project activities including, inter 
alia, information on demand, approvals, procurement and results; and (iii) promote investments 
and contract farming/buying contracts in agricultural sector value chains.  
 
 (b) This subcomponent will also provide support to mobilize and select larger private investors. 
 
1. Selected interventions will need to demonstrate (i) alignment with the value chain development 
and (ii) potential impact on job creation. The stakeholders jointly with the PIU will develop 
proposals to request select interventions that are not firm-specific but that benefit their segment of 
the value chain and the value chain as a whole (i.e. common goods). 
 
2. Following the Client➢❨ s and the Chamber of Commerce➢❨ s advice, the investors will need 
to be strongly involved in crafting these proposals for interventions to ensure their commitment 
aspect and consistency with the constraints faced by groups of firms in the VC. The project will 
support the creation of a national committee composed of public and private sector stakeholders 
that will be in charge of reviewing the requests for funds to finance catalytic activities, ensuring 
that they conform with the strict eligibility criteria that will be imposed (e.g. demonstrate direct 
contribution to the VC➢❨ s development and job creation) and selecting the best proposals that 
receive project support. 
 
36.  Subcomponent 1.3. Establish a Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG) fund to promote access to

credit for the project target groups. The fund is expected to lower the risk exposure of financial 
institutions through a PCG arrangement and thus increase the incentives for financing agricultural 
activities. The fund would target the agribusiness SMEs in the selected value chains for their 
financing needs whether these are for fixed assets or for working capital. It would therefore 
support matching grants beneficiaries to provide the contribution required to benefit from the 
matching grants. It is anticipated that the project PCG fund will utilize the existing structure 
established by the Angola Investe Program. However, a dedicated Fund for commercial 
agriculture will be created and will be governed in accordance with applicable Bank Group➢❨ s 
policies and the recently issued Principles for Public Credit Guarantee Schemes for MSME, with 
IFC support. For participating banks wishing to benefit from the guarantee coverage, a 
prequalification process will be undertaken.  
 
Financial institution eligibility criteria will be transparent and open to all institutions that have an 
interest to lend to the beneficiaries of the Project.  The PCG will cover 50 percent of the risk pari-
pasu for loans to and it will be priced to cover the administration costs and risks it covers. 
However, the PCG fees would be priced, so that the facility would remain sustainable after the 
project conclusion and would continue to serve this market segment following project conclusion. 
 
37. Eligibility criteria and selection processes for investment support may vary according to the 
type of support required, and will be detailed during the preparation phase and described in the 
Project Appraisal Document (PAD). 
 
38. Subcomponent 1.3. Develop critical infrastructure. This subcomponent aims to (i) address 
existing gaps in infrastructure (rural roads, post-harvest facilities, irrigation, and energy); (ii) 
strengthening the capacity of public agencies to formulate, prepare and promote medium and 
long-term public-private partnerships in the sector. Special focus will be given to the promotion 
of climate smart agriculture approaches and renewable energy technologies. 
 
39. This subcomponent will support infrastructure investments in selected value chains and 
geographic areas of focus. It will leverage existing transport, logistics, energy, and irrigation 
infrastructures to support improvements in agriculture production and productivity, reduce post-
harvest losses, and connect production areas with markets: 
 
- Construction and rehabilitation of feeder roads. Once geographic areas of focus have been 
identified during preparation, a mapping will be conducted of existing road links and current gaps 
between production areas and the main national road networks (for example, the Luanda-Malanje 
corridor for the poultry/maize/soy value chain). Maximum length of rural roads supported by the 
project will be no more than 50 km to the main road (to be confirmed during preparation). The 
project will build on the existing Strategic Plan for the Rehabilitation of Tertiary Roads and the 
National Integrated Plan for Accessibility, Mobility and Transport (PENAMT) by the Ministry of 
Transport. 
 
- Post-harvest facilities: support to landing docks infrastructure and rehabilitation/construction of 
storage facilities to facilitate collection of production. 
- Irrigation infrastructure: support to irrigation infrastructure including water storage facilities and 
main canals will be agreed during preparation. Private investors will finance the construction of 
secondary canals to their farms.

- Energy investments will be further explored during preparation phase, depending on 
confirmation of targeted value chains and the degree of electrification of the selected geographic 
areas of focus. Other sources of clean energy will also be explored. 
 
40.  This subcomponent will also support the identification and assessment of existing 
government storage and agro-industrial infrastructure amenable to private sector participation, as 
well as other rural infrastructure and agribusiness services that could advantageously be 
developed and implemented by private entities as PPP or as purely private investment. Whenever 
the local conditions so require, opportunities for the use of PPPs for the integrated development 
and management of rural facilities and services should be identified, particularly when those 
facilities and services are apt to be co-funded by commercial and individual users. Following that 
initial assessment, the project will support pre-feasibility studies for the 3-4 most promising 
opportunities to enable the government to decide whether to move ahead with a PPP. This 
subcomponent can also provide support to strengthen the legal framework for PPPs in Angola and 
support capacity building efforts in this area. This would be done not as an isolated effort, but in 
order to guarantee an adequate environment for private investment, and conditions for effective 
definition of incentives for private investors to implement the government➢❨ s agricultural 
policy. 
 
41.  Component 2 ➢❨  Support to develop an enabling environment for commercial agriculture 
(US$ 25 million). This component will focus on addressing challenges related to (i) existing gaps 
in the Government strategy for commercial agriculture development and analytical capacity; (ii) 
limited government investment generation capacity (iii) constraints in the agriculture input 
markets; (iv) high costs and uncertainty of doing business, related to burdensome regulations and 
procedures; and (iv) weaknesses in the agriculture research and development capacity. The 
component will focus on strengthening the building blocks for creating a competitive commercial 
agriculture sector, including strategy and regulatory reforms, as well as support to enhance 
research and development (R&D) for the sector. 
 
42.  Subcomponent 2.1 Support sector strategy development and enhance client analytical 
capacity. This subcomponent will contribute to strengthen institutional capacity at MINAGRI to 
develop strategies for competitive and sustainable agriculture value chain development based on 
analysis of local, regional and global demand and existing competitive advantage. By doing so, it 
will complement envisioned support by SADCP to strengthen the capacity of local, provincial, 
and national units of the Ministry of Agriculture to provide services to smallholders in the areas 
of irrigation, extension, market information, statistics and policy analysis. Specific areas of 
support will be defined during preparation, but may include: (i) capacity building for evidence-
based economic research, value chain segmentation analysis, and M&E; and (ii) technical 
assistance to develop Climate Smart Agriculture Country Profile .  It could be an important 
mechanism to build awareness of country options, facilitate dialogue, and help prioritize 
investments to deliver on the ➢❨ triple win➢❨ , implementing agriculture and food production 
practices that not only boost productivity but also enhance resilience and lower greenhouse gas 
emissions, the three pillars that form the basis of climate smart agriculture. 
 
In order to support the thinking on Government strategy, the project preparation advance will 
fund the organization of a practitioners➢❨  forum on international experiences, including 
successes and failures, in developing commercial agriculture with a special focus on value chain 
approaches and agroindustrial poles.

43.  As part of this component, the project will also support the establishment of a team of 
analysts at MINAGRI with strong skills in economic and market analysis. They will be in charge 
of reviewing and validating the outputs of consultants hired previously by the Government, and in 
assessing the experience of failed prior agribusiness initiatives. They will receive training on 
value chain segmentation methodology and will conduct additional analysis as needed to identify 
the most promising value chain segments for Angola and the existing binding constraints for their 
development. This analysis will inform the discussions in the public-private dialogue platform 
(Component 3). The team will formulate proposals for addressing such constraints in 
collaboration with the relevant government agencies. This activity will be developed in 
coordination with other Government efforts to develop skills to support economic diversification 
strategies. 
 
44.  Subcomponent 2.2 Promote investment opportunities. This subcomponent will work with the 
recently established Agency for Investment and Export Promotion (APIEX) and MINAGRI➢❨ s 
Technical Unit for Investment Promotion to strengthen investment promotion, facilitation and 
aftercare in agribusiness. In particular, the project will support the compilation of a pipeline of 
investment leads and build capacity for assisting investors during the process of establishing their 
operations. Additionally, the project will assess current investor aftercare functions and provide 
training and other capacity building activities to ensure client➢❨ s effective support to existing 
investors, with the goal to encourage reinvestment. Technical assistance will be provided to 
prepare information packages and implement targeted investor outreach efforts in the priority 
value chains. Finally, the project will include additional support to the implementation of the 
revamped Investment policy and legal framework, including an assessment of existing incentives. 
 
45. Subcomponent 2.3 Improving the regulatory environment. This component will support key 
regulatory and administrative reforms to remove barriers to private sector activity in agribusiness. 
Strong emphasis will be given to ensure capacity for implementation of amended regulations is in 
place and adequate monitoring systems are developed. In these, the project will focus on those 
areas (i) have been identified as key constraints by analysis and private sector actors in the 
priority value chains, and (ii) where there is clear government commitment. This subcomponent 
will be closely coordinated with efforts to support regulatory improvements in the business 
environment under the DPL series and other World Bank Advisory work, including support in the 
areas measured by the Doing Business report. Areas for support will be confirmed based on the 
value chains selected. The following four areas have been identified as problematic in initial 
consultations with agribusiness private sector actors: 
 
- Policy and competition barriers in agricultural inputs: limited supply and high costs of improved 
seeds, fertilizers, and equipment is a critical constraint to increased productivity and production. 
The project will support studies to assess existing constraints affecting input availability including 
sector policies, tariffs, entry barriers and market competition. Recommendations emanating from 
these studies will inform public-private dialogue and the development of actions to address 
existing constraints. The project will provide technical assistance for implementation of these 
actions. 
 
- Trade facilitation and identification, classification and removal of Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs): 
Given Angola➢❨ s dependency on imports for food and agriculture inputs and the country➢❨ s 
objective to develop exports as a way to diversify export revenues away from oil, an efficient

trade environment is essential. Building on ongoing reform efforts, the project will identify 
activities that will further simplify trade logistics systems and services, focusing on reducing the 
time and cost associated with international trade, through coordinated agency efforts. In addition, 
NTBs in Angola severely hamper the import of key products and inputs. There is a strong need to 
streamline NTBs, especially those related to agriculture. This exercise would include building 
capacity for streamlining non-tariff measures (NTMs) and identifying and removing non-tariff 
barriers, effective simplification of import-export procedures, and strengthening risk-management 
approaches for SPS (Sanitary and Phytosanitary) and TBT (Technical Barriers to Trade) 
measures. 
 
- Land administration: This subcomponent will support targeted interventions to strengthen land 
management and administration. Land in Angola is owned by the Government and the 2004 Land 
Law (Lei de Terras de Angola, Lei 09/04) defines the mechanisms for the Government to grant 
transferable land use rights for rural and urban land. The law recognizes customary uses, and the 
Government can grant surface rights to individuals and entities. Land is a delicate issue in 
Angola. It is estimated that 85-90% of the land is not registered due to weaknesses in land 
administration institutions, among other factors. Given the magnitude of this challenge, the 
project will focus on local level interventions based on needs identified in the priority value 
chains and focus on transparent and fair procedures for land acquisition and regularization, 
protecting communities➢❨  rights to land use and natural resources. The project will build on the 
experience of the FAO implemented Land Project and will follow the ➢❨ principles for 
responsible agriculture investments➢❨ . 
 
- Regulatory reforms to promote agriculture finance: In addition to the catalytic interventions to 
promote access to credit, the project would support reform efforts to improve the enabling 
environment for agriculture finance. Activities will be defined during preparation, but may 
include diagnosis and support to reforms to enable agricultural equipment leasing, establish a 
moveable asset registry, warehouse receipts and commodities exchange development, and 
agriculture insurance (including weather base d index insurance). 
 
46.  Component 3 ➢❨  Project Management, Coordination and Public-Private Dialogue (PPD) 
(US$ 15 million). This component will support the costs of establishing and funding the Project 
Implementation Unit (PIU), which will be comprised of a technical team, supplemented by 
external consultants, to manage the following activities: Project Manager, Financial Management, 
Procurement, Social and Environmental Safeguards, Monitoring & Evaluation, Technology & 
Information, among others. Lessons learnt from Bank operations in several weak and fragile 
environments suggest that both Borrower and Bank teams typically tend to underestimate project 
implementation costs, and run into associated difficulties. The team will re-visit the estimated 
costs of implementation during project preparation. In addition, this component will address 
existing weaknesses in implementation capacity, coordination, and public-private dialogue for 
development of commercial agriculture by (i) providing capacity building and technical assistance 
to the inter-agency working group to be created by MINAGRI to coordinate project activities, and 
(ii) creating and implementing a PPD platform. 
 
47. Subcomponent 3.1 Project Implementation Unit and coordination support. This component 
will fund the activities of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU). Strong emphasis on capacity 
building based on the experience from MOSAP will be included in this component. The MOSAP 
PIU, which will remain in place for SADCP, will be used during project preparation, but the

client has requested creating a separate PIU for this project. This component will also provide 
technical assistance and training to the inter-agency working group to be established by 
MINAGRI to coordinate project implementation. Support may include successful experiences 
from other countries in planning, development of action plans, and implementation monitoring, 
among others. 
 
48. Subcomponent 3.2. Establishing Public-Private Dialogue. The project will support increased 
public-private dialogue specific to the agribusiness sector. An assessment will be conducted on 
existing public-private dialogue mechanisms in Angola. Recommendations for establishing an 
inclusive public-private dialogue platform, including institutional arrangements, will be 
developed, followed by technical assistance for implementation. The objective of the dialogue 
will be to ensure private sector inputs to sector policies and programs, including the identification 
of priority value chains, identify specific constraints and remedy actions to increase private 
investment, and assess implementation progress, as well as avenues to improve the effectiveness 
of public investments. In addition to government and private sector, efforts will be undertaken to 
ensure the maximum representativeness of the PPD including farmer organizations, as well as 
other stakeholders as relevant, such as academia or civil society. Special attention will be given to 
ensure the voice of women is well represented and the specific constraints for women in 
agribusiness are discussed in the PPD.

II. SAFEGUARDS
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis (if known)
49.  The project is expected to be at national scale however, specific geographic details of the exact 
project footprint and its impacts will be determined during project preparation and will be reflected 
in the safeguards documents (ESMF, ESIA, MP, RPF, and RAP, PMP, etc.).

B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
50.  At the framework level, there are no relevant gaps between the Angolan environmental 
legislation and the World Bank➢❨ s Safeguard policy and guidelines. The environmental legislation 
in Angola is quite recent and inspired by the international Conventions that Angola takes part. In 
regard to the environmental impact assessment, the existing Angolan regulatory framework covers 
the most relevant principles and best practices, including public consultation and participation, 
monitoring and licensing procedures. 
 
51.  The Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) through the Institute for Agriculture Development 
(IDA) will be the lead implementing agency. IDA will have the responsibility of coordinating 
implementation by hosting a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) with sub PIUs at Province level, 
tasked with the responsibility of project coordination and management using Technical Assistance 
(TA) when needed. MINAGRI has acquired reasonable experience in handling World Bank projects 
that require Safeguards attention, such as MOSAP. Hence, Commercial Agriculture Development 
Project will build up from the experience in safeguards management acquired by IDA-MINAGRI 
during MOSAP implementation. Nonetheless, substantial capacity building and training will be 
required to deal with this project Safeguards requirements, particularly in ensuring adequate 
subproject screening and subsequent preparation of ESIA/ESMP and RAP as necessary.

D. POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental Assessment 
OP/BP 4.01

Yes The construction of rural roads, electricity and water 
infrastructure for irrigation , including a series of 
land administration reforms, under component 2.3, 
may have adverse impacts on soil, water, air quality, 
flora and fauna. Some of the adverse impacts may 
include land right conflicts, soil erosion and water 
logging, alteration of water flows due to irrigation 
schemes, vegetation loss and fauna disturbance for 
access road and power transmission construction, 
risks to the human health by those handling 
pesticides. Consequently the OB/BP4.01 is triggered 
to comply with the Environmental Assessment 
safeguard requirements. Specific geographic details 
of the exact project footprint and its impacts are not 
yet know and will be determined during project 
preparation.  Hence, the recipient will prepare an 
Environmental and Social Management Framework 
(ESMF) to help mitigate the potential environmental 
and social impacts by the direct and indirect 
investments in the project selected areas and to guide 
the preparation of ESIA and ESMP. The ESMF will 
be consulted and disclosed both in-country and at the 
Infoshop prior to appraisal.

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes The project is not expected to invest in activities that 
may have direct impacts on natural habitats. 
However, rural roads improvements and water 
infrastructure may happen in proximity to national 
parks or protected areas and therefore lead to 
downstream impacts that may affect ecosystem 
services and functions provided by natural habitats. 
Hence, OP/BP 4.04 is triggered and the ESMF will 
include the specific provisions to prevent or mitigate 
impacts on natural habitats.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes The Project will not have any direct or indirect 
negative impacts on health and quality of forests, or 
the health and safety of people who depends on 
forests. However, clearance of vegetation for rural 
roads improvements and water infrastructures may 
require compensatory reforestation and tree 
maintenance along the rehabilitated roads. OP/BP 
4.36 is triggered and the ESMF will include specific 
provisions to address the requirements.

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes Promotion of agriculture activities may include the 
use of small quantities of pesticides, though expected 
only at a small scale, to treat orchards and crops 
against pest and infestations to enhance agriculture 
productivity of project beneficiaries. Hence, OP/
BP4.09 is triggered and a Pest Management Plan will 
be prepared to help mitigate potential risks to human 
health and to the environment using the integrated 
pest management approaches.

Physical Cultural Resources 
OP/BP 4.11

Yes The policy is triggered as project investments 
involve infrastructures (roads, irrigation, electricity) 
that may require large movements of earth in areas 
likely to contain sites deemed physical cultural 
resources by communities living there (e.g. holy sites 
sacred graves, sacred forests, etc.). To ensure due 
diligence, the ESMF will include a Chance Find 
procedures that will be detailed in the ESIA/ESMP 
then reflected in the constructor contracts.

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 
4.10

TBD

Involuntary Resettlement OP/
BP 4.12

Yes The project will finance activities associated with 
construction/ rehabilitation of small scale irrigation 
infrastructures, rural roads, electricity transmission 
lines that could necessitate involuntary land 
acquisition resulting in physical of people and/or loss 
of assets, means of livelihoods or resources. The 
Borrower will prepare a Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) to adequately deal with issues of 
land acquisition resulting with compensation and/or 
the physical displacement of peoples. The RPF will 
be consulted and disclosed both in-country and by 
the Bank prior to appraisal. The RPF will include 
detailed guidance for the preparation of site specific 
Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) prior or during 
project implementation.

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No

Projects on International 
Waterways OP/BP 7.50

TBD The proposed project is not expected to engage in 
large scale irrigation activities or other activities that 
would adversely affect the quality or quantity of 
water flow within shared waterways. 
Notwithstanding, triggering this policy will be 
determined once specific details of the project are 
known.

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/ No This policy is not triggered. The area in which the 
Project will be implemented is not known to include

I. Introduction and Context
Country Context

1. Tanzania has experienced strong and rapid economic growth, with its annual GDP growth averaging 
around seven percent in the last decade. Despite the strong economic growth, Tanzania is one of the 
poorest countries in Africa with approximately 13 million people (28 percent of the population) still 
living below the basic needs poverty line.

2. A rapidly expanding population will require continued growth, translating into the creation of 
employment opportunities and household wealth, just to keep pace. The population is growing at an 
average rate of 2.9 percent, one of the fastest in the world, with about 1.3 million people being added 
to the population annually (NBS, 2009). Economic expansion must be accompanied by creation of 
quality jobs if poverty rates are to continue to drop.

3. Tanzania's growth and economy depend heavily on its renewable natural assets such as water, 
forests, and wildlife. Almost half of GDP is harnessed from natural resources in agriculture, energy, 
and tourism.  An estimated 89 percent of the country's water withdrawals are for irrigation, which 
contributes to 20 percent of agricultural production from 6 percent of the land. An estimated 90 
percent of Tanzania's energy needs are satisfied by water and wood fuels: hydropower generates 39 
percent of the installed 1,438MW electricity generation capacity, while charcoal and fuel wood serve 
as the overwhelming source of energy for urban and rural households. Tanzania's tourism industry - 
which is largely based on the country's unique natural resources and wildlife - is an important driver of 
the national economy, generating $1.88 billion in revenues in 2013, or 13 percent of GDP, in 2013. 
Tourism contributes approximately 28% the total export earnings in 2013.

4. The majority of the population lives in rural areas, and is dependent on natural resources in the form 
of food, fuel, and fodder. In 2010, an estimated 73.6 percent of Tanzanians were rural residents. These

people largely comprise 80 percent of Tanzanian households who depend on agriculture, the majority 
of which is rain fed, as their primary economic activity. Food security is often supplemented by bush 
meat protein. They depend overwhelmingly on forests for their energy; only 3 percent of rural 
populations have access to electricity, with most households being dependent on charcoal or fuel 
wood.

5. Rural poverty remains pervasive and deep. All data sources suggest that Tanzania has not made 
adequate progress in raising incomes in rural areas, where the majority of the poor live. Lack of access 
to technology, credit, water, and power resulted in stagnant productivity and high vulnerability to 
shocks, leaving many rural households in the same or weaker position as at the beginning of the 
century.

6. Slowing agricultural growth is a challenge in the rural space. The agricultural sector has seen its 
share of the economy decline from 48 percent in 1990 to 28 percent in 2010. Agricultural GDP grew at 
around 4 percent per year since 2000, or only around 1 percent in per capita terms, with acute droughts 
in 2004 and 2006. Yields of staple crops, which are the livelihood of small farmers, appear to have 
been flat or declining, with agricultural growth primarily driven by extension of cultivated areas, along 
with modest shifts in the composition of crop production.

7. Addressing rural poverty will require the creation of new off-farm jobs. The share of goods and 
services exports of GDP has grown from 13.4 percent in 2000 to 23.2 in 2009. In 1998, minerals and 
non-factor services, mainly tourism, accounted for 47 percent of exports, while they rose to 66 percent 
by 2010. In 2013, tourism represented the largest source of foreign exchange. At the same time, the 
share of traditional agricultural exports declined from 60 percent of total exports in 1998 to 12 percent 
in 2009, replaced mostly by tourism and minerals such as gold. Manufacturing exports have grown by 
about 17 percent annually since 2005, but account for less than 5 percent of GDP and 25 percent of 
total merchandise trade. Efforts to promote rural development must look to expanding off-farm 
employment opportunities. Tanzania's tourism industry, which is predominantly wildlife-based, 
provides an important potential source of new rural jobs and household revenues, provided linkages 
with local communities are in place.

Sectoral and Institutional Context

8. Tanzania's natural resource-based economic sectors such as wildlife-based tourism have strong 
potential for generating economic growth, creating jobs, and improving livelihoods. Tanzania is one of 
the world's mega diverse countries with its outstanding wildlife, ecosystems, and other natural assets, 
and represents a prime global tourist destination with significant potential for growth. It is the 
abundance of wildlife and unique ecosystems that have made Tanzania a prime African tourist 
destination, generating significant revenues. In fact, Tanzania is very successful in attracting high-
expenditure tourists; Tanzania earns more money per tourist than any other country in Sub-Saharan 
Africa. Notably, despite significantly fewer tourist arrivals, its tourism sector earned as much as 
neighboring Kenya before the recent decline of tourism in the latter due to security concerns. 
Tanzania's "low-volume high-value" approach has significant economic, social and environmental 
benefits, particularly in ecologically sensitive areas such as the greater Serengeti eco-system and other 
areas.

9. Tourism today is largely concentrated on a few areas, in and around the Serengeti, Ngorogoro 
Crater, and Mount Kilimanjaro (i.e., the "Northern Circuit") and Zanzibar. While there are many high-
potential tourism sites, ranging from high mountains to spectacular landscapes and coral-fringed 
beaches, there are signs of over-crowding. Pressures on the carrying capacity of key ecosystems such 
as the greater Serengeti lead to concerns that future expansion of visitors in some of Tanzania's key 



Page 3 of 9

attractions may soon undermine the quality of the tourism experience. As highlighted in a recent 
World Bank study (in draft), the expansion of the tourism sector must consider options to ensure that 
growth in tourism does not compromise the natural asset base; that is, efforts to increase tourism 
numbers and revenues must not undermine the quality of the very resource base that tourists are 
attracted and paying to see.

10. The Government of Tanzania (GOT) is keen to develop new tourism products to expand the 
tourism sector while in core areas maintaining the low-volume high-value approach that has been 
successful in capturing the highest per capita revenue in the region. Specifically, it is interested in 
developing a more diversified tourism sector that balances the focus on the "Northern Circuit" with 
developing the "Southern Circuit", which includes a number of parks (i.e., Ruaha, Katavi, Mahale, 
Kitulo), game reserves (Selous being the largest), two Rift Valley lakes (Nyasa and Tanganyika), and 
other areas of cultural interest. Such elements would be a core part of an updated tourism policy.

11. The sustainable management of natural resources is fundamental to Tanzania's economic growth. 
Natural resources are among the few assets that Tanzania's poor access and utilize. Sustainable 
management of natural resources is therefore an integral part of development, poverty alleviation and 
growth. This suggests that depletion of the natural resource base will inevitably compromise poverty 
alleviation efforts unless there is rapid and exponential growth in employment to absorb labor 
surpluses and provide high quality jobs. Already, poor land use and watershed management practices, 
which lead to degradation of forests and watercourses, are threatening the very natural resource base 
upon which Tanzania's economy and poor depend on, while rampant wildlife poaching threatens to 
reduce the assets that are key to current and future tourism potential. Recent GOT studies point to the 
need to ensure that decisions on development initiatives are supported by robust data and information 
in order to avoid unintentional externalities, which can in turn lead to constrained future development 
opportunities. Given the strong links with poverty, livelihoods, and food security, particular care 
should be taken to ensure sound management of land, water, and wildlife are a core focus of any rural 
intervention.

12. Water is at the heart of the sustainable natural resource management imperative. Tanzania, long 
considered a water-rich nation, is increasingly struggling with local incidences of water insecurity, 
driven by unsustainable levels of agricultural abstraction and poor watershed and land management. In 
some areas, such as the Pangani, Rufiji, Wami-Ruvu and the Internal Drainage Basins, conflicts over 
water among different users - farmers, hydropower plants, wildlife - are already undermining 
economic potential of sectoral investments in agriculture, energy and tourism, and may curtail 
Tanzania's ambitious growth plans. Notably, some of the areas targeted for increased irrigation under 
various government programs are already known to suffer from some degree of water conflict.

13. For example, the Great Ruaha River provides about 56 percent of flow to the Mtera and Kidatu 
power plants, which together are responsible for 50 percent of the country's total hydropower capacity. 
Within the Great Ruaha basin, expansion of (mainly rice) agriculture in the Usangu Plains from about 
14,500 ha in 1986, to 24,000 ha in 1998, to 115,000 ha in 2013, 87 percent of which is small-scale 
informal irrigation farms. As a result of this irrigation expansion, the Great Ruaha River has since 
2005 gone from a perennial river, serving as the lifeblood of Ruaha National Park, and a key input to 
the Mtera/Kidatu power system, to a seasonal river, leading to impacts on tourism and wildlife, power 
production and Tanzania's economy.

14. The sustainable management of natural resources across users at the watershed, landscape and 
ecosystem levels is a key condition to the success of the government's plans. Responding to this 
challenge requires strong cross-sectoral coordination and action. Improved watershed management, 



Page 4 of 9

including promoting sound landscape management and conservation practices, is needed to ensure the 
long-term productivity of key basins. Recent studies by the GOT suggest that while achieving 
important short-term goals in target sectors, these programs may unintentionally lead to negative 
consequences in other sectors and over the longer term.

15. Specifically, the impact of unplanned irrigation expansion in the Great Ruaha sub basin on 
downstream flow, has led to significant negative impacts on tourism (in Ruaha National Park) and 
energy generation (at Mtera and Kidatu dams) as noted in the Ministry of Water's Integrated Water 
Resources Management and Development Plan for Rufiji Basin. Likewise the Strategic Regional 
Environmental and Social Assessment undertaken for the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor 
points to the need for careful planning of agricultural development in order to avoid unintended 
downstream impact on water quantity and quality.

16. Climate change represents an additional important risk for Tanzania's natural asset-based growth. 
Tanzania is already experiencing changes in its climate: the average temperature rose by 1°C between 
1960 and 2006, and models indicate future increases in average annual temperatures between 1°C to 
3°C by the 2050s. Likewise, precipitation is increasingly unpredictable with studies showing a shift in 
the onset of the rainy season(s). Changes in timing and quantity of rainfall are also predicted, with 10 
percent annual precipitation decreases possible in the south, decreases up to 26 percent in the north, 
and heavier, more concentrated rain events along the coast.  Water security, which is already under 
threat from current climate variability and social, economic and environmental change, is likely to be 
under greater threat from future changes in the climate. Increasing temperatures and changing rainfall 
patterns will have multi-dimensional effects on the Tanzanian economy, affecting agricultural 
productivity, energy use, water dynamics, and the wildlife upon which tourism depends. Efforts to 
promote climate resilience in these key natural asset-based sectors will have important longer-term 
effects on food security and livelihoods.

17. To achieve the GOT's goal to expand broad-based tourism in a sustainable way, a long-term 
concerted effort is needed.  The following deserve special attention:
- Managing water resources. Water is an increasingly scarce resource in many areas critical for 
wildlife and tou rism, including the Rufiji Basin, which is dominated by the Great Ruaha River. This 
has far reaching consequences for the ecology of parks, such as Ruaha.
- Developing the value proposition and strategy for tourism, with a focus on the "Southern Circuit". 
Market research, positioning, planning, and focused development are needed to utilize and 
commercialize the area's tourism potential. Strong public and private sector partnership would be 
important to leverage respective roles.
- Providing an enabling environment for the private sector. There are many obstacles for private 
operators to enter and operate in the tourism sector in Tanzania, particularly for local operators. The 
policy and regulatory environment, including a comprehensive look at the licensing requirements, 
would need to be reformed.
- Developing visitor infrastructure. Infrastructure, such as air strips, visitor services, logistics, 
hospitality, and park management investments, are essential elements of enhancing accessibility and 
the overall quality of the tourism product.
- Curbing wildlife poaching. One of the key threats to the management of existing and potential 
tourism assets is the recent unprecedented increase in wildlife poaching. Elephant populations in 
Tanzania have declined precipitously: between 2009 and 2013, populations in the Selous -Mikumi 
Ecosystem declined by 66 percent, while in the Ruaha-Rungwa ecosystem, populations declined by 
36.5 percent. The crisis has been fueled by the rising price of ivory in the illegal destination markets, 
which provides a strong incentive to local populations who do not otherwise see direct benefits from 
wildlife.

- Linking tourism with local economies and communities. Despite the national economic importance 
of tourism, at the local level communities in and around protected areas are some of the poorest in the 
country. While in other African countries (such as Namibia, Mozambique and parts of Kenya), tourism 
is providing an important source of revenue and employment to local communities, Tanzania's current 
policies, which aim to promote local benefit from tourism, have not been as effective. Rather, local 
populations, which are highly dependent on natural resources for food, fodder and fuel, generally 
consider wildlife to be worth more dead than alive. Sustainable tourism development would need to 
rely on stronger connection with local economies through training and job creation, supply chain 
development, and other forms of benefit sharing.

Relationship to CAS

18. The proposed Project is consistent with the Bank's Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report 
(CPSPR) FY12-15 (Report No. 80313-TZ) for the United Republic of Tanzania that was discussed by 
the Board on July 3, 2014. The CPSPR has two strategic clusters: (i) Productive investments for 
growth of labor-intensive industries and job creation; and (ii) Programs that target reduction of 
extreme poverty and improvements in quality of social services and six strategic objectives. The 
proposed project contributes to CPSPR strategic cluster one - Productive investments for growth of 
labor-intensive industries and job creation. The proposed project contributes to the CPSPR's second set 
of activities under cluster one which addresses key infrastructure gaps and promotes sustainable 
management of natural resources. In particular, the proposed project enhances ecosystem resilience 
and improves the environmental services of natural resources through development of infrastructure to 
better protect environmental assets. The project would also enhance capacities of government 
institutions at the national, districts and village levels as well as park and wildlife management 
authorities.

19. The proposed Project is one of the initiatives which contribute to the TerrAfrica Platform for 
Sustainable Land and Water Management (SLWM). It also supports the African Wildlife for 
Development Program in support of the Elephant Protection Initiative supported by the Bank and the 
Global Environment Facility (GEF) along with other development partners.

20. The proposed project also contributes to the GOT's strategies and plans, in particular current jobs 
creation initiatives, tourism development and tourism growth, and rural economic development.

II. Proposed Development Objective(s)
Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)

21. The Project Development Objective (PDO) and the Global Environment Objective (GEO) of the 
proposed project are to improve natural resources management in priority areas of Southern Tanzania. 
By achieving the proposed PDO, the Project will assist the GOT in addressing rural poverty which has 
been persistent in and around the country?s parks and game reserves, home to globally significant 
biodiversity. The objective would be achieved through the provision of capital investments, technical 
assistance and capacity building for communities living in and around the priority areas, and 
government institutions at the national, sub-national and local levels.
Key Results (From PCN)
22. The achievement of the PDO and key results will be measured by a set of key outcome indicators. 
Proposed key outcome indicators are listed below.

a. Land area brought under an improved and climate resilient catchment system (ha).
b. Protected area management effectiveness enhanced (%);
c. Number of visitor bed nights in targeted areas with tourism potential (%); and

III. Preliminary Description
Concept Description

23. The PDO will be achieved through the following four project components.

24. Component 1 - Improving management and development of priority tourism assets (Total Cost 
US$50m). This component will focus on investments that aim at improving the management of natural 
resources inside priority protected areas in southern Tanzania to increase tourism. The expected 
outcome of this component is an increased number of tourists and bed nights in priority tourism sites. 
Expected outputs include (i) an adopted tourism strategy for Southern Tanzania; (ii) an adopted 
tourism master plan for southern Tanzania; (iii) number of roads, enhanced airstrips, viewing 
platforms, and visitor centers built; (v) a strengthened monitoring system in place to improve wildlife 
protection; (vi) number of trainings conducted; and (vii) strengthened policy and institutional 
framework.

Sub-Component 1.1: Improve the knowledge base at (i) the sub-national level by assessing tourism 
potential and investment needs, developing a new tourism strategy, and a tourism master plan for 
southern Tanzania; and (ii) the site level through ecological monitoring and conservation planning and 
integrated planning for key tourism aspects.

Sub-Component 1.2: Improve tourism infrastructure to enhance accessibility and the overall quality of 
the tourism product, including through, e.g., building unpaved roads inside protected areas to provide 
improved access to viewing areas, enhancing airstrips to allow for planes to safely land, and building 
viewing platforms and visitor centers. Develop Public Private Partnership (PPP) model to help 
enhance tourism asset management and accessibility.

Sub-Component 1.3: Improve the capacity for management of tourism assets. Improve the capacity for 
management and development of tourism assets through training and supplying of goods including for 
wildlife monitoring.

Sub-Component 1.4: Strengthen policy and institutional framework including through private-public 
dialogue.

25. Component 2 - Enhancing local economic benefits from tourism (Total Costs US$20m). This 
component will support investments that ensure local communities in vicinity to the protected areas 
benefit from tourism. The expected outcomes of this component are increased community employment 
levels in tourism and wildlife related sectors, while expected outputs include: (i) creation of PPP 
ventures in priority areas; (ii) number of micro-finance groups operational; (iii) number of tourism 
infrastructure outputs to promote local benefits built; and (iv) an adopted policy and institutional 
framework.

Sub-Component 2.1: Strengthen supply value chains for local communities and businesses that are 
linked to tourism (e.g., vocational training to enhance skills in communities to better participate in 
improved labor market such as hospitality industry and guide services), and infrastructure to promote 
local benefits may be supported (e.g., building schools).

Sub-Component 2.2: Build awareness and capacity to engage with the private sector including through 
nurturing SMEs and enabling PPPs. Develop model and associated processes to help ensure local 



Page 7 of 9

economic benefits when using PPP to enhance tourism asset management and accessibility.

Sub-Component 2.3: Build capacity for communities to manage wildlife and tourism (e.g., 
investments in community co-management initiatives).

Sub-Component 2.4: Provide access to finance (e.g., piloting targeted support in the form of micro-
finance or grants to support alternative livelihood development including activities linked with tourism 
supply and support).

Sub-Component 2.5: The policy and institutional framework will be strengthened.

26. Component 3 - Improving landscape management (Total Cost US$20m). This component will 
support investments and technical assistance to promote the integrated management of landscapes with 
an aim to securing environmental services within priority sub-basins in Southern Tanzania.  The 
expected outcomes for this component are improved land management in watersheds that are critical 
for agricultural productivity and/or priority tourism assets. Expected outputs include (i) number of 
watershed management plans prepared, (ii) number of improved soil and water management measures 
in place; and (iii) number of incentive programs established.

Sub-Component 3.1: Support activities to sustainably manage watersheds through a participatory 
process.  Depending on the size of the watershed, a planning unit will be micro-watershed of XX ha.  
The key activities include inter alia (i) planning, implementation of micro-watershed plans, and related 
capacity building (e.g., link village land use planning with watershed planning, studies), and (ii) 
communication and awareness raising activities.

Sub-Component 3.2: Strengthen small-scale water and land management through (i) implementation 
of measures developed in planning process referred to in component 1.1 above; (ii) check dams, 
control gates, and erosion control measures to reduce run-off and improve water use efficiency; (iii) 
reforestation and reduced deforestation; and (iv) sustainable incentive programs such as payment for 
environment services to promote water use efficiency and upper watershed management for protecting 
water sources.

Sub-Component 3.3: Strengthen policy and decision-making capabilities to support the protection of 
key natural assets. Activities will include (i) an inventory of key wetland, wildlife and tourism areas; 
(ii) improved monitoring; and (iii) capacity building for analytics to inform decision-making.

27. Component 4: Project management (Total cost: $10m). This Component will focus on project 
management arrangements and mechanisms including monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and 
implementation. In addition, funds under this Component will be used to support the procurement of 
essential goods and equipment such as vehicles, office equipment and furniture, imagery, software and 
other accessories, etc. To strengthen project management, funds would be available to finance selected 
technical assistance such as for safeguards, fiduciary management, and monitoring and evaluation. The 
expected outcome of this component would be the effective implementation of the project activities 
with due diligence and efficiency.

Appraisal was carried out from March 17 to 25.

I. Project Context
Country Context
Morocco has been on a steady path of growth in the past decades, which has proved relatively 
resilient in the face of the recent global economic slowdown. Growth averaged 4.8 percent over 
2001-12 compared to 2.8 percent in the 1990s, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita 
doubled from 2001 to 2012 reaching US$2,951, unemployment declined from 13.6 percent in 2000 
to 9 percent in 2012, and absolute poverty decreased from 15.3 percent in 2001 to 8.8 percent in 
2008. 
 
The Arab Spring that has swept the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region in early 2011 
spurred a peaceful political transformation in Morocco. Morocco had engaged on a wide-ranging 
reform program, with the adoption of a new constitution through a popular referendum on July 1, 
2011. The new constitution lays the foundation for extended regionalization as a democratic and 
decentralized system of governance. It also contributes to improving the status of women through 
the adoption of the principle of gender equality and through provisions on increasing the

participation of women in decision-making bodies. In November 2011, parliamentary elections 
followed the promulgation of the constitution, leading to the formation of a four-party coalition 
government that has embraced the constitution's principles and called for more social solidarity and 
inclusion.  
 
Inequality, poverty, and vulnerability remain important challenges in Morocco. A quarter of the 
population is still economically vulnerable (near-poverty). There are persistent disparities as 70 
percent of poverty is still rural, and most development indicators in rural areas lag behind urban 
areas, largely as a result of difficult geography, deteriorating infrastructure, poor access to basic 
services, and limited capital investments to improve labor value added and hence returns to self-
employment and contract labor. Ten percent of Morocco’s 13.4 million rural residents lived below 
the poverty line in 2011. Rural poverty exacerbates gender disparity with relatively higher illiteracy 
and primary school dropout rates for rural women, and higher infant and maternal mortality. 
 
Morocco has engaged in a dynamic process towards strengthening economic opportunities and 
social inclusion. Several high profile development programs (e.g. the second phase of the National 
Human Development Initiative, INDH) and new sectoral strategies in the areas of education, 
employment, and youth have been initiated. Nonetheless, additional efforts are needed to support 
the country-led reforms. The movements associated with the political transition and constitutional 
changes generate pressure on the Moroccan State for credible and faster reforms, notably in the 
areas of job creation and improvement of the quality of public services delivered.

  

Sectoral and institutional Context
Agriculture is central to Morocco’s economy, as evidenced by the strong correlation among GDP 
and agriculture GDP. Over the last agricultural campaign, thanks to favorable weather, the sector 
represented 15.6 percent of GDP, contributing the most to the country’s overall growth. The 20 
percent increase in agricultural production allowed Morocco’s GDP to jump from 2.7 percent in 
2012 to 4.4 percent in 2013. The agricultural sector represents a critical element in the country’s 
demographic and socio-economic situation, generating 40 percent of the jobs nationwide, mostly in 
rural areas where the majority of the poor live. The sector is largely composed of small farmers 
mostly dedicated to low-value agriculture, but also counts a limited group of dynamic and well 
performing large farmers with state-of-the-art technologies and well integrated into the national and 
international markets. The sector exhibits great gender disparities. Women’s work is typically 
unpaid (in 2003-04, 58 percent of cases; in 2008, 91 percent), or it is seasonal and unstable when 
remunerated (59 percent of cases in 2003-04; 84 percent in 2008). 
 
Irrigation increases both the level and stability of incomes in rural areas. Despite representing only 
16 percent of the cultivated land, irrigated agriculture contributes to about half of the agriculture 
GDP, 75 percent of agricultural exports, and 15 percent of overall merchandise exports. The 
country has 1.46 million ha of permanently irrigated land, 682,600 ha of which are part of nine 
Large Scale Irrigation (LSI) perimeters operated by nine public agricultural development agencies 
(ORMVA). ORMVAs are autonomous agencies under the supervision of the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Maritime Fisheries (MAPM), with the responsibility of constructing new irrigation 
schemes, rehabilitating and modernizing existing ones, ensuring Operation and Maintenance 
(O&M) of irrigation and drainage facilities, and providing extension services to farmers. The 
remaining area is shared between small and medium scale traditional irrigation schemes managed 
by Water Users Associations (WUA, 334,000 ha) and private irrigation (441,000 ha). Morocco is

among the first countries with experience in irrigation Public-Private Partnership (PPP). In 2004, it 
launched the first successful irrigation PPP in the world, in the citrus production perimeter of 
Guerdane. Other PPP are at various stages of preparation (Azemmour Bir Jdid, Dar Khrofa, 
Chtouka). 
 
The ability of irrigated agriculture to continue to drive shared prosperity in Morocco is threatened 
by increasing water scarcity. Reduced rainfall, increased rainfall variability, reduced run off, 
groundwater depletion, and degradation of water resources have reached alarming levels. Annual 
renewable water resources total 22 billion m3, corresponding to 730 m3/inhabitant, which is below 
the United Nations’ threshold for indicating water stress (1,000 m3/inhabitant). The water deficit is 
estimated at around 2 billion m3. Climate change is expected to worsen this situation. Impacts of 
climate change are already visible in Morocco: the proportion of dry years increased by four times 
and surface water availability decreased by 35 percent between the period 1947-1976 and 
1977-2006. Water scarcity impacts irrigated agriculture in different ways: 
• In private irrigation, which largely relies on groundwater, reduced and more variable 
rainfall translates into groundwater overexploitation. The majority of the wells are neither 
registered nor monitored, and improvement in water pumping technologies and butane subsidy 
facilitate overextraction. Decreasing groundwater levels have a specific equity dimension, 
impacting at first smallholders with less capacity for drilling and pumping deeper.  
• In LSI perimeters, which rely on surface water, water scarcity translates into reduced 
volumes allocated to farmers and limits summer crops production. While agriculture remains the 
primary user of surface water, accounting for about 85 percent of the withdrawals, severe 
restrictions in irrigation have been common in the last 15 years. LSI perimeters in the Oum er Rbia 
river basin received, on average, only 60 percent of the water volumes they were designed for. 
These volumes were consistently lower than the water allocation stated in the Regional Masterplans 
for Integrated Water Resources Management (PDAIRE). Wherever possible, farmers in LSI 
perimeters have been making up for this shortfall by complementing water allocated by the 
ORMVAs with groundwater, bearing the extra pumping costs and further aggravating groundwater 
depletion.  
Farmers in LSI perimeters face structural constraints that limit the productive use of the scarce 
water resource. These include among others: collective water management, rigid water distribution 
rules, frequent shut-downs, unequal access to water, and land tenure issues. All of these constraints 
lock farmers in LSI perimeters into a low-risk and low return equilibrium in which they carry out 
low input, extensive farming focused on low value crops, and avoid more capital intensive 
strategies which allow for high value products and higher returns but bear higher risks in case of 
water deficiencies. 
 
LSI perimeters suffer from aging irrigation networks and poor Operation and Maintenance (O&M). 
The ORMVAs have limited budget to improve this situation. Recovery rates in Morocco are 
amongst the best in MENA, varying between 68 and 100 percent, with an average of 76 percent 
(2010). In some LSI perimeters, water tariffs are insufficient to cover the operation and 
maintenance (O&M) costs, and even more so the amortization costs, translating into the need for 
subsidies from the Government. Tariffs in LSI perimeters vary between 0.27 and 0.77DH/m3 
depending on the perimeters and the associated energy bill, compared to 1.30 to 1.80DH/m3 in 
perimeters managed through PPP. While there was an increase in O&M budget since 2009 (average 
2001-08: Tadla DH14.6 M, Doukkala: DH18.6 M; average 2009-13: Tadla DH31.1 M, Doukkala 
DH36.8 M), the allocation remains insufficient to meet the needs. Cost recovery rates in Morocco 
are amongst the highest in MENA, varying between, 68 and 100 percent, with an average of 76

percent (2010). While the recovery of water bills should be improved in the LSI perimeters were 
the most important arrears are generated, this increase would not be sufficient to meet the financial 
needs of the ORMVAs. Consequently, a plan to increase water tariffs in LSI perimeters was laid out 
in 2011, but it sparked protests by farmers, which led the Government of Morocco (GoM) to 
postpone the measure. A political economy analysis of the irrigation sector reform, revealed that 
there is typically no capacity to pay problem, and that the main reason for farmers’ opposition was 
the lack of direct improvements in service quality associated with tariff increase. 
 
The GoM is putting in place incentives, investments, and institutional reforms to ensure greater 
returns at the farm and overall economy levels in light of increasingly restricted water resource. 
This is done through two synergic strategies: 
• The Morocco Green Plan (PMV) aims to double the agriculture sector’s value-added and 
create 1.5 million jobs by 2020, thus transforming the sector into a stable source of growth, 
competitiveness, and broad-based economic development. In addition to its transversal institutional 
and policy reforms, the PMV comprises two Pillars reflecting the dualistic nature of Moroccan 
agriculture: Pillar I targets commercial farmers and their integration into the national and 
international markets, while Pillar II targets small farmers mainly in marginal areas. Under both 
pillars, technology and organizational support is provided to implement an agri-food chain 
approach linking farmers to market. The Agricultural Development Fund (FDA), the GoM’s 
principal agricultural subsidy instrument, has been reformed and support measures aligned with the 
strategic directions of the PMV. Since PMV’s launch in 2008, production has increased by 45 
percent, agricultural exports have risen by 18 percent, and 77,000 permanent jobs have been 
created. 
• The National Plan for Saving Water in Irrigation (PNEEI) promotes more productive water 
use by introducing efficient irrigation technologies (mainly drip irrigation) on 555,000 ha of the 
country’s irrigated land by 2020, of which 335,000 ha in private farms and 220,000 ha in LSI 
perimeters. This process is supported though the FDA, with up to 100 percent subsidy for the 
adoption of drip and microsprinkler irrigation, and up to 70 percent subsidy for sprinkler irrigation. 
Since PNEEI’s launch in 2008, the adoption of drip irrigation has been proceeding at a fast pace in 
privately developed irrigation areas, with over 200,000 ha completed (60 percent of the 2020 
target). In LSI perimeters, conversion is ongoing on 57,000 ha only, due to the need for prior 
investments in the irrigation networks. The figure is expected to increase steadily in the coming 
future, considering that pre-feasibility studies in LSI perimeters have been completed for 100,000 
ha. While impacts remain to be observed, field experiments in Tadla demonstrated that agricultural 
water productivity (defined as value of produce per unit of water used) could be doubled by 
switching from the traditional surface irrigation to improved water management under drip 
irrigation. 
 
The Large Scale Irrigation Modernization project is fully aligned with the comprehensive reform 
process of Morocco. The project supports the ORMVAs of Tadla, Haouz, Doukkala and Gharb in 
providing farmers located in the LSI perimeters with an improved water service. This means 
individual access (rather than collective), on-demand (rather than on rotation), reliable (with faster 
re-establishment of the service in case of shut-downs), and equitable (in terms of flow and pressure 
across the irrigation network). Targeted farmers will be freed up of some structural constraints and 
have the opportunity to improve their farming choices, adopting improved irrigation technologies 
(mainly drip irrigation), which are more efficient in the use of the scarce water resource and better 
suited for high-value crops.

II. Proposed Development Objectives
The project development objectives are: (i) for targeted ORMVAs, to provide an improved water 
service to farmers, and (ii) for targeted farmers, to have better access to improved irrigation 
technologies.

III. Project Description
Component Name
Component 1: Improving the irrigation network infrastructure
Comments (optional)
Component 1 will construct pressurized irrigation networks to replace existing gravity networks and 
renovate existing pressurized irrigation networks. Under adequate management, the networks’ 
design will allow providing farmers with an improved water service, in line with the technical 
requirements of improved irrigation technologies. Activities include: (i) studies; (ii) technical 
assistance to monitor construction works; (iii) upgrading irrigation canals and constructing 
reservoirs; (iv) constructing feeder pipes and rehabilitating pumping stations; (v) constructing 
filtration stations; (vi) constructing distribution piped networks, or rehabilitating and extending 
existing distribution piped networks; and (vii) installing outlets and associated devices.

Component Name
Component 2: Supporting farmers’ access to improved irrigation technologies
Comments (optional)
Component 2 will strengthen farmers’ knowledge of and access to improved irrigation technologies, 
to allow them taking advantage of the improved water service provided by the ORMVAs. Farmers 
will become familiar with the advantages of the improved irrigation technologies, and will have 
easier access to financing opportunities to adopt them. Once the improved irrigation technologies is 
in place, farmers will receive irrigation advisory services, and their capacity to access, use, and 
maintain the irrigation systems will be strengthened. i Farmers will also develop better knowledge 
of their groundwater, where appropriate.

Component Name
Component 3: Supporting implementing agencies’ management of the irrigation network, and 
implementation of the project
Comments (optional)
Component 3 will strengthen the institutional capacity of the ORMVAs in operating and 
maintaining the irrigation networks, to ensure that new and improved networks are managed so to 
provide farmers with an improved water service, in line with the technical requirements of improved 
irrigation technologies. Component 3 will also support implementing the project. Component 3 
activities will include: (i) technical assistance to improve O&M of the irrigation network; (ii) 
training, technical assistance, computer equipment, and associated tools for project management; 
and (iii) implementation of the EMP; (iv) provision of equipment and infrastructure rehabilitation 
for DIAEA and ORMVAs.

V. Implementation
The project will have five implementation entities. The ORMVAs of Tadla, Haouz, Doukkala, and 
Gharb will implement most of the activities. The Department of Irrigation and Rural Infrastructure 
(DIAEA) of the MAPM will implement one activity under Component 3 and will be responsible for 
overall project coordination, management, and reporting. 
 
The DIAEA and the ORMVAs are both experienced in managing World Bank-funded projects, the 
Oum er Rbia basin irrigated agriculture modernization project (PROMER, 2010-2016) being the 
most recent. Each ORMVA targeted by the project manages a LSI perimeter covering about 100,000 
ha. They have good technical and managerial capacity to implement large irrigation development 
and modernization projects. Training and technical assistance will be provided as needed.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

1. After decades of slow growth, past reform initiatives have cumulatively strengthened structural 
competitiveness and positioned Senegal among the fastest-growing economies in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in recent 
years. Driven by progressively resurgent exports, the Senegalese economy has been expanding at almost 7 percent 
annually since 2015, when external conditions have also become more supportive, as global oil, commodities and food 
prices declined. Growth decomposition highlights the critical role of more competitive and diversified exports not only in 
the past three years, but starting from 2010, when the country reversed a historic trend of declining international 
competitiveness, although this positive effect was initially offset by large negative external shocks. The recent progress 
contrasts starkly with decades of paradoxically modest economic development, when Senegal’s per capita GDP, almost 
uniquely in Sub-Saharan Africa, remained below its level at Independence, as the economy was persistently stifled by high 
vulnerability to shocks, weak productivity and omnipresent informality.  

2. Wide-based accelerated growth since 2015 has been driven by expanding exports, fueled by economic reforms 
and a robust external demand. GDP growth accelerated from 6.5% in 2015 to 6.7% in 2016, positioning Senegal among 
the fastest growing economies in the African continent. All sectors of the economy contributed significantly to growth in 
2016 with services being the sector that contributed the most due to its large size as a share of GDP. Other demand 
components performed well, but their role as growth drivers were not as strong as exports. Total investment grew by 
8.8% in 2016 (up from 6.3% in 2015) as a result of the investment program adopted as part of the Plan Senegal Emergent 
(PSE-2014-2035, and its ongoing 5-year Priority Action Plan 2014-2018), as well as policy interventions in specific sectors, 
including agriculture. While the strong import component of investments reduces their short-term impact on growth, the 
increase in both public and private investments bodes well for future growth, particularly if the efficiency of public 
investment can be enhanced. Private consumption accelerated also as its growth rate increased from 5% in 2015 to 5.3% 
in 2016 thanks to higher income and optimistic expectations about the future of the Senegalese economy.  

3. The recent structural turnaround is anchored in prudent macro fiscal policies and supported by a favorable 
environment. On the fiscal side, the balance has improved significantly with the fiscal deficit reduced to 4.2% of GDP in 
2016 (from 4.8% in 2015) as a result of rationalized current spending stemming from the current fiscal consolidation efforts 
and higher revenues driven by better collection of custom taxes. According to the latest IMF-World Bank (WB) debt 
sustainability analysis, public debt in Senegal (60.6% of GDP in 2016) remains at a low risk of distress, but indicators are 
showing emergent strains with respect to sustainability. Also, inflation has remained under control and below the 2% 
target set by the regional central bank, thanks to the prudent regional monetary policy, exchange rate stability and 
ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts.  

4. Higher growth has resulted in an estimated drop in poverty incidence by 4 to 7 percentage points since 2011 
(from 47 percent, to 38 percent based on the international poverty line). Agriculture appears to have been one of the 
main drivers of this reduction, as it has registered low, but positive growth with two exceptionally good years in 2015 and 
2016. At the same time, rural areas have witnessed some job reallocation out of the primary sector, as households have 
diversified their livelihoods, tapping into a growing rural non-farm economy. Moreover, moderate improvements in 
general value added per agricultural worker have reversed a negative trend of more than a decade, pointing to signs of

nascent structural transformation. In urban areas, labor income among the poor has been boosted by growth in labor-
intensive sectors, such as construction.  

5. However persistent spatial disparities are evidenced, with rural areas- particularly the Groundnut Basin (GNB)- 
lagging behind their urban counterparts on a wide range of non-monetary indicators. In 2011, nearly 70 percent of the 
poor and 84 percent of the extreme poor lived in rural areas, accounting for 57 percent of the total population and 
suggesting rural poverty to be deeper and more severe. Female-headed households were less likely to be poor, as women 
tend to head smaller households, and are more likely to receive cash and in-kind transfer1. The poorest communes are 
located in the center of the country known as the Groundnut Basin (particularly in the region of Diourbel, Fatick, Kaolack 
and Kaffrine), and in the Kolda (south) and the eastern part of Tambacounda (south-east), which is also part of the 
extended groundnut basin. The poverty profile constructed using the DHS wealth indicators for 2015 suggests that the 
characteristics of the poor have largely remained unchanged since 2011 in terms of geographic distribution, households’ 
size and education levels. The extended Groundnut Basin is the country’s bread basket, supplying key staples (mostly 
millet, sorghum, and maize) and fodder from groundnuts and cowpeas. Those areas have the highest population density 
(100-120 people/km2) after the capital city area. 

6. Agriculture employs the largest share of the poor, particularly in the Groundnut Basin. Indeed, 62 percent of 
the rural population depend on agriculture, which employs more than 36 percent of the total labor force of the country, 
according to the 2015 Labor Force Survey, and poverty incidence among farmers is the highest. In rural areas, nearly 80 
percent of paid workers in the bottom quintile of the distribution of consumption worked in agriculture, while the more 
prosperous are engaged in largely informal services. Among the poorest are the farmers growing rain-fed crops particularly 
in the Groundnut Basin. Households having animal production as a main source of livelihood are also among the poorest. 
On the other hand, poverty is at its lowest rates among horticulture farmers, mainly based in the Niayes, on the coast 
between Saint-Louis and Dakar, or rice producers along the Senegal River valley. Groundnut farming is a primary source 
of income for a vast majority of family farms, accounting for about half of the total cropped area in the country and 
employing two-thirds of the rural population, mostly below the official poverty line. In fact, groundnuts are grown by 27 
percent of all households in Senegal, and by 52 percent of households in extreme poverty (ANSD, 2011). Moreover, 
supporting labor-intensive activities down the value chain, such as transportation, storage, and processing, remains an 
important source of non-farm employment in both formal and informal sectors.  

7. While the economic prospects are good with a projected real GDP growth at 7.0% in 2019, much more needs to 
be done in implementing the Government’s longer-term strategy (PSE) to transform the rural economy and reduce 
poverty and spatial imbalances. Supported by robust macroeconomic fundamentals, Senegal is expected to remain one 
of West Africa’s top growth performers, if the current internal and external conditions continue supporting this trend. 
Indeed, higher exports from the agriculture, fishery and extractives sectors would continue to drive economic growth. 
However, external shocks, delayed critical reforms to remove bottlenecks to competitiveness of key sectors and increase 
private investments, insufficient funding and/or delays in implementation major PSE programs, poor quality of public 
spending, uncertainties or slow pace of critical reforms to address key bottlenecks due to non-technical motivations are 
major risks to growth expectations. In particular and despite recent improvements in competitiveness and diversification, 
the agriculture sector would continue to be adversely exposed to volatile climatic conditions, particularly if adequate 
reforms are not implemented and substantial investments not made to reduce agricultural dependency on rainfed 
cropping systems, to adapt the groundnut value chain to changing markets, and to improve the overall resilience of the 
crops and livestock production systems to worsening climate conditions in the poorest regions, particularly the groundnut 
basin.

characteristics.

B. Sectoral (or multi-sectoral) and Institutional Context of the Program 

8. The agriculture sector has played a critical role in the Senegalese economy, but remains vulnerable to external 
shocks, which are likely to intensify with greater openness of the economy and climate change. The agriculture sector 
grew at an average rate of 3.2 percent between 2000 and 2016, but volatility around that average was large. The big 
swings in agriculture growth, which are highly correlated to large changes in the Senegalese economy’s growth rates, are 
mainly the result of weather and climatic hazards which heavily impact pastoralism and rain-fed crops such as groundnut, 
millet and other cereals that have traditionally dominated the sector. This suggests that for Senegal to maintain the high 
output growth attained since 2015, more efforts are needed to protect the agriculture sector against climatic variability 
and enhance the resilience of livelihoods in rural areas. Deteriorating climatic conditions in areas surrounding cities are 
likely to increase human migration into cities, further increasing already high urbanization rates. If left unmanaged, urban 
sprawl may worsen or even cause natural hazard events.   

9. Recent improvements in agriculture output in the past few years have been driven by expansion of cropped 
areas and an increase in the use of inputs encouraged by public policies, with limited impact on productivity and job 
creation. The Senegalese government has adopted several policies to modernize and develop the agriculture sector over 
the past few years. These policies, such as developing the skills and financial capabilities of farmers, subsidizing of high 
quality seeds, and supporting agricultural mechanization, have helped boost agriculture yields and production, in cereals, 
horticulture and pulses. The main crops that have benefited are those tagged as priority value chains under PRACAS (rice, 
onions and groundnuts, with steady increases by 160%, 74%, and 108% respectively between 2013 and 2017). Continued 
public support for rice over the last two decades - by increasing investments and implementing reforms in the irrigation 
management systems and expanding low land (and rainfed) cropping systems - is paying off with higher rice yields, 
surpassing the African average and closing the gap with the World average. The private sector has contributed to the 
improvement in agriculture productivity due to the modern processing units that were developed along the Senegal River 
Valley. However labor productivity did not improve over time - and even decreased for certain crops - mainly due to a 
decreasing land-to-labor ratio. In fact, the increase in agriculture output was largely due to an expansion of input use per 
unit of land, and to a much lesser degree to overall improvements in Total Factor Productivity (TFP), through innovation 
and better skills. Therefore, to achieve the objective of poverty reduction - poverty remains prevalent in rural areas - and 
to drive the agricultural transformation agenda, total factor productivity, and labor productivity in particular, should 
significantly increase. This requires creating more jobs for the rural workforce ('move-out' track), while supporting farmers 
to modernize and better connect to downstream segments of value chains and with the rest of the economy ('move-up' 
track) 

10. Low productivity, a weak land regime and underdeveloped infrastructure and logistics limit the potential of 
agriculture to reduce poverty. Despite the importance attributed by the Government to the agricultural sector in the Plan 
Senegal Emergent, agriculture still has the lowest productivity among all sectors, the average farmer being more than six 
times less productive than his average counterpart in the rest of the economy. This result is not surprising if one thinks 
that only 3 percent of cultivated land is irrigated; the production system is still archaic; harvest losses span between 10 
and 30 percent and access to inputs is problematic. Productivity is particularly low among the poor for whom these 
problems are exacerbated by the lack of access to productive assets and financing for farm operations. The recent success 
recorded in the subsectors of horticulture and rice, where productivity increased significantly during the last 10 years, was 
made possible by addressing some of those constraints, including through improved water management particularly in 
the Senegal River Valley, increased access to inputs (seeds, fertilizers) and machinery, and better connectivity.  

11. Addressing the overreliance of the agriculture and livestock production systems on rainfall in the Groundnut 
Basin is critical to secure agricultural growth and sustainable development. The World Bank Disaster and Risk Climate 
portal recorded the following extreme events in the past years, which have certainly influenced performance of the 
agriculture sector : (i) statistically significant decrease in wet season rainfall between 1960 and 2006, with the 500 mm 
isohyets regressing about 100 kilometers (km) to the south; (ii) high variability on inter-annual and inter-decadal

timescales, which can make long-term trends difficult to identify ; (iii) a period of particularly high rainfall in the early 
1960s, whilst the early 1980s were particularly dry; (iv) some unusually high rainfalls have occurred in the dry season in 
very recent years (2000-2006), but this has not been part of a consistent trend; (v) increased mean annual temperature 
by 0.9°C since 1960, an average rate of 0.20°C per decade. Recent projections indicate that those phenomenon are likely 
to amplify with : (i) mean annual temperatures projected to increase by 1.1 to 3.1°C by the 2060s, and 1.7 to 4.9°C by the 
2090s, with projected rates of warming faster in the interior than in those areas closer to the coast; (ii) substantial 
increases in the frequency of days and nights that are considered ‘hot’ in the current climate, with such increases occurring 
more rapidly in the south and east of the country; (iii) decreases in the frequency of days and nights considered ‘cold’ in 
the current climate; (iv) a wide range of changes in the mean annual rainfall averaged over the country, from -41 to +48% 
by the 2090s—but more models show decreases. While it is difficult to draw robust conclusions of changes in precipitation, 
it is likely however that a greater proportion of precipitation will occur in heavy rainfall events, so it is important to 
incorporate scenarios of both precipitation increases (which will further fuel soil erosion) and decreases (amplifying 
drought frequency) in future planning.  

12. The production systems in the Groundnut Basin, both for crops and livestock, are overwhelmingly rainfed and 
driven by small farmers with holdings of less than 5 ha per households. Unlike other major agroecological areas of the 
country (Senegal river valley which concentrates major irrigation investments, Costal Niayes which is the traditional 
horticultural region, and Casamance with significant water resources both from rainfall and surface water), the natural 
resource base in the Groundnut basin is poorly endowed and fragile. The majority of the area is composed of poor quality 
sandy-low organic matter content of tropical ferruginous, with allomorphic brown soils located on low lands (Badiane et 
al., 2001). Rainfall regime is increasingly erratic (600 to 900mm per year) while water quality (salinization and high 
presence of chlorine) is a major constraint to use of surface and superficial groundwater around the Sine and Saloum river 
system. Good quality and productive deep water for agriculture is available in significant amount in the deep groundwater 
tables (the Miocene and Maestrichien) in the eastern part of the Groundnut Basin but requires important investments 
well beyond the capabilities of small-scale farmers.  

13. Demographic pressure and high exposure of production systems to climate risks have led to unsustainable 
short-term coping strategies, e.g. overgrazing, extension of cultivated area, which further contribute to accelerating the 
depletion of the agricultural resource base in the Groundnut Basin. Whilst land degradation has become a genuine issue 
across the country, with 64% of the country’s 3.8 million hectares of arable land affected, the Groundnut Basin alone 
carries the heaviest burden with 47% of the total degraded land. Negative impacts of land degradation include stagnant 
or decreasing agricultural productivity, imbalanced ecosystems, which threatens waterways and the viability of wildlife 
habitats. Continuous land degradation and recurrent droughts in the Groundnut Basin increases the volatility of 
agricultural production, resulting in increased poverty and vulnerability, with a strong rate of rural and international 
migration.  These migratory flows are also at the origin of land conflicts, particularly in the Senegal River valley and in 
Casamance. 

14. Delayed adjustments to global markets trends and inefficient policies in the groundnut value chains have 
trapped groundnut farmers into a vicious cycle of low productivity-low-income-poverty loop. The global groundnut 
trade has gradually shifted from oil and meal to whole nuts, and Asia has become the major producer. Indeed, shifts in 
relative transport costs and in consumer preferences have led to a decline in global trade in groundnut products and 
significant increases in the export of whole nuts. As a result, even highly industrialized exporters tend to produce cake and 
oil only for domestic consumption, while exporting the rest as whole nuts that now dominate global trade flows2.  
Furthermore, high public spending on the groundnut value chain through various subsidies schemes (46% on seed 
subsidies, 30% on price subsidies directed to oil industries, 13% on fertilizers subsidies) accounted for around 50% of total 
public expenditures on agriculture but resulted in less than proportional impact on the added value created in the

economy. Completing the longstanding reforms in the groundnut value chain and establishing a stable and credible policy 
framework for whole nut exports would unleash the economic potential of the groundnut value chain and accelerate the 
modernization and realignment of the groundnut sector to the international markets trends. The government could also 
reorient its agricultural spending from less productive fertilizer subsidies, which were found to play little or no role in 
substantially boosting productivity across several Asian countries, to productivity-enhancing input factors such as 
agricultural R&D, climate resilient technologies and advanced irrigation techniques. This could be paired with well targeted 
social protection mechanisms to support the poorest rural households. 

15. Young men and women are subject to considerable social pressures and norms in general, and more so in rural 
areas. Key gender-based constraints facing women in the agriculture and economic growth sector are: limited access to 
and control over land because of discriminatory inheritance and land allocation practices; social beliefs about women’s 
primary roles as mothers and wives; limited access to credit and/or cash that constraints purchase of agricultural inputs; 
limited literacy and numeracy skills among rural women; and limited opportunities for business development training or 
access to agricultural extension. Finally, social norms limit youth empowerment, particularly their occupational choices or 
access to productive inputs3. School drop- out is high among young girls to marry early with limited time left for productive 
activities. Young men are encouraged to start working early, before getting married, and / or to take over the family 
business. Furthermore, access to key assets, such as land, is largely determined by customary inheritance practices4. When 
active in business, women face different challenges depending on their profiles. Those in the processing Economic Interest 
Group (EIG) are faced with the challenge of growing their operation from a semi-domestic processing unit to a high-density 
industrial production. Access to energy, growth markets, and financing are decisive factors for the expansion of their 
business. Women group may have much more complex challenges, as they have to migrate from an organizational model 
of individualized work to a collective model under a group form, with access to training and to management of group 
project, access to production inputs (fertilizers, seeds) and access to land amongst the key challenges they have to face5. 

16. The proposed Program for Results would support the Government’s Development Plan for Economic 
Emergence (Plan Senegal Emergent- PSE- 2010-2035) and its Agriculture Chapters (the Accelerated Agricultural Growth 
Program- PRACAS6, and the National Livestock Development Plan- PNDE7). The strategic objectives of PSE are to: (i) 
stimulate structural transformation of the economy to support a sustainable and dynamic growth; (ii) facilitate broad 
access to social services while preserving conditions for sustainable development, and (iii) meet requirements for good 
governance through strengthening the country’s institutions and the promotion of peace, security and regional 
integration. The PSE specific objective for the agricultural sector- understood in its broader scope (e.g. including livestock, 
fisheries and agroindustry) which is meant to spearhead the structural transformation of the economy are to : (i) 
strengthen the country’s food security to reduce the food import bill; (ii) develop competitive, high-value added and 
integrated value chains; and (iii) preserve socio-economic balance and reinvigorate the rural economy. This will be driven 
by the development of commercial agriculture as detailed in the sector operational Program (PRACAS).   

17. Implementation of the first phase of PRACAS in the period 2014-2017 has yielded significant results and 
contributing to redressing the overall performance of the agriculture sector and to the country’s economic 
performance. In the groundnut sector in particular, the Government's performance targets under PRACAS were met or 
exceeded by 2016, both in terms of seed capital renewal with 55,000 metric tons (mt) of certified seeds produced against 
a target of 40,000 mt, and in terms of total output with 1,050,000 metric tons of groundnut produced against a target of 
1,000,000 mt for 2017. Furthermore, the government has taken significant steps to eliminate monopsony around the

supply chain of oil mills, SONACOS in particular, and to improve competition for the collection and marketing of 
groundnuts in the region. The government has encouraged the entry of new operators in the collection, processing and 
export of groundnut oils and seeds, and took over SONACOS from the main shareholder for its next privatization. In 
addition, the government has also launched initiatives to encourage the diversification of cropping systems in the 
groundnut basin, with expansion of rain-fed and low-land rice cropping systems, sesame and horticulture in addition to 
livestock. 

18. Deepening the reforms in the groundnut sector, including a stable policy framework for private investments in 
the value chains and mitigating climate risks and price volatility will lay the foundation for agricultural transformation 
in the Groundnut Basin (GNB). Reforms undertaken by the government since 2014 to liberalize the groundnut market 
have started to yield results, with larger exports of nuts and new investments in the value chain (storage, deshelling 
facilities, with significant potential in term of off-farm employments). However, distortive policies to keep alive the less 
profitable segment of processing of crude oils have prevented farmers from getting the full value of expanding to global 
whole nuts markets. Within that context, developing a new value chain centered on producing high quality groundnuts 
for whole nuts exports and for the confectionery industry is needed. This requires establishing a level playing field for the 
private sector to invest and innovate in the processing and marketing segments. A key step in this direction would be to 
privatize SONACOS. At the farmers’ level reforms should address the issue of revenues volatility, including safety net 
mechanisms when both international prices and domestic production are low. 

19. The proposed Program will support the adaptation of the groundnut value chain to evolving climate and 
markets conditions and accelerate the diversification of the agricultural production systems in the Groundnut Basin for 
greater resilience to external shocks. To seize emerging market opportunities, Senegal would need to substantially 
increase and stabilize groundnut yields (actually 60% of the world average yield, compared to 200% for China), tackle the 
protracted issue of aflatoxins to meet the requirements of the high quality confectionery nuts export market, improve 
competition along the value chain and particularly in the inputs and processing segment, while accelerating the 
diversification of production systems and scaling up the adoption of climate smart-agriculture in the groundnut basin.  
This will require implementing several  adaptation measures including the wide adoption of agro-forestry techniques and 
crop diversification; the use of short-cycle varieties and that of varieties tolerant to salinity; improved collection and water 
storage (i.e. dams, retention basins, anti-salt structures, windbreaks); the expansion of community woodlots; the 
prevention of bush fires; the dissemination of fertilization techniques; the establishment of an early warning system in 
rural areas, and preventing and tackling  pest infestations, such as the West Africa Desert Locust and fruit flies which are 
major threats to expanding the lucrative business of mangoes exports from the groundnut basin 

Relationship to CAS/CPF 

20. The World Bank Group’s Strategic Country Diagnostic (SCD) for Senegal identifies four main constraint areas to 
inclusive growth and equity, three major constraints to the sustainability of this inclusive growth and two underlying 
institutional constraints (see diagram). Summing up, the constraints and solution areas identified by the SCD delineate 
three main pathways to poverty reduction and increased shared prosperity in Senegal.  

• Boosting Senegal’s Competitiveness to ensure a dynamic private-sector led growth and capitalize on the growing 
young urban population by focusing on reforms of the fiscal and monetary frameworks and improvements of the business 
environment as well as measures aimed at an increased and equitable availability of productive inputs, such as skills and 
land, and improved critical infrastructure, including energy and ICT.  

• Enhancing Equity and Resilience unlocking the economic potential of non-extractive natural resources, including 
agriculture and livestock, from which most of the poor still derive their livelihoods, while enhancing the ability of the 
population in rural areas to engage in the growth process and cope with shocks through appropriate government support 
allowing for the accumulation and protection of their asset base.

• Managing Risks Associated with Natural Resources by addressing the perils inherent in the nascent oil and gas 
sector, particularly the ‘resource curse’ and potential erosion of the competitiveness of labor-intensive exports, as well as 
diverse impacts of the climate change, threatening to erase years of progress in poverty reduction.  

21. The proposed Program aligns well with the three pathways outlined in the SCD and the World Bank Groups’ 
Africa Region’s Climate Change Business Plan, in particular the one on ‘Enhancing Equity and Resilience’. While the 
Country Partnership Framework is being developed, it is likely that it will be consistent with the proposed pathways which 
all echo the priority areas of the proposed Program. By fusing its intervention on climate change adaptation, the Program 
also   contributes to the Region’s climate change business plan. 

 
C. Program Development Objective(s) (PDO) and PDO Level Results Indicators 

 
Program Development Objective(s) 

22. The Development Objectives of the proposed Program are to improve the competitiveness of the groundnut 
value chain and to increase the resilience to climate and market risks of farmers and herders in the Groundnut Basin.  

    PDO Level Results Indicators 
 

23. At PDO-level the following indicators are proposed to assess the Program’s results: 

(i) Number of farmers/herders reached with climate-smart agricultural practices and technologies (e.g. drought 
resistant varieties, new seeds/feedstocks for crop diversification; soil and land management practices and 
technologies); 

(ii) Increase in yields of groundnuts and selected crops; 
(iii) Increased exports of high value crops (shelled groundnuts and horticultural produce); 
(iv) Reduced variability in production of groundnuts and selected crops. 

 
D. Program Description 

 
PforR Program Boundary 

1. Government program objectives and results 

24. The objective of the Government’s updated agriculture program as set in the LPDSA is “to develop a performant, 
competitive, diverse and sustainable agriculture that provides stable income to farmers and promotes economic and social 
development”.  This is further broken down into four specific objectives, five programs and 15 lines of activities:  

(i) Increased agricultural production and productivity with the following activities. This objective aims to 
sustainably increase agricultural production and productivity through diversified and qualitative products, able to 
meet the consumption needs of the population, to provide raw materials for the domestic processing industry 
and to be competitive in international and regional markets;  
(ii) Diversified agricultural production systems. This objective aims at developing diversified agricultural value-
chains, taking full advantage of the various agro-ecological zones of the country, in order to give rural populations 
more income opportunities, in particular through increased support to high added-value agricultural value-chains;  
(iii) Strengthened agricultural services framework. This objective aims at developing agricultural and rural 
research, training and advice, facilitate farmers’ access to finance and creating a regulatory environment 
conducive to private sector investments;

(iv) Improved agriculture sector governance facilitating the dialogue between all relevant stakeholders to ensure 
an efficient implementation of the sector’s development policies 

2. Proposed Program for Results operation context 

25. The proposed Program will contribute to the government’s programs addressing the volatility of agricultural 
production and farmers revenues, while positively impacting longer term productivity in the Groundnut Basin, and is 
anchored within PSE’s vision regarding the development of the agriculture sector, and its sectoral program’s (PRACAS) 
objectives. In agreement with the GoS, the proposed Program would focus mainly on the Groundnut Basin, the traditional 
area for peanut production that is lagging behind in terms of development. The proposed Program will focus on areas of 
intervention identified in Senegal’s agriculture development strategy that are key to addressing the high vulnerability of 
farmers to climate and market risks and improving the competitiveness of the groundnut value chain.   

26. The proposed Program will support the economic transformation of agricultural households, in particular through 
the supply, through public and private entities, of quality agricultural services. Two different trajectories have been 
identified to achieve that purpose: (i) the diversification of family farms through increased technologies adoption and 
digitalization and (ii) the creation of jobs opportunities along agri-food value-chains of high commercial potential. 

27. The approach will consist in putting the private sector8 at the heart of the proposed Program’s interventions. For 
that purpose, the proposed Program would support the GoS’s efforts in establishing a favorable environment for the 
development of private sector, via the pursuit of reforms initiated in the agri-food sector, the institutional strengthening 
of dedicated organizations and targeted public investments to improve the factors of competitiveness (e.g. productive 
and market infrastructures, research and development, agricultural extension, quality management…). 

28. Given the vulnerability of the country’s agricultural sector to climate change, particularly in the targeted areas of 
intervention (Groundnut Basin), the proposed Program would carry-out several activities to achieve climate Co-Benefits. 
The proposed Program aims at enhancing the adaptation of production systems to climate change (mainly increase in 
temperatures and reduction in rainfall) and to strengthen the resilience of farmers to climate shocks. This will be achieved 
through better management of water resources with improved irrigation systems, the adoption of climate-smart 
technologies and climate-resilient crops, and higher integration of agriculture and livestock production systems. The 
proposed Program also aims at achieving climate Co-Benefits by reducing GHG emissions. It will promote climate-smart 
agricultural and husbandry practices, favor restoration of soil to allows greater carbon absorption, and reduce food losses 
and waste through increased connectivity of farms to markets and improved storage and processing capacity.  

Results areas 

29. To achieve its development objective, the proposed Program would focus on three results areas: (i) increased 
productivity and diversification to strengthen resilience, (ii) increased market access, and (iii) sector governance, 
coordination and programs management private sector development. Those results areas have strong synergies and are 
mutually supportive. 

30. Result area 1: Increased productivity and diversification to strengthen resilience. The proposed Program would 
aim at developing solutions to mitigate the risks that farmers face in the targeted areas of the Program, in particular 
market and climate-related risks.  

• Development of the agricultural resource base in the Groundnut Basin. The Program would aim at strengthening 
the sustainable use of natural resources the agricultural sector relies on. In particular, the Ministry of Agriculture 

                                            
8 In the context of the Program “private sector” includes all type of entrepreneurial activities, from smallholder’s farms, to cooperatives, small and 

medium agri-business enterprises, national and multinational agri-food industries…

and Rural Equipment (MAER) and the Ministry of Livestock and Animal Resources (MERA) would closely 
coordinate with the Ministry of Water on ongoing assessments of water resources for an integrated and 
sustainable use of existing resources, in order to scale up efficient water and soil management programs in the 
Groundnut Basin. Those would include use of existing water infrastructure or the development - where 
conditions for sustainability so allow - of small scale water infrastructure to expand efficient irrigated systems in 
the Groundnut Basin, improvement of livestock watering points, the rehabilitation of degraded land/soil through 
investments and building capacity of farmers and herders on water and soil management infrastructure and 
techniques. The proposed Program would also enhance knowledge management on the state of these natural 
resources (water, soil, climate) in the Groundnut Basin.  

• Strengthening family farms’ productivity and resilience. The proposed Program would support the 
transformation at scale of part of the rainfed dependent family farms to more resilient, irrigation-based 
diversified farming systems. Both the development of irrigation and the diversification of production systems in 
the Groundnut Basin would allow farmers to reach higher labor productivity and full employment all year long. 
Furthermore, better water management through access to irrigation as well as adoption of climate-smart 
technologies would improve the resilience of farmers to climate-related risks, reducing their exposure to 
droughts. Based on ongoing analysis of the agricultural and livestock resources base in the Groundnut Basin, 
MAER and MERA will assess during the Program’s preparation, value-chains, business models and business 
alliances, which the proposed Program will help expand, through technical assistance, training, and investments. 

• Facilitating access to improved seeds. Access to adapted and productive panting material is a prerequisite for 
successful development of modern farms. This result would be achieved through increased availably of breeder 
and foundation seeds from the research system and efficient seed multiplication system. The Program would 
support development of a market-driven, private-sector-led seed multiplication system to disseminate quality 
seeds adapted to climate change, notably the new breeds recently released in Senegal and West Africa under 
the West Africa Productivity Program (WAAPP). The national agronomic research institute (ISRA) and public 
institutions (e.g. MAER’s Division of Seed control) would be strengthened in their role on breeder seed 
production and seed quality control.  

• Insuring commercial herders and farmers against shocks. The Program would support the expansion of the 
ongoing agricultural index-based-insurance scheme9 to address residual production risk and reduce the 
incidence of systematic shock on farmers’ and herders’ revenues. The insurance program would be part of a 
package of support to project beneficiaries aimed at accelerating uptake of improved technologies and adoption 
of good farm management practices, and de-risking access to credit. The Program’s support on insurance could 
be coupled with ongoing social protection programs such as the Government “Bourses Familiales” and upcoming 
World Bank Social Protection program to ensure that poorest and non-insurable households in the Groundnut 
Basin are provided with the adequate instrument to emerge from climate related disasters, with emergency 
relief and the provision of assets to re-start production cycles. 

31. Result area 2: Increased market integration. The proposed Program aims at strengthening the links between 
agricultural production and other segments of the value-chain, promoting inclusive business alliances, removing critical 
impediments (physical impediments as well as capacity building) to promote the development of private-sector-led 
services and agro-industries along the value chains.   

                                            
9 Index based Insurance was been introduced in Senegal with WBG support since 2009, but its development has been very slow until recently with 

increased interest from the private sector and contract farming in the groundnuts value chain. See more on the design of the product in “The World 

Bank : Index-based Crop Insurance in Senegal – Promoting Access of Agricultural Insurance for Small Farmers. Sustainable Department-Africa Region,

• Structuring farmers associations and promoting contractual farming. This result area would focus on the 
improvement of storage, processing and marketing of agri-food products so as to improve the connection of 
production systems to the agro-industry and markets in general. The proposed Program would (i) identify and 
support business models strengthening the links between producers and agro-industries, (ii) support the 
development of farmgate small scale crops and animal feed/fodder storage facilities, as village aggregation 
centers and cottage processing center within the production areas to facilitate linkages with off-takers;  

• Increasing control of aflatoxins and fruit flies. The proposed Program would tackle these major hurdles to access 
to markets for key produces which could otherwise develop rapidly in the Groundnut basin, such as 
confectionery groundnuts, maize for animal feed, and exportable mangoes10. The Program would support (i) the 
dissemination of appropriates technologies to control aflatoxins on groundnuts and maize along the value chain; 
(ii) the Department of Plant protection (DPV) to extend the coverage of areas infested by the fruit flies; (iii) the 
strengthening of the quality control system for agri-food products on aflatoxin and fruit flies. 

• Supporting the emergence of Agropole-Centre. While large scale infrastructure, such as roads, power plant and 
construction of manufacturing or industrial processing facilities are excluded from PforR financing, the proposed 
Program may support the feasibility studies for the Agropole Centre, which aimed at addressing critical 
impediments to the development of processing and marketing of agricultural products. In parallel, the Program 
would support the construction and rehabilitation of small-scale rural infrastructure such feeder and connecting 
roads, aggregation/storage and processing parks in and/or around selected economic poles. The Program would 
ensure climate-resilience of implemented investments. 

32. The World Bank and IFC teams are working closely in the preparation of the proposed Program and will further 
deepen the collaboration during implementation to promote private investments in agricultural value chains and facilitate 
access to domestic and international markets. Specific areas of collaboration could include the extension of the warehouse 
receipt systems to value chains of interest for the groundnut basin (groundnuts, and animal feed crops such as cowpeas 
and maize), agricultural finance including insurance, and structuring contract farming between producer associations, 
traders/aggregators, agro-processing companies and exporters. 

33. Result area 3: Improving sector governance, coordination and programs management. The proposed Program 
would address the policy and markets failures that prevent efficient private sector development in the agri-food sector, 
focusing in particular on the groundnut value chain which development has been affected by inefficient interventions. The 
Program would also support the strengthening of the organizational and institutional environment to facilitate the 
development of diversified and resilient agri-food value-chains and improve coordination and execution of government 
programs in the agriculture sector. 

• Improving the policy environment for production, processing and marketing of agri-food products. The Program would 
focus on implementing key reforms to create an efficient and conducive environment for private sector development 
in agri-food value chains. This include (i) implementing the policies and activities defined in the Groundnut sector 
strategy (Note d’orientation pour le Développement et l’Optimisation des Performances de la Filière Arachide- Draft 
May 2018), (ii) establishing a more targeted – both in terms of beneficiaries and technologies focusing on climate-
smart agriculture- and cost-efficient inputs and mechanization support program, (iii) setting up a permanent public-
private sector dialogue on the agricultural sector, strengthening quality control and improving governance of 
government’s inputs subsidy programs, (vi) implementing a conducive fiscal environment for the development of 
agro-processing, and (vii) implementing sustainable financing of agricultural services (research-development-
extension) and facilitating access to finance for productive activities.

• Program Performance tracking, Sector coordination and capacity building. To accelerate the implementation of key 
reforms in the groundnut sector and implementation of investments supported by the proposed Program there is a 
need for capacity building and institutional strengthening. Key capacity building efforts under the Program would be 
directed at (i) selected inter-professions to enable them to carry out their mandate and become effective and inclusive 
platforms for intra-branch coordination and public-private dialogue, (ii) the Ministry of Agriculture (MAER) and its 
regional directorates to strengthen its ability to plan and coordinate different stakeholders and projects in 
implementing the second phase of PRACAS; (iii) national institutions in charge of data collection, treatment and 
analyses (MAER-DAPSA, DHORT, PAPA, DRD, MEFP-ANSD, PM-BPE) to improve their capacities to inform policies and 
monitor implementation programs; (iv) national organizations and institutions providing business development and 
technical support services to the agri-food sector; (v) authorities and laboratories ensuring quality control  of 
agricultural inputs and food products (DPV, CERES-Locustox, ITA, LCI) in particular for the control of aflatoxins and 
fruit flies (vi) national institutions in charge of monitoring natural resources (soil and water) management and 
infrastructures. 

E. Initial Environmental and Social Screening 

34. It is assumed that the proposed Program by its nature will yield significant positive environmental and social 
benefits by promoting climate-smart agriculture, soil restoration, reduction of food losses, improved water management, 
etc., while its environmental and risk from  the promotion of PRACAS and PNDE, of increasing yields, developing 
infrastructure (such small catchment dams/weirs, retention basins, cattle watering points, crop and fodder storage 
facilities, cottage processing platforms, etc ), use of chemicals, will be limited. Interventions proposed for the Program’s 
support exclude activities which normally would be considered as Category A under Investment Financing Projects. For 
this reason, the proposed Program for Results is not considering heavy infrastructure on irrigation or infrastructure 
necessary to establishing a full Agropole, such as power plant or connection to high voltage power grid and connecting 
roads. Furthermore, intervention on irrigation will not consider transfer of significant flow of groundwater for irrigation 
development, but rather small-scale irrigation around existing water infrastructure or small-scale infrastructure such as 
catchment weirs and boreholes fit for purpose. Environmental and social impacts of such infrastructure would be limited 
in scope and manageable. Implementation of some investments may require acquisition of land or displacement of 
people, even though affected people during construction may also be ultimate beneficiaries of such investment. Regarding 
land acquisition, the structure of farming systems in the Groundnut Basin, overwhelmingly dominated by small scale family 
farming holdings, and the high population density prevent distribution or acquisition of massive amount of land for 
agribusiness operations, which in any case the project cannot support. Therefore, the proposed Program’s approach 
consists of developing targeted value chains around family farming.  

35. Although the Program will strive to promote climate friendly agriculture, agricultural intensification including 
agroforestry, drought-tolerant and salt-tolerant varieties, crop diversification, efficient soil and water management 
techniques) may involve increased use of chemicals for soil fertilization and for plants diseases, weeds and pest control. 
For instance, the control fruit flies on fruit crops and may involve use of pesticide at a significant scale or acquisition of 
advance technology to produce sterile males of ceratitis.    

36. Ministries of agriculture and livestock have long-standing experience of managing World Bank operations and are 
relatively well familiar with the Bank's guidelines and procedures on environmental and social risks management, but 
mostly through dedicated projects implementation units with qualified and competitively selected staff. As part of the 
Program's preparation, the Bank task team will prepare an environmental and social systems assessment (ESSA). The ESSA 
will review existing regulations and policies, their legal and practical applicability at the program level, institutional 
capacity, and the effectiveness of implementation in practice, using empirical information and data to be provided by the 
GoS and supplemented with information from other stakeholders and other available sources. The ESSA will include 
measures required to manage environmental and social impacts and risks and will include actions to strengthen 
institutions and increase the capacity of the whole program.

Other Decision (as needed) 
 
 

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 
1. Malawi is a small, peaceful and democratic country, with a population of about 17 million people. Most of the 
population (85 percent) lives in rural areas. Population growth rate is estimated at 2.8 percent per annum. At this growth 
rate, Malawi’s population is expected to reach 23 million by 2025. The country is land-locked and is highly vulnerable to 
climatic shocks. Despite a recent difficult economic period, Malawi has a stable democratic political system and has 
initiated economic and political reforms. The country remains one of the world’s poorest, with over half of its population 
living in poverty.  

2. Malawi has a narrow export base consisting mostly of tobacco, with high dependence on imports and external 
aid flows. Investment climate constraints hinder private investment. The 2018 Doing Business report ranks Malawi 111 
out of 190 on the ease of doing business.  The main obstacles to doing business include poor infrastructure and services 
such as electricity, water, transport, an uncertain economic environment, poor legal and regulatory framework, lack of 
access to long-term finance and a limited skills base. Business confidence remains subdued following two years of 
drought conditions and weak economic growth. 

3. Poverty levels in Malawi are high. In 2017, poverty headcount at US$1.9/day (2011 PPP) remained stubbornly 
high at 70 percent of the population1. Gross National Income (GNI) per capita2 was estimated at US$320 in 2017. Malawi 
is ranked 170 out of 188 countries on the United Nations Human Development Index, and 125 out of 157 on the World 
Bank’s Human Capital Index. Almost half (47 percent) of the children under age five in Malawi are short for their age 
due to long-term effects of malnutrition and 20 percent are severely stunted.   Malawi’s economic growth rates have 
fallen below the average of 2.8 percent in non-resource rich African economies during the last twenty years.  Real per 
capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has grown at an average of just above 1.5 percent per year between 1995 and 
2014.  With these persistent low growth rates, successive governments in Malawi have struggled to lift people out of 
poverty.   Wealth accounting data3 shows that more than half of Malawi’s wealth (estimated at US$10,442 per capita in 
2014) is renewable natural capital, mainly cropland with smaller shares contributed by pastureland, forests and 
protected areas. The natural capital base however is under extreme pressure due population growth, agricultural 
expansion and climate change. There is also a strong correlation between areas with highly degraded land and those 
with a high incidence of poverty, although there is currently insufficient evidence to point to a causal link4.

4. Natural resources underpin Malawi’s productive sectors and are the main source of livelihood for over 80 
percent of the population.  For instance, the agriculture sector contributes 28 percent of Malawi’s GDP and 78 percent 
of export earnings, and employs 64 percent of the workforce, which consists mainly of subsistence farmers. Smallholders 
account for 80 percent of agricultural production and 70 percent of agricultural GDP.  The forestry sector contributes 
6.2 percent to the GDP (and this does not account for the value of non-wood forest products, processed timber or the 
enormous informal trade in wood fuel and charcoal). Some 33,000 jobs are heavily dependent on the existence of 
Malawi's forests.  Forests provide a range of environmental services, such as GHG mitigation, watershed regulation, 
climate regulation, soil and water conservation, biodiversity support and nutrient cycling. The nine protected areas in 
the Shire river basin store an estimated 80 million tons of CO2e5.  Malawi is also heavily dependent on hydropower for 
its energy needs, with about 98 percent of current electricity generation coming from run-of-river6 hydropower plants 
on the Shire River. 

5. Agriculture remains the lifeblood of Malawi’s economy, and growth in GDP has historically followed growth in 
agriculture.  However, most of the population is engaged in smallholder, low-productivity rain-fed agriculture which 
regularly suffers exogenous climate-induced shocks with significant negative impacts on overall growth and poverty 
reduction. In recent years, weak fiscal policy, low investor confidence, significant weather shocks and land degradation 
have had detrimental effects on agricultural output and food security.  Malawi regularly suffers from droughts and 
floods, and its economic growth is closely correlated with hydrological variability. In recent years, the country has 
suffered from weather shocks with increasing frequency, including both floods and droughts in early 2015, followed by 
another major drought in 2016. Irrigation potential has not been fully developed. Only about four percent of crop land 
is currently irrigated, severely constraining agricultural intensification and commercialization. 

6. Medium-term economic prospects however appear positive as the country recovers from the recent weather-
induced shocks in 2016. Real GDP growth after two consecutive years of drought, fell below three percent in 2016 but 
is projected to pick up in the range of four to five percent over the next two years. Increased output is expected to be 
driven by a rebound in the agriculture sector, although this outlook is susceptible to downward risks such as a potential 
El Niño-induced weather shocks.  The continued vulnerability of Malawi’s agricultural sector and spillovers to other 
sectors point to the critical need to promote measures that improve resilience.  The Government of Malawi (GoM) has 
recently developed a medium-term strategy7, looking beyond the recent crisis, to establish strong foundations for a 
productive, competitive and resilient nation. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
7. Malawi’s water resources are under threat from severe land degradation and loss of forest cover.  Critical 
watersheds are becoming degraded leading to reduced water availability, deteriorating water quality, increased 
vulnerability to droughts and floods, reduced energy security and reduced agricultural productivity. Malawi has a large 
network of surface waterbodies covering about 21 percent of the country’s total area; about 20 percent of this area is 
Lake Malawi itself.  Malawi’s drainage system is divided into 17 Water Resources Areas (WRAs)8. Major river systems 
include Shire (WRA 1), Ruo (WRA 14), Linthipe (WRA 4), Bua (WRA 5), Dwangwa (WRA 6), South Rukuru (WRA 7), North 
Rukuru (WRA 8) and Songwe (WRA 9).  Most of the rivers are subject to natural seasonal flows but maintain at least 
some base flow (at least in their lower reaches) throughout the dry season. The total renewable water resource available 
in Malawi is estimated at 17.3 km3/year, or 1,027 m3/capita/year.  While availability of water resources in the aggregate

6 ‘Run-of-river’ means that there is little or no storage capacity upstream of the power plant except small pondage for peaking. The amount of 
electricity that can be produced depends on the daily flow of the river.  
7 Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (2017-2022) 
8 A Water Resources Area is essentially a single large, or in some cases a collection of smaller, hydrological catchments.

is considered satisfactory, per capita water availability has been declining at a rapid rate.  Malawi is now dangerously 
close to becoming water scarce9. Further, water resources in Malawi are highly variable between wet and dry seasons 
and from year to year, and the country’s stock of water storage infrastructure is one of the lowest in the region. GoM’s 
Water Resources Investment Strategy (WRIS, 2011) identifies poor catchment conditions and deteriorating water quality 
as significant risks to water resources and associated infrastructure (dams, hydropower plants, irrigation systems), and 
recommends investments in catchment management in strategically important WRAs.     

8. Land degradation10 in Malawi’s most important watersheds has reached alarming levels, with major impacts on 
water security, agricultural productivity, and hydropower generation.  Recent studies suggest that land degradation 
hotspots cover about half (41 percent) of the land area in the country11. Soil erosion and nutrient depletion are major 
forms of land degradation that are reported to affect more than 60 percent of the entire land area. The average annual 
national soil loss rates in 2014 was 29 tons per hectare12. Chemical land degradation, including soil pollution and 
salinization/alkalization, has led to 15 percent loss in the arable land in Malawi in the last decade alone. Projections for 
future land degradation and soil loss under different climate and population growth rate scenarios suggest that land 
degradation will become increasingly severe, with one study suggesting that overall rates of soil loss will increase by 
between three and four times 2010 baseline levels13. The Shire River Basin (WRA 1) remains the most prominent hotspot 
of land degradation. High loads of sediment are deposited in river beds, reservoirs and floodplain wetlands, affecting 
irrigation canals, fisheries and hydropower generation.  Existing hydropower plants on the Shire River are often unable 
to meet peak demand, partly due to low flows and sediments in the river caused by degradation of catchments upstream 
of the plants14.  

9. Forest degradation is a major contributor to land and water resources degradation.  Over the last 40 years, more 
than half of Malawi’s forests and woodlands have vanished and those that remain are being ‘thinned’ through over-
extraction and more frequent forest fires. Yet, forests make a substantial contribution to livelihoods and the economy 
and are needed to protect vital ecosystem services. They also provide the bulk of Malawi’s energy supply in the form of 
charcoal and firewood.  Wood fuels dominate Malawi’s energy sector and are used by 98 percent of the population. The 
industry provides large numbers of jobs and is worth nearly US$295 million per annum – equivalent to four percent of 
GDP15.  Forests and woodlands also play a key role in protecting watersheds from erosion, sustain the biodiversity that 
underpins a large proportion of Malawi’s tourism sector and make an important contribution to mitigating carbon 
emissions.   

10. The underlying drivers of land degradation in Malawi are well known. These include a growing demand for 
agricultural land due to increased population pressure and reduced agricultural productivity; insecure land tenure which 
reduces incentives to invest in soil and water conservation measures; and limited access to markets and rural finance. 
The proximate causes of land degradation include a wide range of biophysical factors and poor land management

practices. Important biophysical factors that affect land degradation include topography, land cover, climate and soil 
erodibility.  

11. Efforts to address land degradation are hampered by a multitude of factors.  The major challenge is the weak 
institutional capacity for natural resource management at both national and local levels and the severe lack of funding 
for these activities in local government budgets. With insufficient resources, weak capacity and incentives, local 
governments are generally unable to play an effective role in addressing land degradation at the local level. In addition, 
changes to climate and weather patterns exacerbate the impacts of natural resources degradation, making it harder to 
address the problem.  Future climate change scenarios suggest that Malawi will see increasing climatic variability, higher 
temperatures, longer dry periods, and more erratic and intense rainfall events16. More intense flood events will cause 
greater soil erosion and land degradation. Hotter and drier periods will contribute to forest fire risks. Droughts will 
continue to negatively impact food production, causing food insecurity and increased poverty. Increased poverty results 
in greater demand for agricultural land, thus exerting more pressure on the natural resources base.  Yet, Malawi remains 
unprepared to anticipate, respond to and recover from the effects of climate change.  The country lacks reliable hydro-
meteorological information that is needed for building climate resilience.  For example, out of the 140 hydrological 
monitoring stations in Malawi that are considered a priority, 70 percent are not operational.  Systems for data storage 
and quick relay to modelling and forecasting systems are either non-existent or not integrated across agencies. Building 
a national and more integrated hydrometeorological service is key to building climate resilience across productive 
sectors and reducing pressure on the natural resources base.  

12. Reversing the rate of land degradation remains a government priority. The Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and 
Water Development (MoAIWD) and the Ministry of Natural Resources, Energy and Mining (MoNREM) recognize the 
interdependence between natural resource management, agricultural production, water and energy security. Sound 
policies and institutional frameworks for natural resources management exist. A new Environmental Management Act 
2017 has been enacted to strengthen environmental management and protection, while the Water Resources Act of 
2013 provides for the management, conservation, use and control of water resources, including management of 
watersheds.  

13. The recent establishment of the National Water Resources Authority (NWRA)17 is expected to help strengthen 
multi-sectoral planning and management of water resources in the country, and pave way for establishment of 
sustainable watershed management institutions at the community level. Land reforms introduced in 2016 are 
expected to improve land tenure security and strengthen incentives for small-holder farmers and businesses to invest 
in sustainable land and water management practices. Further, a new National Charcoal Strategy has been approved, 
which for the first time, provides an opportunity to legalize the charcoal value chain and move towards more sustainable 
charcoal production, and thus reducing pressure on forests and community woodlands. However, the ability to 
implement policy and legislation, both nationally and locally, remains weak.  Monitoring is often limited and ineffective, 
compliance is low and the structures necessary for providing guidance and procedures are not in place. Weak 
institutional capacity is particularly acute at district and local levels, partly because of the slow pace of decentralization 
and severe under-funding18 which constrains the effective functioning of institutions at district and local level, limiting 
their ability to implement policy. 

14. To reverse landscape degradation and protect watersheds, Malawi needs to invest at scale in the protection of 
renewable natural resources and their restoration where appropriate and cost-effective, using a broad suite of

17 GoM recently appointed the governing board for NWRA – a move that is seen as an important milestone in operationalizing the institutional 
framework for water resources management as laid out in the Water Resources Act of 2013.  
18 For instance, the share of agricultural spending on extension support – a critical service for promoting the uptake of SLM practices –reduced 
from 25 percent in 2005 to just 5 percent in 2012.

interventions. These will include sustainable forest management and restoration interventions, development of water 
management infrastructure, scaling-up of climate smart agriculture and resilient livelihoods. At the same time, GoM 
needs to invest in strengthening institutions and improving the monitoring, management and use of hydro-
meteorological information.  GoM’s National Forest and Landscape Restoration Strategy (NFLRS), published in July 2017, 
proposed that land restoration should be elevated to a higher national priority level, backed by financial investment to 
implement a large scale national program for land restoration. In this regard, GoM has committed to restore 4.5 million 
hectares19 of landscape by 2030, through a combination of interventions, including soil and water conservation, river 
and stream bank restoration, conservation agriculture, farmer-managed natural regeneration and agroforestry; natural 
forest management; community forests and private woodlots. The total cost of achieving this target is estimated at 
US$385 million (or US$86 per hectare). GoM is currently in the process of mobilizing finance from development partners 
to support implementation of the strategy, either through a new large scale national program or a series of separate 
programs targeting major river basins 20.    

15. One such program which GoM has been implementing since 2012 with World Bank support is the Shire River 
Basin Management Program (SRBMP) 21. Part of the investment under SRBMP targets degraded hotspots in the basin 
covering a total area of 129,500 ha (about 5 percent of the basin land area). These catchments have been undergoing 
rehabilitation over the past two years with promising results.  Available data shows that a total of 35,385 ha (i.e. 27 
percent of the targeted catchment area and 1.3 percent of the entire basin) has been rehabilitated, including 10,173ha 
of previously degraded community forests which have been regenerated. Vegetative protection measures have been 
implemented on 4,000km of water courses (rivers and streams) in the targeted catchments. Various infrastructure 
packages–rural feeder roads (80km), bridges (11) and markets (13)–designed to support alternative livelihoods and 
improve market access have been completed and commissioned. A total of 366 Common Interest Groups (CIGs) have 
been established, trained and provided with start-up capital for various non-farm business enterprises.  Finally, a total 
of 80 Farmer Field Schools (FFS) are now promoting conservation agriculture and improved farming practices using a 
farmer-to-farmer extension approach. To date, about 77 percent of households within the targeted catchments are 
reported to be engaged in sustainable land and water management.  These results, although achieved at a small scale, 
have demonstrated that it is possible to restore degraded landscapes through an integrated package of interventions 
involving land and water management, forestry management and livelihood support.  GoM would like to scale up these 
interventions in other degraded hotspots in the Shire River Basin and elsewhere in line with the national landscape 
restoration strategy. The proposed Resilient Productive Landscapes Project (RPLP) has been conceived in response to 
GoM’s letter of request for World Bank support dated June 28, 2017. 

 
Relationship to CPF 

 
16. The project is aligned with the new growth-oriented Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Malawi which is 
currently under preparation. The CPF focus on four themes which emerged from the Systematic Country Diagnostic 
(SCD).  These are: (i) human capital; (ii) governance and macroeconomy; (iii) energy and infrastructure; and (iv) 
environment and rural resilience.  The project contributes to the environment and rural resilience theme by addressing 
land degradation, improving natural resources management and boosting agricultural productivity.  Addressing these 
issues will contribute to protecting critical watersheds and securing water resources for existing and proposed 
hydropower plants on the Shire river as well as the large-scale irrigation scheme currently under implementation as part 
of the Shire Valley Transformation Program.   

                                            
19 This represents about half of the entire land area in Malawi 
20 So far, GoM has developed and is implementing two river basin management programs – Shire River Basin Management Program supported by 
the World Bank and the Songwe River Basin Management Program – supported by African Development Bank 
21 Current World Bank support to SRBMP ends on January 31, 2019

17. The project is also expected to contribute to the human capital agenda in Malawi. A recent study22 found that 
upstream watershed conditions were a strong predictor children’s health across 35 developing countries, including 
Malawi.  Specifically, the study found that in areas with no access to improved water sources, higher upstream tree 
cover is associated with lower probability of diarrheal diseases downstream, even after controlling for socio-economic 
and climate factors23. This suggests that improving watershed management is not only an investment in environmental 
resilience, it is also an investment in public health. 

18. The project responds directly to GoM’s priorities as laid out in the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy 
(MGDS III) 2017-2022.  The objective of the strategy is to move Malawi to a productive, competitive and resilient nation 
through sustainable agriculture and economic growth, energy, industrial and infrastructure development while 
addressing water, climate change, environmental management and population challenges.  The project contributes 
directly to the MGDS III priority areas of agriculture, water development and climate change management by supporting 
investments that address land degradation and its impacts on water resources, agricultural productivity and rural 
resilience.  Given the critical role water plays in Malawi’s economy, and given that the country’s wealth is still largely 
dominated by natural resources (largely cropland), future growth will depend on reversing land degradation to improve 
productivity, and sustainable management of natural capital (especially forests) to protect water security.     

19. The project also contributes to the WBG’s twin goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared 
prosperity. The project area targets the poorest region of Malawi, where rural poverty rates are above 80 percent.  A 
recent study24 shows a strong correlation between areas with highly degraded land and those with a high incidence of 
poverty, implying that increasing levels of land degradation may be contributing to the poverty of millions of Malawians. 
The project will contribute to reversing this trend.

5. Operationalization of the National Water Resources Authority 

 
D. Concept Description 

 
22. The proposed project responds to Malawi’s most pressing environmental challenge – severe degradation of the 
renewable natural resources base (land, forests and water resources) that underpins the productive sectors of the 
economy.  The project’s central thesis is that degradation of the renewable natural resources base and high exposure 
and vulnerability to climate change have adversely affected energy and water security, agricultural productivity and 
livelihoods.  The project will contribute to breaking the cycle of degradation in selected watersheds and reducing climate 
vulnerability by (i) strengthening the institutional enabling environment for landscape management at the national, 
local and community level; (ii) investing in productive landscape management and livelihoods in targeted watersheds; 
and (iii) improving hydrometeorological information and services for resilience.  Intervention in these three areas is 
expected to result in increased adoption of resilience-enhancing landscape management practices, which would 
ultimately contribute to improving water and energy security, agricultural productivity and livelihoods.   

23. The proposed project will support GoM’s National Forest and Landscape Restoration Strategy (NFLRS). The 
overall objective of the NFLRS is to restore degraded landscapes for improved water and energy security, agricultural 
productivity and livelihoods. The project will contribute to achieving this objective by investing in restoration activities 
in selected priority watersheds, while at the same strengthening institutions and information for resilience and 
sustainability. Proposed project activities will be organized under five components as outlined in the following 
paragraphs.  

24. Component 1 – Institutional capacity strengthening.  This national level component will finance a package of 
activities designed to strengthen the institutional and policy framework for integrated landscape and water resources 
management at national, district and local levels and will also support the development and piloting of a Payments for 
Ecosystem Services (PES) mechanism for the Shire river basin that could deliver longer-term financing for efforts to 
address land degradation and protect natural resources that generate ecosystem services.    

25. Component 2 – Landscape management and livelihoods support. This component will finance an integrated 
package of interventions designed to protect environmental services and restore degraded landscapes in selected 
watersheds in ways that will also build resilient livelihoods. The component will support: 

• Sustainable land and water management (SLWM) interventions that will focus on catchment planning, river 
and streambank management; and soil and water conservation.  The approach will be based on the successful 
participatory approach tested under SRBMP and codified in the new national guidelines on integrated 
catchment management; 

• Agriculture and resilient livelihoods interventions that will support climate smart agriculture practices to 
increase the resilience of both farmers and landscapes. Support for livelihood diversification through stronger 
engagement with the private sector will also be encouraged; 

• Forestry and protected areas interventions that will be delivered in the context of the NFLRS and will focus on 
strengthening the management and productive contribution of existing natural forests in both state-managed 
forest reserves and on customary land, and protected areas. Forest reserves and protected areas comprise a 
large proportion of the upper part of the landscape, play a key role in protecting ecosystem services and offer 
cost-effective opportunities for avoid the need for costly restoration of natural resources; and

• Development of water management infrastructure will focus on small-scale investments for harvesting, 
storing, and delivering water for people, livestock and agriculture. The menu of water infrastructure 
investments will include small-to-medium dams, small sand and sub-surface dams in dry river beds, area 
infiltration interventions such as semi-circular bunds or soil bunds, and rock catchments. The component 
could also support rehabilitation and/or construction of boreholes for groundwater extraction. Diversification 
of water sources in each target watershed will increase the supply of water for multiple use and therefore 
mitigate against the risk of droughts. 

 
26. Component 3- Hydro-meteorological monitoring and climate services improvement.  This component will invest 
in the expansion and modernization of Malawi’s hydrometeorological monitoring network and associated data 
management and decision-support systems. It will also support the integration, efficiency and scaling up of climate 
information services.  It will support Malawi’s efforts to establish a National Framework for Climate Services (NFCS) 
through investments in the entire value-chain of climate products and services. This component will complement an 
ongoing Green Climate Fund-supported initiative by extending geographical focus to cover southern Malawi and by 
strengthening development of digital solutions.  

27. Component 4–Project management support. This component will finance a package of project management 
support activities to ensure cost-efficient, timely and quality delivery of project activities and results, and will include: 
(i) establishment of a project management support unit with specialized project management professionals to provide 
support to the lead implementing ministry/department and the multi-sectoral technical team; (ii) incremental 
operating costs for day-to-day management of project activities at the national and district levels; and (iii) support to 
multi-sectoral coordination and implementation at the district and local levels.   

28. Component 5 –Contingency Emergency Response. A Contingency Emergency Response Component (CERC) with 
zero allocation will be created and made implementation-ready to allow the GoM to respond quickly in case of an 
eligible emergency. The CERC will complement those in place already under agriculture and nutrition projects and the 
forthcoming Malawi CAT DDO.   The mechanism will be defined in a specific CERC Operational Manual that will clearly 
outline the triggers, eligible expenditures, procurement thresholds, and procedures for using part of IDA resources of 
the project to respond quickly in the event of an eligible emergency. 

29. The project will use, where appropriate, community‐led landscape approaches—that is, an integrated approach 
to sustainably manage natural resources for multiple purposes and functions. Managing natural resources in an 
integrated way across different land uses and connecting them at the landscape level provides the basis for addressing 
trade‐offs and enhancing people’s livelihoods and resilience to climate variability and change.  In the context of the 
project, the operational boundaries of the landscapes are those of the watersheds or micro-watersheds targeted by 
the project.  The project area will include a total of 500 micro-watersheds located in the degradation hotspot areas of 
the Shire River Basin (upper and middle Shire), averaging approximately 500 hectares each.  This includes a total of 305 
micro-watersheds supported under SRBMP and a total of 195 new micro-watersheds to be selected in the upper and 
middle reaches of the Shire river basin, upstream of existing and proposed hydropower plants.  The watersheds 
supported under SRBMP will continue to receive support to allow for full implementation of the watershed 
management plans (or Village-Level Action Plans).  These watersheds will also receive technical assistance to graduate 
from project-based support, including establishment of catchment management committees, in accordance with the 
Water Resources Act 2013.   

30. The estimated cost of the proposed project is US$125 million.  It is proposed to finance this cost through an IDA 
credit of US$120 million and a GEF grant of US$5 million. The final project financing structure will be decided in 
consultation with MoFEPD.

Summary of Screening of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts 

Project subprojects have not been identified, however screening of potential environmental and social 
impacts has been undertaken on similar subprojects. Possible risks and impacts that are likely to arise from 
some of the proposed subprojects include construction related health and safety risks to both labour and 
local communities; possible influx of populations and the social risks associated with that such as disease 
transmission and spread of HIV, potential for Gender Based Violence; and land acquisition leading to 
temporary or permanent physical displacement and loss of assets, land and livelihoods. Environmental risks 
include those related to civil works construction (controlling on-site erosion and pollution), localized changes 
in water use and distribution. unregulated wood cutting in areas with improved road access (absent adequate 
control measures), potential damage to patches of natural habitat (such as miombo woodland or dambos), 
and possibly increased agro-chemical use.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 

1. Uganda has made significant progress in economic growth and poverty reduction over the last 30 years, 

rural poverty remains a major challenge. Following policy reforms that allowed market liberalization and led to 

political stability, Uganda registered high economic growth between 1987 and 2010, with Gross Domestic 

Product (GDP) averaging 5.1 percent1 in the last five years. The structure of the Ugandan economy has also 

undergone a major transformation during the same period, with a notable shift from a primarily agriculture-based 

economy to one dominated by services and industry. In 20152, the service sector became the largest contributor 

to GDP (52.8 percent), followed by agriculture (25.8 percent) and industry (21.4 percent), respectively. In line 

with its economic growth, the country achieved remarkable results in poverty reduction, cutting extreme poverty 

by half, between 1993 and 20063. The recent National Household Survey has however showed an increase in 

poverty from 19.7% in 2012/13 to 27% in 2016/17. The main poverty challenges are food insecurity, low 

agricultural productivity, a degrading natural resource base, inadequate planning for the rapid urbanization and 

low access to basic infrastructure and services.  

 

2. Agriculture has been a key driver of economic growth and poverty reduction in Uganda, irrigation 

development is essential for food security and agriculture transformation. As Uganda’s largest single economic 

sector, generating about one quarter of GDP and employing 70 percent of the labor force, agriculture plays a 

critical role for income generation, employment and livelihoods, particularly for the bottom 40% of the 

population, as well as overall economic development. In spite of the gradual decline in its GDP contribution, 

typical of transforming economies, agriculture remains the key source of exports contributing 80% of total 

exports. The agriculture sector supports over 80% of the poorest of the population, the rural areas account for 

94% of the poor, and 85% of the population. This demonstrates the high potential multiplier effect of agricultural 

growth on the socio-economic development of the country. Irrigation development which is now very limited in 

the Uganda is essential to increase agricultural productivity, manage the increasing climate risks and enable

commercial cultivation in the country. In recognizing the critical roles of irrigation, the government in the Vision 

2040 and NDP II (2016-2020) lists irrigation investment as a high priority along with agricultural value-chain 

development. The goal is to transform the small-holder subsistence cultivation into modern commercial farming 

to increase production, productivity and farm income.  
 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 

3. The regulatory framework for irrigation in Uganda is generally aligned with international good 

practice although detailed implementation regulations and management institutions require strengthening.   

The Water Act (1995) provides the institutional framework and legislation for water resources management, 

irrigation, water supply and sanitation. The National Water Policy defines the responsibilities of different entities 

in water resource development, promotes water resource assessment and planning for irrigation, and calls for 

increasing the capacity of the farmers to access and use water for crop, fishery and livestock production. The 

Water Resources Management Reform Strategy (2005) provides for decentralized water resources management 

at the zone and basin levels. On the agricultural side, the 2010 National Agricultural Policy (NAP) stipulates the 

sectoral approach to the National Development Plan, emphasizes the need for rehabilitating government irrigation 

schemes, transferring the management responsibility of irrigation schemes to lowest appropriate levels, 

establishing new irrigation schemes, and increasing water storage for livestock and wildlife. The Agriculture 

Sector Strategic Plan (2015/16-2019/20) includes strategic interventions to increase access to water for 

agricultural production. The National Irrigation Policy (2017) lays out the guiding principles and general 

institutional arrangement for irrigation development and management, including coordinated planning, 

implementation, and service delivery, as well as cost recovery and beneficiary participation through water user 

associations (WUAs). The policy recognizes the role of farmers managing small-scale schemes, and encourages 

a community-based irrigation management approach. The National Irrigation Master plan (MWE 2011-2035) 

stipulates the priority irrigation development areas and schemes over short, medium and long terms.  

 

4. Irrigation, also called water for agricultural production (WfAP), is a shared responsibility between the 

Ministry of Water and Environment (MWE) and the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries 

(MAAIF). MWE takes overall responsibility for irrigation and off-farm irrigation development while MAAIF for 

water use and management of on-farm agricultural water facilities. Horizontal and vertical coordination is often 

lacking. Overall policy guidance to the water subsector is provided by the Water Policy Committee, comprising 

members from relevant sectors. Technical guidance to the sector is provided by the cross-sectoral Water and 

Environment Sector Working Group (WESWG), which includes recommendations of budget and programs, and 

sector performance assessment.   

 

5. Agriculture and irrigation are performing well below their potentials.    Uganda has a diverse agricultural 

production system primarily based on small-scale manual subsistence farming, and comprising a system of mixed 

agriculture with perennial and annual crops in most of the seven agro-ecological zones. The main crops are cereals 

(maize, sorghum, millet, rice) on some 1.7 million ha for the two cropping cycles out of the total 14.4 million ha 

agricultural area: root crops (25%), banana (17%), as well as pulses, oil seeds, coffee, vegetables and fruits. Export 

crops include coffee, tea, tobacco, cotton, cut flowers, and cocoa. Food crop production dominates the agriculture 

sector, contributing over 55% of the agricultural GDP, while cash crops contribute 17% and livestock 15%. 

Despite the dominance of food crop production, one third is marketed with export being less than 7%. The sector 

is seeing a trend of moving towards higher-value crops (perennial and seasonal) such as Tea, Cocoa, fruits etc.,

Uganda Irrigation Modernisation Project (P163836) 

 
 

  
Nov 27, 2017 Page 5 of 18  

     

with more clear commercial and export orientation.  

 

6. Agriculture is mainly rain-fed with only 1.3% of total cultivated land under irrigation over a potential of 

1.1million ha (AICD/IFPRI, 2010) and 3.0 million ha (NBI 2012). Therefore, the sector is very vulnerable to 

climate change and variability. According to the 2017 National Food Security Assessment and IPC, around 31 

percent of the population was food insecure (in January 2017) and this deterioration was partly due to the drought 

conditions caused by the 2016/17 El Niño and La Niña climatic events. This highlights the inadequate climate 

resilience of agricultural production and farming communities. The crop yield and productivity in the country are 

well below their potentials, for example, the yield of maize in the country is around 2.4 tons/ha while in some 

parts of world farmers could easily produce with irrigation, 10-15 ton/ha of maize. The main contributing factors 

found by different studies are lack of reliable water supply (irrigation), quality of production inputs, poor 

extension services and little value-chain development. As a result, food insecurity and malnutrition as well as 

very low agricultural income are still major challenges for the country. Many households suffer from food 

insecurity and high levels of malnutrition, with 34% of children under 5 years being stunted. The most food-

insecure region is the North, followed by the East, in terms of dietary energy consumption. In the North, 59% of 

households consume only one meal per day. The number of food-insecure people in Uganda is projected to rise 

from 7 million in 2015 to 30 million by 2025. 

 

7. Irrigation development is still at preliminary stage in the country. To date, a total of some 15,000 ha of 

public small scale irrigation schemes (largest 600-800 ha) has been developed, mostly in the form of valley tanks 

and river diversion schemes. The government ministries are responsible for scheme construction, and once the 

schemes are completed farmers operate the schemes. There is no dedicated irrigation management authority and 

the irrigation service concept is not fully developed. Irrigation water charge is being exercised in some places. 

Operation and maintenance of irrigation schemes have been essentially informal until in the past few years when 

farmer-based irrigation management through WUAs and farmer cooperative societies were piloted under AfDB 

funded irrigation rehabilitation project, which has mixed results. Negligence and deferred maintenance are 

common phenomena, management capacity at national, district and scheme levels is rather limited, sustainability 

of the existing schemes are questionable. 

8. The Government has developed a strategy for irrigation development and management.     The NDP II 

(2016-2020) and the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) both recognize investment in irrigation as one of the 

keys to the country’s transformation. The NDP II Objectives related to irrigation include: increasing production 

and productivity along the value chain; addressing challenges in selected thematic technical areas including 

critical farm inputs, mechanization and irrigation; improving agricultural markets and institutional strengthening 

for agricultural development. Institutional strengthening is crucial, alongside investments in rural infrastructure 

and markets, farmer aggregation in producer associations and agricultural extension systems, to support the shift 

to higher-value agricultural production. The government has committed itself to increasing agricultural growth to 

6 percent per year and allocate at least 10 percent of the budget to the agricultural sector. In order to address the 

irrigation development and management challenges, the government has formulated an irrigation development 

strategy. The strategy includes the following key elements: (a) boosting irrigation infrastructure development 

investment through difference sources; (b) promoting integrated planning and coordinated implementation among 

irrigation, agriculture and related sectors; (c) rolling out the National Irrigation Policy and detailed 

implementation regulations; (d) developing  irrigation management institutions and farmer water user groups 

(WUAs) as well as service charge based cost recovery mechanisms for sustainable irrigation service delivery; and 

(e) strengthening agricultural support services through different pathways, including public service delivery,

farmer-based cooperatives/enterprises and partnership with the private sector. The 2017 National Irrigation 

Policy sets an ambitious target of total irrigated area of 400,000 ha by 2040, with the objectives of achieving 

national food security, transforming the agriculture sector and significantly increasing agricultural income, 

through increasing production and productivity, improving drought-resilience of farming communities, and 

investing in agricultural value-chain development. To implement the above strategy, the government requested 

the World Bank to support its irrigation development agenda with focus on irrigation infrastructure development, 

irrigation management institution development and value-chain development.  

 
Relationship to CPF 

 

9. The CPF of the World Bank Group for the Republic of Uganda for the period of FY16-21 responds to the 

Government of Uganda vision of a transformed society from a peasant economy to a modern and prosperous 

country by 2040, and its interim goal to attain middle income status by 2020 as described in the second National 

Development Plan (NDP II). The CPF is designed to contribute directly to achieving the Sustainable Development 

Goals, focusing on three strategic areas: (a) strengthening governance, accountability and service delivery; (b) 

Raising incomes in rural areas; and (c) boosting inclusive growth in urban areas. 

 

10. The proposed project, marked as an FY19 lending operation, directly supports the Strategic Focus Area B 

of the CPF: Raising incomes in rural areas, by increasing agricultural productivity, improving the climate 

resilience of the poor and vulnerable farming communities. The project aims to modernize both the physical 

infrastructure system (including technology) and management and service institutions, required for sustainable 

irrigation services and agricultural transformation. This is well aligned with the GoU’s Vision 2040 and 

agricultural development strategy.  
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 

11. Program Development Objective:   The proposed program development objectives are to improve 

financially sustainable irrigation and drainage services, and increase farmers’ agricultural revenue in the project 

areas. The objective will be achieved through a phased investment program to be implemented over 10-12 years, 
with each phase focusing on one or two priority region(s). 

 

12. Proposed (Phase 1) Project Development Objectives:   The development objectives of the project are 

to develop irrigation and drainage infrastructure and services, and institutional capacity for irrigated agricultural 

production in the project areas. The schemes under Phase 1 will focus in one or two regions such as southwestern 

and northern regions. 

Key Results (From PCN) 

 

13. The key results (PDO) indicators for Phase 1 Project would likely include the following: (a) Farmers/Area 

provided with new/improved irrigation and drainage infrastructure services (no./ha); (b) Operational WUAs 

established or strengthened (number); (c) farmer cooperatives or organizations established or strengthened 

(number); (d) Change in crop intensity; and (e) Irrigation service fee established.

D. Concept Description 
 

14. Project concept and overall approach:    The proposed project will adopt a programmatic approach, 

based on the strategic vision that sustainable irrigation infrastructure operation and services depend upon 

helping farmers turn agriculture into a profitable business. The overall thinking is that reliable and affordable 

irrigation infrastructure and services enable high agricultural production and productivity leading to increase in 

farmer household income, that will enable farmers to pay for the irrigation and associated support services, and 

invest in high-value cultivation including value-chain development; and such investments demand high quality 

services to achieve the expected returns and foster a virtuous cycle of irrigated agriculture development. In view 

of the time required to complete the above development cycle, a three bite-sized program through a series of 

projects (SOP) is conceived for the proposed operation.  

 

15. The Program would be implemented over a period of 10-12 years. It targets a total irrigated area of some 

25,000-35,000 ha at a cost of US$400-500 million directly benefiting some 200,000 small and medium sized 

farmers (tentative, assuming an average 1 ha landholding for a household of six) in the water stressed areas with 

high development potential and/or where there is significant food insecurity issues. Phase 1 project will lay the 

foundation for the subsequent phases. Each phase will have different focus on infrastructure, institutions and 

productivity/income. Each phase prepares follow-up investments for the next phase, while every phase aims to 

bring the project objectives of the previous phase to a new level. Funding sources of the Program beyond Phase 

1 would be more diverse including possible private sector investments. The program focus, phasing, and coverage 

are shown in the Annex. 

 

16. Project Design Guiding Principles and Scheme Selection Criteria:  The project design will follow the 

guiding principles below: (a) integrated investment planning and joint preparation; (b) complementarity and 

synergy with related (agricultural) investment programs; (c) institutional design to ensure sustainability of project 

facilities and service delivery, with adequate arrangements, capacity building for cost recovery and user/private 

sector involvement; and (d) simple project design with adequate implementation readiness before approval.  

 

17. Project Composition:    The proposed Phase 1 Project at an initially estimated cost of US$150-200 

million, will have three components, i.e. irrigation infrastructure development, essential support services for 

agricultural production and value-chain development, and institutional strengthening including implementation 

support. At this stage, the project is estimated to develop some 10,000 ha of new irrigated area, directly benefiting 

around 60,000 poor small to medium farmers. The component description and indicative costs are as follows:   

Component 1.  Irrigation infrastructure development (US$175 million):   The objective of this component is to 

develop the irrigation and drainage infrastructure primarily for supplemental gravity irrigation services. It will 

finance construction and equipment for the water source works (storage reservoirs, river diversion weirs and 

pumping stations), related catchment management interventions, and three to five irrigation systems (including 

main canal and drainage system, cross structures, on-farm works, and operation and maintenance (O&M) 

facilities), associated resettlement and environmental management costs. It will also finance consultancies for 

scheme feasibility studies, designs and safeguards assessments including for the follow-up investments. The 

schemes are likely to concentrate on southwestern and northern regions. This is in view of the promising 

commercial production prospect (southwestern) and high drought-vulnerability and severe food insecurity 

(northern), and very importantly implementation readiness for a successful first phase. Scheme selection will be 

guided by the GoU irrigation master plan and groundwater option considered where adequate studies exist.

Component 2.  Essential support services for agricultural production and value-chain development (US$15 

million):   This component aims at filling critical gaps in provision of essential support services for crop 

production and value-chain development.  It will include strengthening farmer groups/cooperatives for better 

access to quality inputs and appropriate technologies or practices with the aim of improving production and 

productivity. It will also support value chain development and market linkages to increase the value of traded 

items for better economic gains to the target population. The interventions will largely involve retaining experts 

for diagnostic assessments and for imparting knowledge and skills to the beneficiary communities; and provide 

financial support in form of credit or matching grants towards investment in produce storage facilities and value 

addition technologies. Interventions under this component will be complementary to the ongoing agricultural 

development operations by the government and other development partners, such as the Bank-financed 

Agricultural Cluster Development Project (ACDP), the Millennium Village Project (MVP), and the EU-funded 

Common Market for East and Southern Africa (COMESA) initiative. The approach to be adopted for this 

component would be consistent with that followed by the ACDP for improving farmer access to quality 

agricultural inputs and post-harvest handling.  

Component 3.  Institutional Strengthening and Implementation Support (US$8 million):  This component is 

intended to strengthen irrigation management institutions through technical assistance and capacity building and 

implementation support. The institutional strengthening will finance: (a) consultancies for irrigation regulations 

and guidelines development, and necessary supporting studies (e.g. irrigation water tariff) for implementing the 

national irrigation policy; (b) consultancies and training for formulation and capacity building of irrigation 

management organizations for irrigation service delivery and system O&M , including management entities and 

farmer irrigation water users associations (WUAs); and (c) training and consultancies for skills development for 

staff at national, district and scheme levels including beneficiary communities and farmers, in irrigation policy 

and regulations, irrigation technology and management, and agricultural water management. Implementation 

support will include technical and project management consultancies, necessary facilities (goods) and incremental 

operating costs for project implementation management.  

18. Lessons learned and considered in the project design:  The lessons learned from irrigation and irrigated 

agriculture operations supported by the Bank and other development partners in Uganda and elsewhere, which 

will be incorporated in the project design include the following: 

(a) Sustainable irrigation investments require development at adequate scale and support over a sufficiently 
long period to break the vicious cycle of irrigation (or irrigated agriculture) development; 

(b) Project design (complexity) should be compatible with the client capacity and development stage in the 
sector. The general implementation performance of Bank-financed agricultural operations in Uganda has 

been significantly below expectation, and therefore warranting a simple and realistic project design;  

(c) Integrated irrigation and agricultural investment planning, preparation, implementation and operational 
management are crucial prerequisite to successful irrigation projects;  

(d) Institutional design for irrigation operations should cover the entire project cycle. Participation of 
beneficiary communities through water user groups in irrigation system O&M and service delivery is 

essential for sustainable operation. Private sector involvements in irrigation and agricultural supporting 

services can enhance service delivery efficiency and performance;  

(e) Farmer-based irrigation scheme management arrangements have limitations particularly for larger 
schemes as reflected under the Uganda’s irrigation rehabilitation projects and other management models 

(options) need to be explored for managing the project schemes;

(f) The project related social and environmental risks are adequately assessed and used to inform and 
influence the project design, and a robust institutional mechanism put in place for resettlement and 

safeguards risk management during implementation; and 

(g) Project implementation readiness at appraisal is critical for smooth implementation and timely completion 

19.    The proposed project will be implemented by the Ministry of Water and Environment (MWE). The 

Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fishery (MAAIF) will be involved in implementation of Component 

2. The district local governments (DLGs) and local communities at the locations of the project schemes will 

participate in implementation of different components. A project steering committee (PSC) chaired by the 

permanent secretary for water, and comprising senior officials from MAAIF and related ministries and districts, 

will be established to provide strategic directions, policy guidance, and high-level coordination. The existing 

project management unit (PMU) of MWE with experienced project management, procurement and safeguards 

staff, will function as the PMU for overall project management and coordination, and the secretariat to the PSC. 

An integrated implementation team comprising technical, agricultural and institutional staff from national and 

local government will be established at each location for execution of scheme-specific activities.    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The schemes are likely to concentrate on southwestern and northern regions. This is in view of the promising commercial 

production prospect (southwestern) and high drought-vulnerability and severe food insecurity (northern), and very 
importantly implementation readiness for a successful first phase. Scheme selection will be guided by the Government of 
Uganda (GoU) irrigation master plan and agreed selection criteria and process. Groundwater option shall be considered 
where adequate studies exist. As described in the project concept note, the project will finance construction of 20-30 m 
high storage dams on rivers and other water source works, several large scale new irrigation and drainage canal systems 
each with 1,000-4,000 ha of command area, as well as catchment management and agricultural water management and 
essential supporting services. Significant resettlement and labor influx are anticipated at some project schemes although 
land redistribution is not required. The project is expected to boost agricultural productivity through crop intensification 
and diversifications as well as value chain development. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
Although the ministry of water and environment (MWE) as the implementing agency for the project has substantial 

experience in implementing World Bank funded projects and have overall social and environmental safeguards capacity, 
the envisaged project implementation unit (Directorate of Water Development, DWD) may require capacity 
enhancement. As such, a project management unit (PMU) will be established in the ministry's liaison department which 
has long years of experiences in managing water infrastructure projects financed by the Bank, to augment DWD’s capacity 
to manage the project. At District/Local Government level, there are District and Community Development Officers whose 
Safeguards Capacity will be enhanced as appropriate. A comprehensive safeguards capacity assessment of the project 
implementers will be carried out as part of the formulation of safeguards instruments and where necessary, 
enhancement measures will be proposed and implemented before project activities start.

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The project involves a number of interventions and 
investments such as large-scale irrigation 
infrastructure. Typically the irrigation infrastructure 
works will occur over a large area of some 10,000 
hectares in Phase 1 (25,000 – 35,000 hectares over 3 
phases) and may lead to large scale environmental and 
social impacts, affecting a wider area, and resulting in 
significant health and safety impacts, including labor 
influx and associated socio-economic aspects. Because 
of this, the project has been assigned EA Category A. 
This Category A project is preparing two independent 
Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) 
for the planned Nyimur (North East) and Kabuyanda 
(South West) schemes, which will respectively cover 
approximately 2,741 and 3,663 hectares, under Phase 
1 project. Civil works will include construction of dams 
20-30 meters high and associated reservoirs, and 
establishement of irrigation systems in the command 
areas. The studies will also include Environmental and 
Social Management Plans (ESMP), Pest Management 
Plans (PMP) for the priority schemes. During 
preparation of ESIAs for the individual sub-projects 
sites, Cumulative Impact Assessment will be part of 
the assessment and appropriate mitigation measures 
captured in the ESMPs for implementation. The ESIAs’ 
preparation has included extensive stakeholder 
consultations, which will continue after the ESIA 
reports are publicly disclosed and during project 
implementation. Since these two ESIAs are 
deliberative, their findings (including impacts) shall be 
included in the Appraisal ISDS after clearance by the 
RSA and disclosure by both the Bank and GoU. Since at 
this stage only two irrigation schemes shall be 
subjected to ESIAs and RAPs, Environmental and Social 
Management Frameworks (ESMFs) will be drafted to 
guide the mitigation of impacts for schemes whose 
detailed designs are to be completed during 
implementation stage. They will include an annex with 
an Environmental and Social Screening form for sub-
project activities under component 1.. The 
Frameworks will also cover auxiliary facilities which

are normally not covered under the first set of 
ESIAs/RAPs, and these shall include guidance on 
acquisition, operation and management of facilities 
such as workers’ camps, equipment storage areas, 
material sites, waste management sites, etc. The 
ESMPs will include environmental rules for contractors 
that cover site-specific technical specifications, Labor 
Influx Management Plans, Labor Camp Management 
Plans, Code of Conducts for all construction personnel, 
and recommended penalties for non-compliance. 
These ESIAs and ESMPs will demonstrate how the 
project would comply with all applicable rules and 
guidelines, including: (i) all triggered World Bank 
Safeguard Policies; (ii) relevant World Bank Group 
Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines; (iii) 
World Bank guidance on Managing the Risks of 
Adverse Impacts on Communities from Temporary 
Project Induced Labor Influx; (iv) Guidelines on the 
establishment of a functioning Grievance Redress 
Mechanism (GRM); (v) World Bank Africa Region’s 
Interim Guidelines for Safeguards Application in 
Agricultural Water Management Projects; and (vi) 
Uganda National Environment Management 
Authority’s (NEMA) Guidelines for Environmental 
Impact Assessment and Environmental Auditing for 
Irrigation and Drainage Operations. In addition, a 
Stakeholder Engagement/Communication Plan will be 
drafted during project preparation to ensure that two 
levels of consultations are carried out  with adequate 
involvement of all stakeholders, including women and 
members of vulnerable groups. These Plans will serve 
as a tool for having an open and continuous 
communication with the affected communities. The 
communications strategy will be updated to include 
measures to address specific issues related to labor 
influx that will be explored by the social assessments, 
such as child labor, harassment of any sort, safety and 
security, gender-based violence (GBV), Sexual 
Exploitation and Abuse (SEA), HIV/AIDS and so on. 
 
The ESIAs and RAPs, including ESMPs and PMPs for the 
priority schemes and the framework instruments 
(ESMF and RPF) will be cleared and disclosed in-

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

  

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

The project is designed to minimize any adverse 
impacts on natural habitats as a result of irrigation 
development, while strengthening the management of 
vulnerable catchment areas. This policy is triggered 
because irrigation development will take place in 
wetlands and river areas and may have an impact on 
the remnants of natural habitats, both downstream of 
the command area, and in the catchments where 
deforestation and land clearing activities may be 
carried out. It is, however, expected that no 
environmentally sensitive habitats will be significantly 
converted under this project, rather environmental 
conservation will be encouraged at the project sites. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

The policy is triggered because of envisaged potential 
impacts on forest habitats as a result of dam 
construction and water collection/harvesting and 
delivery systems. Detailed information on site specific 
impacts on forests will be provided in the ESIAs to be 
prepared for the different project sites and 
appropriate mitigation actions included in the 
respective ESMPs. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The policy is triggered due to potential expansion, 
intensification of agricultural activities, and 
diversification into new crops that often require more 
frequent usage of combinations of agro-chemicals. A 
generic Pest Management Plan (PMP) will be prepared 
as part of the ESMF and disclosed by appraisal. Where 
use of pesticides will be anticipated, site specific PMPs 
will be included in the respective ESIAs. The PMPs will 
be adopted and included in the project 
implementation manual to address pest management 
issues that may arise in project sites due to both area 
expansion under irrigation and expected increase in 
pesticide use associated with productivity 
improvement. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

The policy is triggered as construction activities may 
lead to opportunistic finds of archaeological artifacts 
and/or may have an impact on graves and other 
cultural sites. Chance find provisions will therefore, be 
included in construction contracts while potential 
impacts on other identified physical cultural resources 
will be addressed by site-specific environmental 
management plans (EMPs).

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 

This policy is not triggered because none of the people 
within the planned project area meet the specific 
criteria under which indigenous peoples are defined in 
OP 4.10. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

This policy is triggered because of anticipated impacts 
under component 1, which objective is to develop the 
irrigation and drainage infrastructure (primarily for 
supplemental gravity irrigation services) and finance 
construction and equipment for the water source 
works (storage reservoirs, river diversion weirs and 
pumping stations), related catchment management 
interventions, and three to five irrigation systems 
(including main canal and drainage system, cross 
structures, on-farm works, and operation and 
maintenance (O&M) facilities), associated 
resettlement and environmental management costs. 
These activities may trigger land acquisition and 
involuntary resettlement as land requirements for 
purposes of construction of any of these facilities may 
permanently or temporarily limit access to both public 
or private land and other assets by local communities. 
The areas envisaged to be used as reservoirs for both 
priority schemes are currently used by a few PAPs for 
residence and farming while the rest is utilized by 
community members for growing perennial crops, 
hunting, gathering, apiary and fishing. 
 
Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) are being prepared 
for the two priority schemes and will be disclosed by 
project appraisal. For those where the scope and other 
details of works, including the exact locations of the 
infrastructure within each project site are not yet 
determined, a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) 
will be prepared and disclosed both in country and on 
the World Bank’s external website before project 
appraisal. 
 
In addition, some land consolidation might be required 
for some of the irrigation schemes and particular 
attention will be given to the process through 
extensive and inclusive consultations with affected 
communities to ensure that potential changes in 
ownership and land tenure are adequately addressed;  
All RAPs will be required to explicitly describe the 
modalities of these processes.

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

The policy is triggered because of the project will 
finance construction of dams. In compliance with the 
triggered OP 4.37, a Dam safety panel is being 
constituted to provide the necessary oversight. The 
irrigation dams will be designed by qualified 
engineers, and dam safety measures will be 
incorporated in dam operations. Dam Safety plans for 
the proposed large dams (including an Emergency 
Preparedness Plan (EPP)) will be drafted, reviewed, 
endorsed and disclosed. For small dam construction, 
rehabilitation, and maintenance relevant oversight 
procedures will be included in the Project 
Implementation Manual. Kabuyanda scheme will 
iinclude construction of a 25m high dam, while the 
total number of dams to be constructed under each 
phase of the Program is not yet known at this stage. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 

This policy is triggered by the Project as it will 
contribute to building infrastructure and enhancing 
the environment for irrigated agriculture in selected 
high potential sites across the country during project 
implementation that may have an impact on riparian 
water sources. Irrigation schemes under the proposed 
project may be located on rivers which are tributaries 
to international waterways such as the River Nile. The 
relevant notifications per the requirements will be 
sent to Riparian countries before appraisal. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
All of the territory within the program undisputedly 
falls within Ugandan territory. Therefore this policy is 
not triggered. 

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Jan 31, 2019 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Safeguards related studies (ESIAs, RAPs, and PMPs) for two priority schemes (Kabuyanda and Possibly Nyimur schemes) 

and the safeguards policy framework (ESMF and RPF) will be completed by Project Appraisal in August, 2018; Other 
scheme-specific ESIAs, RAPs, PMPs and the Cumulative Impact Assesment will be completed during early stage of project 
implementation.

20. The project is expected to trigger the following safeguard policies: OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment, 

OP 4.04 Natural Habitats, OP 4.09 Pest Management, OP 4.36 Forests, OP 4.37 Safety of Dams, OP 4.11 Physical 

Cultural Resources (TBD), OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement, and OP 7.50 Projects on International Waterways.  

 

21. The project shall be required to prepare two sets of Safeguard Instruments – Policy Frameworks and 

Specific Instruments which include: Safeguard instruments for the project include (a) environmental and social 

impact assessments (ESIAs); and (b) environmental and social management framework (ESMF), (c) resettlement 

action plan (RAP), and (d) resettlement policy framework (RPF). The implementation agencies for the proposed 

Project is the Ministry of Water and Environment (MWE) responsible for overall implementation and 

Components 1, 3 and 4. The implementation agency has long experiences in preparation and implementation of 

safeguards policies and instruments under Bank funded projects in the water sector.  

 

Citizen Engagement and Gender Mainstreaming 

22. Community involvement and stakeholder consultation are essential for the success of the Project, and will 

be sought throughout the project cycle from conception to operation. In the course of scheme selection and design, 

the local communities and stakeholders will be engaged to ensure that the project investment benefit the poor and 

vulnerable of the population. They will also be involved in defining the irrigation services and identifying critical 

gaps in essential support services for crop cultivation and value-chain development, and engaged in discussions 

on resettlement action planning and implementation, irrigation service fee and scheme operation. Detailed 

consultation and mapping will be carried out with different community groups, particularly with the vulnerable 

groups including women and minority groups, on project intervention section, and value-chain development 

through matching grant (or credit), and so on. 

 

23. Gender analysis will be undertaken as part of the scheme-specific environmental and social impact 

assessment, and grievance redress mechanism included in the environmental and social management plan. During 

implementation, the farming communities will be required to take lead and organize themselves into farmer 

producer cooperatives for agricultural production and business development. The communities will also organize 

themselves into farmer water user associations (WUAs). The WUAs will be empowered to manage irrigation 

water distributions and participate in the system operation and maintenance. NGOs and/or consulting firms will 

be contracted to facilitate the process, and make sure that women and vulnerable groups are adequately 

represented in the cooperatives, enterprises and WUAs. Appropriate citizen engagement and gender 

mainstreaming indicators will be included in the project results framework for monitoring purpose.   

 Climate Risk Screening 

 

24. In general, Uganda is well endowed with water resources with per capita annual renewable water resources 

of over 2,000m3. However, the aggregate figures mask bot temporal (seasonal) and spatial variability, which 

translate into significant geographical differences in water availability. According to a study of MWE in 2009, by 

2035, 3 out 4 districts will be under high water stress. The main climate risks in the country are droughts and 

floods. Flood prone areas are generally located along rivers and major water bodies, wetlands and low lying areas. 

Floods in the past decades have caused severe infrastructure and property damages, community displacement and 

crop losses in different parts of the country. 

 

25. In contrast to floods, droughts are more pervasive, frequent and widespread in the country. In the recent 



 
The World Bank

Nov 27, 2017 Page 17 of 18  

     

past, droughts have led to chronic food shortages and livestock deaths in various parts of the country, affecting a 

significant percentage of the population, particularly in the north, northeast, and the ‘cattle corridor’, where the 

rainfall tends to be highly variable from year to year. Drought impacts have been exacerbated by the lack of 

adequate water management planning and water infrastructure (e.g. water storage and irrigation/water supply 

facilities) to manage climate variability and risks. 

 

26. Building on earlier climate change vulnerability assessment and adaptation strategy studies for Uganda’s 

water sector, a further study was carried out in 2011 as part of the Bank’s country water assistance strategy for 

Uganda, to analyze the historical climate trends and future climate scenarios. All the models project increased 

warming and more ‘hot’ days in the future. There is very strong model agreement that mean annual precipitation, 

runoff, preparation during extreme storm events, and precipitation intensity will increase in Uganda. These results 

are consistent with other related studies such as the climate change impacts on Africa crop production under 

CGIAR’s program on climate change, agriculture and food security (Remirez-Villegas, J., Thornton PK, 2015). 

Both studies point to likely increase in temperature and evapotranspiration, and rainfall leading to potentially 

more frequent extreme weather events.    

 

27. In the process of project conception, an initial climate screen was undertaken using the dedicated climate 

resilience screening tool. To adapt to such projected climate change and variability, the Project will include as 

part of the design the following interventions: (a) water storage for schemes in areas where the water availability 

in the water sources are highly variable, this will be accompanied by necessary catchment management activities 

to ensure long term sustainable operation; (b) cost-effective soil and water conservation, and climate-resilience 

measures, particularly water-saving technologies and on-farm water management practices will be included to 

reduce crop water demand, evapotranspiration and GHG emission; (c) water balancing and supply reliability 

assessment will be undertaken during project feasibility study in the basin/aquifer context to ensure sufficient and 

reliable irrigation water supply; and (d) all the project infrastructure will be designed with sufficient flood 

protection, taking into consideration the climate change and variability factor.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 
1. Ethiopia is a large, landlocked, and diverse country. It is the 11th poorest country in the world by 
income per person, and home to Sub-Saharan Africa’s second largest population of about 92 million people, the 

vast majority of which are rural dwellers. The natural resources base remains the foundation for most 

livelihoods, and is subject to considerable climate risks. Despite past progress, a historic legacy of 

underinvestment still bears its mark as more than half of the adult population is illiterate and the country’s 

infrastructure deficits remains one of the largest in the world. Ethiopia is undergoing a faster demographic 

transition than the rest of Africa and the rapidly rising working-age population presents opportunities as well as 

challenges. 

 

2. Ethiopia has experienced a sustained period of rapid economic growth and progress towards the 
achievement of Millennium Development Goals (MDG), however it retains a very high poverty rate, high levels 

of chronic under-nutrition and continued vulnerability of households and communities.  The “development 

state” model, put in place following the overthrow of the repressive military regime in the early 1990s, has seen 

high levels of government-led investment in infrastructure, a commitment to decentralization of service delivery 

and devolution of authority and some liberalization of the economy.  While these reforms have progressed to 

different degrees, the impacts on the economy have been broadly positive, with strong and generally broad-

based economic growth averaging around 10 percent over the past 10 years.  

 

3. The services and agricultural based economy is relatively stable, but the private sector remains nascent. 
Agriculture accounts for most jobs and about 40 percent of output and exports. Services accounts for close to 

half of output and half of exports. Manufacturing shares of output, jobs and exports have remained stagnant at 

around five percent, but the sector holds the promise of a takeoff. The economy is relative stable though high 

inflation presents occasional challenges. Substantial external deficits arise largely as a result of very low exports 

and high public capital imports. Supported by a system of financial repression and other heterodox macro-

financial policies, Ethiopia has the third highest public investment rate in the world, but the sixth lowest private 

investment rate. This reflects a fledgling private sector with state owned enterprises dominating several key 

services sectors. 

 

4. Albeit from a low base, the country has seen solid progress on a range of human development 
indicators. Poverty in both rural and urban areas has been reduced substantially though remains high by 

international standards, with 78 percent of the population living below US$2 per day. Despite high levels of 

public resources channeled to the sector, the MDG targets for universal primary education would likely not be 

met, though gender parity is on course. With respect to health and nutrition, Ethiopia is on track to reach the 

child mortality, HIV-AIDS and malaria MDGs as a result of the expansion of health infrastructure and service 

delivery systems.  Under-nutrition remains a major challenge: despite reductions, levels of underweight and 

stunted children remain very high, and is prevalent in both food secure and food insecure districts and within all 

but the highest wealth quintile.  

 

5. The vision of the country, as expressed in the Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP, 2009/10 to 
2014/15), and in tvhe Second Growth and Transformation Plan (GTPII, 2015 to 2020) is to reach the level of a 

middle-income economy by 2025.  This is an ambitious goal, and would require the country to move to a higher

growth trajectory and address persistent challenges including ensuring macro-economic stability, the lagging 

quality of social services, the weak capacity of the public sector and encouraging a higher level of private 

investment. Further opening of the economy would be vital to achieve increased productivity and 

competitiveness in the industrial and services sector and to achieve the government’s ambitious plans for 

agricultural transformation.  

 

6. The challenges of moving to higher growth need also to be set in the context of significant external and 
internal risks that may need to be addressed. External economic shocks could impact on growth, including the 

decline in prices for export commodities, while issues with neighboring countries could increase domestic 

instability, including tensions with Eritrea, instability in Somalia and South Sudan, and the on-going water 

related dispute with Egypt.  Internally, vulnerability to natural disasters, mainly drought, would continue to 

undermine development efforts, with trends suggesting an increase in rainfall variability. 
 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
7. The agricultural sector remains a dominant sector in Ethiopia and contributes significantly to economic 
growth. Although the Ethiopian economy is undergoing a structural transformation, (from agriculture to 

services), agriculture comprises 45 percent of total output and employs 78 percent of its labor force. In addition, 

the sector is a major contributor to export earnings, with over 80 percent of goods exports (including coffee). 

Despite its declining share in the economy, the agriculture sector is growing rapidly. Based on official statistics, 

the sector grew on average by 7 percent per year over the past 15 years. Although there is debate about the 

reliability of these figures, with some studies showing a slower growth rate, there is consensus that the sector 

grew at fast pace over the past decade. The key sources of growth include: (1) increased area under cultivation; 

(2) increased productivity, largely driven by large public investments in agricultural extension and rural roads 

among others, and (3) some advances in public policy including improvements in land tenure security. In 

addition to contributing to economic output and exports, agricultural growth correlates with poverty reduction 

through positive impacts on farming and non-farm rural economies.  

 

8. Livestock (including fisheries) is emerging as a priority focus area for the Government. It is as part of its 
ambitious plans under the GTP2, which would support the country to move towards middle-income status by 

2025. Despite the neglect and lack of attention to date, the livestock sector is seen as significant in achieving 

multiple goals of the government including: (i) contribution to overall economic growth, including an increase 

in the volume and value of exports; (ii) contributing to poverty reduction in both highland and lowland areas; 

(iii) contributing to improved food security and nutritional outcomes for rural and urban households; and 

(iv) supporting the country’s green growth priorities. In this context, the Government has laid the institutional 

and analytical basis for the sector with the creation of the new Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries (MoLF) in 

October 2015, and the recent approval of the Livestock Master Plan (LMP) based on a rigorous Livestock 

Sector Analysis.  

 

9. Ethiopia has 55 million head of cattle, 78 million goats and sheep, 28 million chickens and 5 million 
beehives. It has the largest livestock population in Africa and ranks fifth in the world

1
. In addition, there is 

potential to better utilize water resources to develop the fisheries and aquaculture sector. In spite of this 

potential, food, nutrition and livelihood securities remain a challenge for many households. Approximately 44

.   

 

10. Spurred by population growth, increasing urbanization and incomes, domestic demand for meat and 
dairy products continues to grow. The meat and dairy markets present huge opportunities for business, and 

increasing the availability of animal sourced products can address food and nutrition security challenges in 

Ethiopia. However, key challenges continue to undermine the performance and potential of the livestock sector. 

The sector as a whole is characterized by low production and productivity levels. For example, the average milk 

yield of Ethiopian cows is 1.5 kg per day, which is lower compared to other countries in the region such as 

Kenya (3.6 kg per day) and Rwanda (3.6 kg per day), and significantly lower compared to major milk producing 

countries such as China (7.8 kg per day) and the US (25 kg per day)
3
. Several factors undermine livestock 

productivity and production. Inadequate feeds, poor animal health due to disease prevalence, low livestock 

genetic make-up, weak adoption of improved livestock practices and weak livestock support services are major 

sources of low productivity levels. The public sector dominates livestock support service delivery, and service 

delivery systems for animal health, breeding, feed, finance and extension are weak.   

 

11. Livestock disease incidence is high and to limit its impact, especially economic losses for producers, 
animal health and veterinary services need to work more effectively both in terms of quality of service and 

institutional management. Often rural farmers are underserved -- one health post covers three Kebeles – and 

complain that service provided do not meet their needs. There are over 5000 health staff in the public sector and 

the private sector engagement is limited to urban and peri-urban areas.
4
 There is also dissatisfaction with the 

quality of drugs and vaccines available. The National Veterinary Institute produces 12-17 vaccines for 

transboundary and for some endemic animal diseases. Other vaccines are imported.  Counterfeit and 

substandard drugs are sold next to quality drugs and over 90 percent of animal drugs are imported.
5
 VDFACA is 

responsible for regulation and control of veterinarian vaccines and drugs but is a new agency and building 

capacity.     

 

12. Poor animal nutrition due to feed scarcity, quality and affordability is another key challenge to livestock 
productivity in Ethiopia.  In dairy, only 0.2 percent of cattle holders use improved feed

6
. Limited use of 

improved fodder production and underdeveloped feed preservation practices result in feed shortages in the 

highland mixed crop livestock system, while bush encroachment and rangeland deterioration due to lack of 

sustainable resource management  limit feed availability in pastoral and agro-pastoral areas. Overall, grassland 

coverage of Ethiopian land has been reduced from 30 percent (1980) to 12 percent (2000)
7
. This has 

significantly reduced the amount of roughage available for livestock feed. Extension work in feed has not paid 

significant attention to improved conservation and use of crop residue and by products. In addition, the 

imposition of a 60 percent VAT tax on imported feed pre-mix, concentrates and other inputs combined with 

high custom duties (53 percent) on feed mill ingredients significantly raises the cost of production
8
. These 

factors hinder the use of improved feed and fodder, limiting nutritional health and productivity of livestock.    

 

13. Over 90 percent of Ethiopia’s livestock population is of indigenous breeds (cattle 98 percent and poultry 
95 percent) with low productivity levels. For an average laying period, indigenous chickens lay on average 12

. However, conception rates remain very low (less than 40 percent on average). AI service 

delivery is weak: producers often do not obtain the service at the right time and the NAIC collects and processes 

inadequate semen. There is a need for policy to encourage competition among alternatives AI service providers, 

while the national breeding policy focuses on guiding the choice of breeds and monitor breeding materials.  

 

14. Markets of livestock products are largely unorganized and fragmented. In dairy, only 2 percent of 
marketed milk supplied from the highlands is handled by the organized sector concentrated in urban areas. The 

rest is sold through informal channels, which are characterized by no licensing requirements, limited 

compliance with safety standards and high risks of contamination. For meats, there is inadequate control and 

inspection of abattoirs. Backyard production characterizes the poultry sector, yet the potential of backyard 

poultry remains untapped. Per capita consumption of milk and poultry in Ethiopia are low, compared to those in 

other East African markets
11

. However, Ethiopians regularly consume dairy products
12

, and the projected 

increase in demand in response to population growth, urbanization presents business opportunities in milk and 

meat markets
13

, especially opportunities that can include more women (e.g. milk and poultry).  

 

15. To increase the potential of the livestock product markets, including export of livestock products, 
several improvements are needed including, strengthening market linkages, increasing per capita consumption 

and greater awareness of the nutritional value of milk and livestock products, increasing value addition, and 

improving food safety and quality measures. Most of all, there is a need to rethink the roles of the public and 

private sectors: there is considerable scope to increase private sector investment in production, processing and 

service provision, while strengthening national programs’ capacity and government’s regulatory roles.   

 

16. The main elements justifying increased investment in the sector are as follows: (i) Ethiopia has the 
largest livestock population in Africa, which can be a major asset for economic growth, poverty reduction, 

improved food security and nutritional outcomes; (ii) the livestock sector is underperforming despite its 

enormous potential; (iii) public services to the agriculture sector have prioritized the crop sector over livestock. 

The main service delivery with respect to the feed, animal health and animal breeding has faced systemic and 

operational challenges limiting the sector to develop; (iv) low participation of the private sector in livestock 

sector limits private investments and opportunities for intensification and commercialization. Weak market 

linkages and high cost of basic inputs and low access to appropriate financial products are major features of the 

smallholder livestock systems; and (v) weak institutional capacity throughout the sector, including in private 

and public organizations is a further hindrance to the growth of the sector.  

17. It is in this context that the Government is now giving greater attention to the sector. The  Government 
of Ethiopia has recently completed the LMP, which provides an ambitious vision for the transformation of the 

sector. In view of this, there is a clear and strong rationale to design a livestock project to address the challenges 

of overall weak performance of the sector, limited access to quality livestock services and markets, limited 

participation of the private sector and institutional and policy gaps and challenges existing in the sector.

18. Key guiding principles underpinning preparation of the proposed project include: 

a. The needs are long term and require policy and institutional reforms, coupled with public and 
private sector investments. The requested IDA support would therefore need to be positioned in a 

broader, longer term support to the sector. The proposed project, likely to have a six year timeframe, 

would aim to invest in addressing some immediate needs in the sector, while supporting key 

institutional building blocks for the longer term development of the sector. 

b. The team would aim to bring in leading global technical knowledge to the preparation process, 
including a close collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 

(FAO), the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) and the World Organization for Animal 

Health (OIE). In this regard, it has been agreed with FAO that its staff would join the preparation 

team and provide substantive inputs for the project design process. 

c. The preparation process would seek to collaborate with IFC, IFAD and on-going WB-financed 
projects to ensure alignment and where appropriate to seek opportunities for more formal 

collaboration and/or co-financing. 

The project would engage with multiple stakeholders in the sector. From the Government side, this would 

stretch beyond the MoLF, and include further relevant Ministries and Agencies, including the Ministry of 

Natural Resource Management (MoNRM), Ministry of Trade, Ministry of Industry, the Agricultural 

Transformation Agency (ATA), etc., at both Federal and Regional levels. It would also include private sector 

participants and associations, and farmer/herder/professional representatives. 
 
Relationship to CPF 
 

19. The Ethiopia Country Partnership Strategy dated August 29, 2012 was completed at the end of FY16 
and the new Country Partnership Framework (CPF) is under preparation. It will be based on the Systematic 

Country Diagnostic (SCD), which was completed in March 2016. The SCD identifies the most critical 

constraints and opportunities facing Ethiopia to accelerate progress towards the WBG twin goals. It emphasizes 

the leading role that agricultural growth (including livestock) has had in driving the reduction of poverty. The 

predominance of agriculture as a source of income for the poorer households in Ethiopia suggests that growth in 

the sector will remain important for poverty reduction in the coming years. The SCD identifies eight binding 

constraints to the achievement of the twin goals, including poor market access for farmers and an uncompetitive 

private sector. These resonate with the aims of the LMP, which emphasizes the need for private sector 

investment with approaches that link livestock producers better to markets. Although still in draft, the new CPF 

will likely include objectives to develop the institutions, services and infrastructure to increase private sector 

engagement in the economy, and to increase agricultural and livestock productivity and commercialization. The 

project would be closely aligned to these goals, as it would aim to increase smallholder productivity and for 

selected products to improve the linkages for smallholders to value chains, and would support the improved 

functioning of these value chains.

C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  
 

 
 
Increase livestock and fisheries productivity , commercialization and market access of targeted smallholders in 
Ethiopia. 

 

20. Strategic approach. The principal aim of the project is to support the government’s strategy for livestock 
growth and transformation as articulated in its GTP2 and LMP in adding value to the existing investments in 

support to the sector. It also supports the fisheries sector, not included on the LMP but newly added by the 

government as a clear priority. The proposed project would follow a dual approach of: (i) supporting immediate 

and long-term capacity building of the newly established MoLF and its strategic national programs; and (ii) 

targeting strategic commodity value chains through a comprehensive support to smallholder producers, in line 

with the government cluster approach.   

 
21. Direct beneficiaries. The primary beneficiaries of the project would include smallholder farmers 
inclusive of family, traditional and small-scale producers; smallholder farmers with improved husbandry 

practices; and producer organizations. Smallholder producers are being considered around four different levels 

of advancement (para. 23). Other direct beneficiaries would be: (i) livestock farmer’s organizations and their 

apex institutions; (ii) small and medium scale private livestock operators and enterprises; (iii) vulnerable groups, 

particularly women and youths; and (iv) livestock support services institutions, including public livestock 

research and extension services, NGOs, and service providers involved in the targeted livestock value chains in 

the project areas.  

22. Indirect beneficiaries. Secondary beneficiaries would include other livestock producers not directly 
involved with the project activities who would indirectly benefit from the national programs (e.g. improved 

animal diseases service delivery). Value chain actors (buyers, processors, and exporters) would benefit from 

increased provision of livestock products. On the consumption side, consumers in Ethiopia would benefit from 

increased and better quality of national animal sourced products supply. Other indirect beneficiaries would be 

livestock service providers, including private veterinarians, and inputs providers, including feed, veterinary 

medicines, and genetic material suppliers. 

23. Transformation pathway. In order to address the actors in holistic and systematic manner, the 
identification mission developed a transformation pathway for improved livestock productivity and 

commercialization. In this pathway, the project envisions the smallholder farmers to move through stages (Stage 

1: Smallholder farmer, Stage 2: stage 1 with improved husbandry practices, Stage 3: stage 2 organized into 

producer organizations and Stage 4: stage 3 in productive partnerships along the value chain) for them to 

achieve the goals of increased productivity, commercialization, and market access, in an inclusive and 

sustainable manner. Each stage requires a specific set of interventions tailored to the beneficiary present status 

in the transformation pathway. Therefore, the project would simultaneously intervene in all four stages of the 

transformation pathway, but with a differentiated focus: stage 1 and stage 2, where most of the Ethiopian 

smallholders are present, would require fundamental access to quality services, inputs and organization and 

management skills; stage 3 and stage 4, where fewer actors are currently present, would require more 

specialized support. Figure 1 below elaborates about the transformation pathway in more detail.

24. Target Value Chains. The project would target three priority value chains considered strategic both for 
food security/national supply and for their potential for growth and innovation. The primary target value chains 

are: (i) dairy with small-scale mixed crop-livestock systems in wet highlands and dairy belts, including peri-

urban areas; (ii) poultry with small-scale broilers and layers systems in all highlands, urban and peri-urban 

production zones; and (iii) fish with improved inland fisheries and aquaculture in selected suitable areas. In 

addition, the project would support the red meat value chain nation-wide through its support to the strategic 

national programs on animal health, access to feed and traceability system, as well as through its direct support 

to the dairy value chain in small-scale mixed crop-livestock systems through specific income generating 

activities such as fattening. The latter would be supported through the capacity building of national programs.  

There is a strong rationale for the selection of the dairy, poultry, and fisheries and aquaculture value chains for 

the project. These commodities are important for the food and nutritional security of the country. Milk is a 

remunerative commodity which can have a significant impact on poverty alleviation efforts for the estimated 8 

million households in Mixed Rainfall Sufficient (MRS) and Mixed Rainfall Deficient (MRD) regions that have 

dairy cattle as primary livestock. In addition, improving the productivity of the dairy sector would have positive 

effect in reducing GHG emission intensity and climatic sustainability. Poultry meat and eggs are important 

sources of protein. Successful poultry interventions would enable the sub-sector to move to improved and more 

organized family poultry with semi-scavenging crossbreds, better access to services, inputs and markets, and 

expand its scale of more specialized dual purposes breeds, and layer and broiler operations. Such a 

transformation would contribute considerably to reducing poverty and increase national income. In addition, 

improving the productivity of the poultry sector would have positive effect on the feed conversion ratio (kg feed 

per kg product), and help meet the Climate Resilience Growth Economy target of increasing the share of 

chicken meat to total meat consumption from the current 5% to 27% by 2030, by substituting red meat with the 

chicken meat. This substitution can have environmental benefits as red meat comes from larger high-emitting 

ruminant. Fisheries and aquaculture are important to address the food and nutrition security. Fish is a 

remunerative commodity and can play a significant role in poverty alleviation efforts for the 100,000 

households who largely depend on fishing, with the potential to increase the number of households to half a

million. Sustainable investment in fisheries would enable Ethiopia to exploit the ample potential of its 

renewable fisheries resources found in many lakes, reservoirs and rivers. Investors are eager to enter the 

aquaculture sub-sector. But some major hurdles including high quality fingerling and fish-feed production, need 

to be removed for such investment to actualize. 

 

25. Geographical targeting: The primary geographic focus area of the project would be the rural and peri-
urban areas of the highland regions where the dairy, poultry, fisheries and aquaculture value chains dominate. 

Furthermore, the project would follow the Government cluster approach and intervene in the existing or planned 

clusters of dairy, poultry and fisheries and aquaculture. This would enable the project to benefit from synergistic 

gains which might arise from other investment (infrastructure, private sector, etc.) coming in these clusters. 

Tentatively, the project might be implemented in the following regions/places in Ethiopia: Amhara, Addis 

Ababa, Oromiya, SNNR, Tigray, Harari, Benishangul Gumuz, Dire Dawa and Gambella. 

 
Key Results (From PCN) 

 
26. The following PDO level results indicators have been identified : 

(i) Number of direct project beneficiaries reached, disaggregated by gender (core indicator) and age 
group (18-35 yrs., representing the youth); 

(ii) Percentage increase of productivity of targeted small-scale productions (by selected commodity);  

(iii) Percentage increase in the sales of targeted small scale production (by selected commodity); and 

(iv) Beneficiary satisfaction rate with livestock services delivery systems supported by the project 
(disaggregated by gender and age group). 

 
D. Concept Description 

 

27. The project would be structured as an Investment Project Financing (IPF), funded by an IDA credit for 
US$150 million over six years (to be confirmed). At this stage, it was agreed with the Government to consider 

structuring the project around the following four components: (A) Strengthening National Programs; (B) 

Farmer’s Access to Productive Services, Inputs and Assets; (C) Farmer’s Access to Output Markets; and 

(D) Project management, coordination and monitoring and evaluation. This structure would be further reviewed 

and revised if necessary during the preparation period.    

28. The first component is crosscutting and designed to build immediate and long term human and 
institutional capacity of the key actors in the livestock and fisheries sector, as well as support key Strategic 

National Programs (SNPs), notably on animal health, feed and genetic [in order to improve the delivery of 

livestock services to small scale livestock producers]. The second component is designed to support sustainable 

productivity increase in the selected commodity value chains, through improved smallholders’ access to 

effective livestock and fisheries services, inputs and productive assets. The third component is designed to 

allow better access to markets for smallholders, through collective actions and productive partnerships, by 

supporting business linkages between livestock producer organizations and/or cooperatives, buyers and 

financial institutions and value addition at producer organizations/cooperatives levels where business

opportunities exist. The fourth component would support implementation of the first three components and 

inform the project execution and performance monitoring, reporting and knowledge management. 

 

Component A: Strengthening National Programs.  The first component of the project would be designed to 

building immediate and long-term human and institutional capacity of the livestock and fisheries sector key 

actors, as well as supporting key selected strategic national programs (SNPs). In addition, this component 

could support the development of a contingency emergency response plan, to increase preparedness in the 

event of a crisis affecting the livestock sector (subcomponent A4). 

 

This component would have the following four sub-components:  

 

29. Sub-component A1. Policy development, investment planning and sector coordination. This sub-
component would strengthen staff capacity in the MoLF to carry out its core responsibilities of sector analysis, 

policy preparation and implementation, and sector monitoring and evaluation, and coordination. Activities 

could include: identification of short-and long-term training and education needs, improvement of the MoLF 

information system, development of a communication strategy and implementation plan to improve the relation 

between the ministry and key stakeholders involved in the targeted value chains, including private investors and 

financial institutions, supporting ongoing modernization and implementation of the sector legislation including 

the development of norms, quality and safety standards of inputs and animal sourced products.  

 

30. Sub-component A2. Sustainable animal health and advisory services. Strengthening Veterinary 
Services (VS) would enhance the government long-term capacity to detect and respond quickly to major disease 

outbreaks (PPR, CBPP, FMD, HPAI and NCD to name a few). It would further contribute to the control of 

‘diseases of production’ (parasitic, vector-born or bacteriological diseases) that negatively affect animal 

productivity. This component would build on the recent results from the OIE Performance of Veterinary 

Services pathway. In conjunction with the SNP2, it aims to promote partnership between the public authorities, 

the private veterinarians, and the associative actors, especially through: (1) re-focusing the official VS towards 

its core public functions, (2) scaling up of the sanitary mandate approach (delegating, under the oversight of the 

official VS, public tasks to private veterinarians), (3) progressive transfer of private tasks to the private and 

associative actors, and (4) supporting the veterinary statutory body (auto-control of the veterinary profession).  

 

31.  Strengthening Extension Services (ES), especially animal husbandry management practices, would 
require a transition from a public system of technical subjects delivery to a public-private system of 

comprehensive and adapted (basic or specialized) advisory services. In conjunction with the SNPs, the specific 

path for such a transformation would be defined during project preparation.  

 

32. Strengthening Producer Cooperatives (PCs), would be the necessary complement to the VS and ES, to 
improve the capacity of the smallholders in formulating their needs and evaluate the services they receive. 

Ultimately, the growth and transformation of the livestock and fisheries sector would require a strong and well-

balanced institutional tripartite: the Public, Private, and Cooperative sectors working together to deliver the 

fundamental functions of the sector. Support to the VS, ES and PCs would have a national coverage, although 

specific activities would be targeted towards the selected commodity value chains, in conjunction with 

subcomponent B2.

33. Sub-component A3. Strategic national programs (SNP). Five major national programs were 
considered during identification. They would be further developed during project preparation.  

a. Animal identification, traceability and performance recording (SNP1) 
b. Animal health program

 (SNP2) 

c. National forage development (SNP3) 
d. Dairy-meat and poultry breeding program (SNP4) 
e. Sustainable fisheries management and biodiversity conservation (SNP5)  

 

The World Bank Group is supporting b) Animal health and d) Dairy/poultry breeding policy in the L-MIRE 

project. The proposed project will build on this work.   

 

34. Sub-component A4. Contingency emergency response (US$0 million). Following an adverse natural 
event that results in a major natural disaster, the government of Ethiopia may request the Bank to reallocate 

project funds to support response and reconstruction. This component would draw resources from the 

unallocated expenditure category and /or allow the government to request the Bank to re-categorize and 

reallocate financing from other Project components to partially cover emergency response and costs. This 

component could also channel additional funds should they become available as a result of an eligible 

emergency. Detailed operational guidelines acceptable to the bank for their implementation of the Contingency 

Emergency Response Plan, would be prepared during the first year of project implementation. Should this 

component be triggered, all expenditures would be made in accordance with paragraph 11 of OP 10.00 and 

would be reviewed and accepted by the Bank before any disbursement is made. In accordance with paragraphs 

11 and 12 of OP 10.00, this component would provide immediate, rapidly disbursing support to finance goods 

(positive list agreed with governments), works, and services needed for response, mitigation, and recovery and 

reconstruction.  

 

Component B: Farmer’s Access to Services, Inputs and Assets. The project would support smallholders’ 

access to critical knowledge and information, services and inputs, and investments (technologies and 

equipment) focusing on the three targeted commodity value chains of (1) dairy (dairy-meat in mixed crop-

livestock systems), (2) poultry (broilers and layers) and (3) fisheries (cultured-based fisheries and aquaculture). 

The project would link and work with Federal and Regional Agriculture Research Institutes to facilitate access 

to new technologies, innovations and management practices. 

 

This component would have the following three sub-components: 

 

35. Sub-component B1. Access to knowledge and information. This component would support capacity-
building activities of smallholders and their organizations on good management practices tailored to each 

selected commodity value chain, as well as on organizational skills towards the establishment of future and 

strengthening of existing producer organizations. It would design and pilot an information system accessible by 

smallholders and their organizations for the selected commodity value chain, in conjunction with SNP1.  

 

36. Sub-component B2. Access to services and inputs. This component aims to improve smallholders’ 

                                            
14

 During identification, the following five building blocks were discussed: (i) Creating a conducive and coherent policy environment; (ii) Strengthening diseases 

surveillance capacity; (iii) Strengthening diagnostic capacities and laboratories; (iv) Supporting diseases prevention and control programs; and (v) Including one health 

and food safety considerations.

access to advisory services, animal health services, Animal Genetic Resources (AnGR) and quality forage and 

feed. While it complements sub-component A2, it focuses on each selected commodity value chain and would 

support the establishment of a public-private collaboration to develop a comprehensive (inclusive of all 

services) and differentiated (tailored to the level of advancement of the smallholder or his/her organization) 

system of service, input and advice delivery.     

     

37. Sub-component B3. Access to productive investments. This component aims to improve the 
smallholders’ access to investments linking smallholders and/or their organizations to public and private 

providers of basic equipment and new technologies, and to financial institutions. Production-oriented 

investments could include: feed production and processing, improved animal husbandry techniques, small-scale 

products’ collection or processing units/equipment, waste management systems to minimize greenhouse gas 

emissions, pollution and dissemination of pathogens, renewable energy (bio and solar energy) supply. To 

minimize a farmer’s risk of accessing improved technologies, the component would establish a matching grant 

mechanism to co-finance strategic investments, i.e. investment linked with the adoption of new technologies 

and practices associated with the SNP or investments aimed at increasing the participation of women and youth 

in the selected value chains.   

 

Component C: Farmers’ Access to Output Markets.  The project would support smallholders and their 

organizations to improve their access to output markets with a broader engagement of local entrepreneurs in the 

three priority commodity value chains. Depending on the beneficiary level of advancement in the 

transformation pathway, several options for project support would be explored further during preparation. 

Lessons from recent experiences in similar conditions would be considered. These include the existing USAID-

parallel financed AMDe and Livestock Market Development projects, which support improved market linkages, 

and regional initiatives such as the Hub Approach in Milk Collection Centers. The component would establish 

“Productive Partnerships” (PPs) between livestock and fisheries Producer Cooperatives (PC) and buyers (Agri-

Businesses: agro-industries, small and medium enterprises, etc.). These PPs would be supported through the 

provision of matching grants, contingent upon contractual arrangement between producers and buyers, and 

would facilitate access to rural financing for investing in various PC Sub-Projects (SPs). The selection criteria 

and mechanisms for PPs and SPs would be detailed during project preparation. The overall aim of this 

component is to create an enabling environment for direct and sustainable commercial relations between 

producers and buyers of products in the targeted value chains, and with Financial Institutions (FIs). 

 

This component would have the following three sub-components: 

 

38. Sub-component C1. Support to Producer Cooperatives (PCs). The sub-component would support the 
establishment of sustainable business relations between targeted PCs and Financial Institutions (FIs). To 

facilitate the involvement of FIs and the provision of adapted financial services, the subcomponent would 

support capacity building of PCs in the area of preparation of viable Sub-Projects (SPs). Capacity-building 

activities related to PCs’ business and administrative skills could be conducted in partnership with IFC through 

its Business Edge 
TM

 training system. Additional 

activities in support to PCs could include: (i) supporting market studies and surveys to characterize market 

opportunities and product requirements, organizing communication and dissemination campaigns to inform 

stakeholders about the project, and creating an online-based market information system; (ii) the establishment 

of a dialog platform between the government and key stakeholders, and (iii) mobilizing financial institutions 

(FIs) by negotiating a co-financing agreement for the SPs, and providing technical assistance on the design of

tailored financial services and products to meet the financing needs of eligible SPs.  

 

39. Sub-component C2. Establishment of Productive Partnerships (PPs). This sub-component would 
promote partnerships between PCs and buyers of selected commodities (milk, poultry meat and eggs, fish). 

Financial Institutions (FIs) would be included in the PPs as they are expected to co-finance the sub-projects to 

be developed by the PCs. The partnerships would be based on the following principles: (a) agreement on 

product quality and characteristics; (b) quantity to be produced and bought; (c) modalities of delivery; (d) 

payment modalities and price; and (e) buyer’s contribution, such as Technical Assistance (TA), specific inputs, 

and arrangements for input reimbursement. 

 

40. Sub-component C3. Access to Financial Institutions (FIs). This sub-component would finance SPs, 
which have been developed by PCs under the Productive Partnerships established under sub-component C2. 

Based on a PC’s business plan, investment would cover collective investments through a Matching Grant aimed 

at improving the market reliability (commercial and safety standards) of the selected commodities. Collective 

investments would include post-productive investments (including processing technologies and facilities), as 

well as the associated technical assistance and training. A conditionality mechanism would be built into the 

Matching Grant to ensure that the Sub-Projects promote health and environmental services or at least do not 

generate negative externalities, and would be screened for potential adverse effects on the environment and 

public health. Selected SPs could be financed through a combination of an IDA-financing, a contribution from 

PCs, and short to medium-term credit provided by participating FIs. 

 

Component D: Project Management, Coordination, and Monitoring and Evaluation. The component 

would support project management at federal, regional, zonal and woreda level. In addition to routine 

functions, emphasis would be placed on a number of critical cross-cutting issues: 

 

41. Gender. The project would support the Government’s policy to mainstream the participation of women 
(both female headed households and women in male headed households) and youth into the livestock and 

fisheries sectors. This would include both targeted interventions (including support to women groups for 

appropriate enterprises) and ensuring inclusion in all project activities, backed up with an M&E system with 

disaggregated data.  

 

42. Nutrition. Although improved nutrition is not an explicit or measurable outcome of the proposed 
project, there would be many activities that would support aspects of the National Nutrition Program. For 

example, the support to the three selected commodity value chains would be coupled with extension/advisory 

services to increase households understanding of the high nutritional value and best uses of animal sourced 

foods (milk, meat, eggs and fish).  

 

43. Greenhouse gas emissions / Climate smart livestock (CSL). Livestock production critically 
contributes to the 3 outcomes of CSL: (i) it contributes directly and indirectly to food production and food 

security, (ii) it offers adaptation strategies, through assets diversification, coping mechanisms and water 

management, and (iii) it offers great potential for GHG emission intensity reduction and carbon sequestration. 

In terms of livestock production systems, Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) translates into four essential 

objectives: resource use efficiency, reduced conversion of natural habitats into agriculture, buffering and

connection to markets. Most technical and institutional interventions would have effects on more than one of 

the CSA outcomes. 

44. Capacity building. The design of the proposed project would include capacity building for a range of 
actors and organizations and through a number of approaches, including training. In a recent project (e.g. AGP 

1), the effectiveness of training was found to be relatively weak. A more focused and structured approach to 

capacity building would be developed for the project, drawing upon both good experience in Ethiopia (such as 

under the Productive Safety Nets Program or the Farmer’s Filed School in the Integrated Pest Management and 

forage development Programs) and international experience. This would emphasize strengthening core skills for 

delivering training and stronger processes for training needs assessment, continual training where appropriate 

and adequate follow up.  

 

45. Linkages and Coordination. The project would be one of the primary government program to support 
investments to achieve the strategic goals set out by the LMP. However, it would not function in isolation and 

coordination and complementarity with other initiatives would provide opportunities for increased impact. This 

is particularly important because Ethiopia is hosting a number of active projects in the sector –implemented by 

various ministries- that the new MoLF would have to monitor. Coordination mechanisms would need to be 

strengthened with a number of other on-going and planned programs, including the following IDA-financed 

projects and programs: Agriculture Growth Project 2, Productive Safety Net Program, Sustainable Land 

Management Program, and Regional Pastoral Livelihoods Resilience Project (RPLRP) and the WBG’s Ethiopia 

Livestock-MIRA project. 
 

 
 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
Tentatively, the project might be implemented in the following regions/places in Ethiopia: Amhara, Addis Ababa, 

Oromiya, SNNR, Tigray, Harari, Benishangul Gumuz, Dire Dawa and Gambella 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The MoLF is a new ministry with a significant capacity weakness. Therefore, efforts would be required throughout the 

project, in particular in the areas of safeguards due diligence. Given the institutional and management innovations that is 
expected from the project, three distinct value chains are targeted, including the newly supported fisheries sector, and 
the multiplicity of actors involved from the public, private and associative sectors, capacity constraints are likely to 
represent the biggest challenge of the project. To address these gaps, it has been proposed to formulate a capacity 
building strategy for the MoLF during the preparation phase. The Bank would undertake a safeguards capacity 
assessment as part of the project preparation, which would outline the detailed risks and mitigating measures. The 
project would further explore to provide systematic and regular training to targeted the Regions and Woredas as well as 
undertake regular supervision to ensure that challenges with regards to environmental and social safeguards are 
identified and addressed in a timely manner. Overall, the project will avoid where possible adverse impacts on people, 
land and other economic resources and on livelihoods; will prepare both a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and

Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) to address potential scope of impacts, since the project sites 
are not known. The ESMF and RPF will be reviewed and cleared by the World Bank before it is disclosed publicly in 
Ethiopia and the Bank’s Info shop prior to project appraisal. Site specific Resettlement Action Plan and ESMPs, will be 
prepared, reviewed and cleared by the World Bank, as needed based on the guidance and standards set forth in the RPF, 
prior to implementation of any compensation actions or civil works.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The project is proposed as a Category B project, given 
that it would finance activities, especially those related 
to veterinary services to detect and respond quickly to 
major disease outbreaks, improved animal health 
services, production of quality forage and feed, 
including feed production and processing, small scale- 
products’ collection/ processing units, waste 
management systems to minimize greenhouse gas 
emissions, pollution and dissemination of pathogens. 
Since the scope and nature of the sub-projects and 
their site-specific locations are not known at this time 
of preparation, the specific instrument proposed for 
analyzing potential environmental risks is an ESMF. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 TBD 
 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 TBD 
 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

Project funds may be used to purchase and distribute 
pesticides for control of vectors of livestock /animal 
diseases and agrochemicals for improved production 
of forage and feed, and it is likely that more generally 
support through the Project will encourage small 
holder farmers, and veterinary service providers to use 
more pesticides and chemicals. The ESMF will contain 
a section on PMP/IPMP that would elaborate on what 
actions need to be undertaken to minimize 
environmental, health and safety impacts. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 No 
 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

The Project triggers OP 4.10 as the vast majority of 
people in the lowland area of the project area meet 
the criteria for the Indigenous People or underserved 
groups.  The project will conduct Social Assessment 
and enhanced public Consultation with the affected

persons and communities to reflect the policy 
requirements. The key findings of the social 
assessment including the process used to foster free, 
prior, and informed consultations and broad 
community support for the project, including the 
provision of grievance redress, and benefit sharing 
issues; and the identified mitigating measures will be 
incorporated in the design of the project and 
summarized in the PAD. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

Since the project sites are not known, therefore, to 
address potential scope of impacts on loss of 
economic activities, land acquisition and/or relocation, 
the project will avoid adverse impacts on people, land 
and other economic resources and on livelihoods by 
preparing a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). The 
RPF will be consulted upon and reviewed and cleared 
by the World Bank before it is disclosed publicly in 
Ethiopia and the Bank’s Info shop prior to project 
appraisal. In cases where impacts are known, the 
project will Resettlement Action Plan, based on the 
guidance and standards set forth in the RPF, and the 
RAP will also be reviewed and cleared by the World 
Bank prior to implementation of any compensation 
actions or civil works. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 
 

Projects on International Waterways

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Regional and Country Context           
                            Figure 1: The Lake Chad 

1. Lake Chad is a large transboundary lake located in the Sahel as well 
as in the West and the Central Africa sub-regions. The Lake Chad is shared 

between Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria1 and a total of 49 million people 

live from the exploitation of its rich natural resources (fishing, livestock 

farming, flood-recession agriculture, hunting and gathering). A net exporter of 

food and a provider of seasonal jobs, it also contributed to the food and job 

security of people in its hinterlands2, including two regional metropolises, 

Ndjamena and Maidiguri, as well as the impoverished regions of the lake’s 

Sahelian hinterlands (Borno in Nigeria; Diffa in Niger, the Far North Province 

in Cameroon and the regions of the Lake, Lac, Kanem, Hadjer Lamis, and Chari 

Baguirmi in Chad). If the lake area represents such a food production hub, it is 

because it offers, all year long, a relative secure source of water, fodder and 

fertile land. Moreover, those mostly family fishing and farming systems are labor intensive and generate 

significant indirect employment (processing, trade, crafts, and transport). Finally, the ecological value of Lake 

Chad has been recognized by the Ramsar convention and the Lake is being classified a World Natural Heritage 

Site by UNESCO. 

2. Despite its potential of being a driver for development in West Africa, however, development in the 
Lake Chad area is challenged by multiple and interrelated drivers of conflict and fragility. Most recently, 

the Boko Haram regional insurgency has affected over 23 million civilians around the four countries (Cameroon, 

Chad, Niger and Nigeria). Violent acts caused by Boko Haram include coercion, abduction, forced recruitment, 

                                            
1 This project includes the three countries Cameroon, Chad and Niger. While the World Bank’s broader Lake Chad Program includes Nigeria, Nigeria 

is not participating in this concrete project. This project, however, is processed as a Series of Projects, and will thus allow for the participation of 

Nigeria to opt into the program at a later date and according to the country’s needs and specific requirements. 
2 The lake hinterlands, or its area of influence through trade and seasonal migration, extends-up to 300 km around the Lake and represents an area of 

about 250,000 km2.

indoctrination, human rights abrogation, violent extremism, etc. and besides causing immense psychological 

trauma and weakening social networks, these acts have also disrupted livelihoods and destroyed assets. The 

conflict has exacerbated pre-existing challenges and caused extensive damage. As a consequence of the Boko 

Haram conflict, the Lake Chad Region is also Africa’s largest forced displacement crisis. Latest estimates show 

2.3 million individuals (half of them are children) are now displaced in the Region, both internally and across 

borders as refugees.3 These significant numbers of refugees and IDPs have added pressure on host communities 

that are already food insecure. 

 

3. Vulnerable groups, in particular women and youth have been mostly affected by the consequences 
of the Boko Haram crisis. While youth account for most of the population in the countries around the lake and 

could be a potential driver for economic growth, they are faced with the highest rates of unemployment and the 

lowest levels of formal education and vocational training in the respective countries. Facing limited opportunity, 

youth are easily susceptible to recruitment into criminal activity or armed violence. Young women and men who 

have been recruited and used by armed groups are especially vulnerable as they are marginalized and stigmatized 

by their communities (when and if they return), thus facing many barriers to their reintegration.4 Gender-based 

violence (GBV) and violence against children, already widespread in the Lake Chad Region before the outbreak 

of the Boko Haram conflict has also increased since the crisis (reported acts include abduction, detention, rape or 

forced marriages, and the forced use of children as kamikazes). In addition, common to many young women in 

the Region is the experience of early marriage and childbirth and resultant health risks. 

 

4. The underlying causes of the Boko Haram crisis include high inequality, perceived social injustice, 

a lack of social service provision, historic marginalization, inadequate economic opportunities, high levels 

of poverty, rapid demographic growth and the impacts of climate change and land degradation. The conflict 

can be traced back to a range of fragility drivers and historical underinvestment in remote areas. Fragility drivers 

include i) lack of public services; ii) the pressure on the already fragile ecosystem which is significantly increasing 

due to a high population growth5, iii) poor natural resource management, and climate and disaster risks in the 

Region6; iv) weak governance and weak presence of state institutions; v) weak agriculture performance vi) poor 

connectivity around the lake and rural access roads which are old and not regularly maintained, and vii) missing 

international road corridor and energy transmission linkages. The lack of public services, basic infrastructure and 

social services within the areas surrounding the Lake Chad reflect systemic national development problems and 

are a result of many years of neglect by central authorities. Grievances of the populations living in the Lake Chad 

Region are further deepened by repeated unfulfilled promises of development and many have lost their trust in 

the government. As one of the results, the areas surrounding the Lake Chad represent the poorest, most 

                                            
3 Plan International, Lake Chad Snapshot, 15 Feb 2018. 
4 Young women have especially been negatively impacted as they have been facing the additional stigma of being survivors of sexual violence. 
5 The population of the four countries around the Lake Chad (Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria; entire territory of the countries, not vicinities of the 

Lake Chad) has more than quadrupled in the last 50 years – from 60 million in 1960 to more than 243 million inhabitants in 2017. See UNFPA: From 

crisis to development around Lake Chad, Strategy for an Integrated, Holistic and Sustainable Response, 2018. 
6 The project has been screened for climate and disaster risks. The exposure of the project locations and the impacts on the project’s physical 

infrastructure and assets have been rated as High. Extreme temperature, extreme precipitation, flooding and drought are projected to increase in all 

three participating countries of this regional project (Cameroon, Chad and Niger) and in particular in the Lake Chad Region. Future projections show 

that mean annual temperature is projected to increase between 1.0-3.4°C by 2060. Annual number of ‘warm’ days and nights are also projected to 

increase. Projected increase in inter-annual rainfall variability is likely to exacerbate drought risk in the future. Projected increases in seasonal rainfall, 

total runoff, and the proportion of rainfall in heavy events will have profound implications for flooding. These extreme climate and hazard events affect 

marginalized groups more severely.

marginalized and neglected part of each respective country and have been left susceptible to crime and violence 

and promises from radical Islamists. In Cameroon, for example, poverty is increasingly concentrated in the 

northern parts of the country – the Far North and the North present a poverty rate of 74.3% and 67.9% respectively, 

and the literacy rate is almost half in the North (43%) compared to the rest of the country (72% nationally). While 

the regions bordering the Lake Chad in Chad and Niger have been less marginalized and less excluded from 

development planning compared to equivalent regions in Cameroon and Nigeria, development indicators remain 

worse than the national averages.7 

 

5. As a result, a military victory and humanitarian assistance alone are not enough to create peace and 

stability in the Lake Chad Region and a focus on restoring and enhancing resilience is needed, even as 

humanitarian activities and security operations continue. As outlined in the joint World Bank Group’s (WBG) 

and United Nations “Pathways for Peace Study” (2018), conflict stems from the mobilization of people’s 

perception of exclusion and injustice, which are rooted in inequalities, and tackling these issues should be a 

priority to prevent further escalation of conflict. While military and security agencies have made some progress 

in limiting the activities of extremist groups, their own practices have, at times, been heavy-handed and have 

included violations of human rights, adding to the sense of insecurity and alienation which increase divisions 

among displaced persons and communities. Furthermore, social inclusion will also be key for a long-term 

stabilization and prevention of future conflicts. In this regard, preventive action needs to adopt a more people-

centered approach that includes mainstreaming citizen engagement. Enhancing the participation of women and 

youth in decision making, as well as long-term policies to address the aspirations of women and young people, 

will also be fundamental to sustaining peace. 

 

6. The conflict has significantly impacted livelihoods and economic productivity in the Lake Chad 

Region, which are largely based on farming, pastoralism and fishing. The main impacts of the conflict include 

inaccessibility and a loss of productive assets and inputs due to human displacement and the disruption of markets 

due to physical destruction of facilities, and the enforcement of security-related measures such as restrictions of 

movement and the prohibition to farm or trade in certain areas.8 As a result, agricultural production and access to 

land have declined sharply, resulting in a widespread loss of livelihoods and employment. In addition to direct 

losses in productive assets, agricultural trade has also been significantly impaired by damages to the road network 

and the closure of borders. The recent AFD/IRD study “Crisis and Development – the Lake Chad Region and 

Boko Haram” shows that the Lake Chad Region was a highly complex and interlinked regional system prior to 

2013, where the country’s borders did not represent real boundaries. Acts of violence by Boko Haram have 

destabilized the former regional system and have compromised productive activities in the rural areas around the 

Lake Chad. A growth of rural income and livelihood opportunities combined with connectivity improvements 

would build the resilience of the population around the Lake Chad and thus help to (i) give the population, and in 

particular those who are at-risk a viable livelihood option besides joining Boko Haram, (ii) restore the 

communities’ trust in the government and the prospect for development in the region, and (iii) reestablish 

community ties.

7. A regional and geospatial targeted approach will help to chart a path that promotes growth and 
economic clustering, while at the same time efficiently promoting inclusion, equal opportunities, and 

security. The contextual rationale for a regional response is three-fold9: (i) The Boko Haram insurgency is a 

regional crisis with significant cross-border spill-over effects; (ii) the Region is characterized by a web of 

economic, trade, historical, political, cultural, ethnic and religious ties, which makes its populations linked and 

interdependent across borders. Events in one country affect others, and the problems of weak community 

institutions, livelihoods and connectivity can only be solved through a broader regional response; and (iii) the 

Lake Chad area is a fragile and vulnerable socio-ecosystem and regional in nature. Furthermore, the “Lagging 

Lands, Violent Lands”10 framework for action suggests a combined spatial and social lens for such areas and 

around country borders where interventions as well as violence can have impacts that spill beyond national 

boundaries. In the Lake Chad Region, where violence is recurrent, and divisions are entrenched, area-based 

interventions that are spatially targeted at places with development deficiencies and socially targeted at factors 

that elevate the risk of violence are required in order to create areas which can become socially, politically and 

economically stable. Coordination between administrative areas at national and regional levels will also be key 

to ensure regional stability and exploit possible positive economic and social externalities, such as those achieved 

by public productive investments, livelihoods, value chain development and transport infrastructure investments. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

 
8. The current security crisis has forced countries of the region to coordinate and collaborate more 
extensively on security issues, though on development there is a general lack of regional leadership and 

collaboration on common problems. These issues surfaced during the Oslo Consultative Group meeting in 

Berlin (September 2017). The lack of collaboration between regional economic communities of the Economic 

Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Economic Community of Central African States 

(ECCAS-CEEAC), and the weakness of the Lake Chad Basin Commission, means that a coherent regional 

response to the deeply-rooted drivers of fragility will remain challenging. While putting in place a sustainable 

platform for programmatic prioritization and coordination, regional dialogue, exchange of ideas and policy 

harmonization will take time and will require sustained support over many years, it will be an important and 

necessary early step for the long-term sustainable development of the Region and will help to restore citizens’ 

trust in government interventions. 

 

9. The Sahel Alliance has opened a window of opportunity for stabilization and recovery in the Lake 
Chad Region. Informed and sustained high-level dialogue and diplomacy in coordination with strong 

international commitment are the prerequisites to help build trust between neighboring governments in areas 

beyond security cooperation. During the International High-Level Conference on the Sahel in Brussels, Belgium 

on February 23, 2018, France, Germany, the EU, the African Development Bank, UNDP and the World Bank 

(the six founding members), joined by Italy, Spain and the UK, officially launched the Sahel Alliance, which 

paved the way for international cooperation following the guiding principles of (a) governance; (b) gender; (c) 

youth and (d) donor coordination. The AFD, EU/DEVCO, AfDB, Germany, the UK and USAID, amongst others, 

have already made allocations for stabilization and development activities in the Lake Chad Basin in parallel to 

humanitarian funding. This proposed Lake Chad Region Recovery and Development Project (i) builds upon the 

                                            
9 The IEG found that a regional approach is relevant if i) program objectives require cooperation among neighboring countries to address regional 

externalities, ii) program objectives align with country and regional development priorities, and iii) the program adheres to the principle of subsidiarity. 

These three conditions are fulfilled in the case of this proposed engagement.

momentum created by the launching of the Sahel Alliance, and (ii) constitutes the World Bank’s commitment to 

the Sahel Alliance by focusing on the stabilization of a main sub-region – the Lake Chad Region. The project 

aligns with the specific objectives of the Sahel Alliance by ensuring a strong coordination with the members of 

the Sahel Alliance, promoting multilateralism and better coordination and collaboration with humanitarian and 

development partners and security actors, in particular through the proposed Component 1, and by putting special 

emphasis on the development of rural areas and infrastructure development through the proposed Component 2 

and 3. 

 

10. The project contributes and will be guided by the World Bank’s Regional Recovery and 
Development Strategy for the Lake Chad Region (Lake Chad Region Business Plan) which is currently 

being developed. A first mapping of WBG responses in the Lake Chad Region has showed that the total amount 

of current World Bank activities in the Region is an estimated USD 470 million11 and that more than 10 million 

beneficiaries benefit from these activities. There is thus a considerable scope for the WBG to scale up its 

development support to the Lake Chad Region, though particularly in Chad and Niger. To this end, the World 

Bank is currently developing its longer-term strategy for the Lake Chad Region of which this project is an integral 

part of. In this context, a grant of the State and Peace-building Fund has been approved in September 2018 for 

the Cross-border collaboration in the Lake Chad Region Project to build the foundations of this Regional 

Recovery and Development Strategy for the Lake Chad region by enhancing cross-collaboration between the four 

countries around the Lake (the three countries participating in this proposed project and also Nigeria)12.

11. The project is part of the World Bank’s Lake Chad Region Program. The project constitutes the 
second phase (“Stabilization and early recovery) of the World Bank’s three-phased Lake Chad Region Program 

and prepares the transition from a national post-crisis response (Phase 1) to a long-term resilience and sustainable 

development response (Phase 3) in the Lake Chad Region. The World Bank’s broader Lake Chad Region Program 

                                            
11 USD 140 million have recently been spent on activities and USD 330 million are currently in progress. The national breakdown is the following: 

Nigeria: USD 230 million; Chad: USD 75 million; Cameroon: USD 150 million and Niger: USD 15 million. 
12 The expected outputs of the cross-border collaboration in the Lake Chad Region Project are: (i) Support to the Lake Chad Basin Governors’ Forum 

organization including an early 2019 meeting in Niger; (ii)  Citizen engagement consultation/awareness workshop; (iii) Establishment of a knowledge 

and monitoring platform for the Lake Chad; (iv) Establishment of a data center; (v) Study on multi-dimensional risks around the Lake Chad; and (vi) 

Stakeholder engagement including quarterly multi-partner meetings and support to key conferences (briefs, presentations and participation).

aims to address regional, national and sub-national drivers of fragility through a programmatic, coordinated and 

holistic approach. It is guided by the following five key principles of engagement: (i) a multi-phased and multi-

sector approach to increase the resilience of populations; (ii) flexibility for both riparian client countries and 

stakeholders in their degree of engagement; (iii) flexibility in resource allocation across project components and 

geographic locations; (iv) convergence of efforts with other donors and initiatives along the humanitarian-

development-security nexus; and (v) use of innovative project preparation and M&E mechanisms, such as third-

party execution or monitoring, on an as-needed basis. 

 

12. The World Bank’s Lake Chad Region Program was confirmed at the High-Level Conference on the 
Lake Chad Region in Berlin 2018. On September 3-4, 17 UN Member States, the European Commission, the 

World Bank and the African Development Bank combined announced US$2.17 billion and US$ 467 million in 

concessional loans to support a comprehensive response to the crisis in the Lake Chad Region. The conference 

also highlighted the regional dimension of the Lake Chad crisis, the crucial role of local actors, cross-border 

cooperation and ownership at all levels. Furthermore, stakeholders committed to address the immediate and 

longer-term needs and help build the resilience of crisis-affected people in the Lake Chad region – thus strongly 

endorsing the work along the humanitarian-development-security nexus.13

13. The project is aligned with the WBG’s priorities and UN Strategies in the Lake Chad Region. The 
WBG’s engagement in the Lake Chad Region is aligned with the two interrelated pillars of its Africa Strategy: 

(i) vulnerability and resilience; and (ii) economic opportunity and integration, the Bank’s corporate priority under 

IDA 18, aimed at scaling up its response to issues of fragility, conflict and violence, as well as the Lake Chad 

Development and Climate Resilience Action Plan and the Africa Climate Business Plan. The proposed project 

will be aligned with the International Finance Corporation’s (IFC) Sectorial Strategy and Operations in the three 

countries. Furthermore, the project is aligned and reinforces UNDP’s and UNOCHA’s “Resilience for Sustainable 

Development in the Lake Chad Basin”, UNFPA’s “From Crisis to development around Lake Chad – Strategy for 

                                            
13 Most activities in the region are almost entirely focused on a humanitarian response with very little development programming, in particular on the 
Chadian and Nigerien side. While humanitarian actors have begun incorporating resilience programming and small development interventions, there 

is an identified need for development actors to engage at scale and support the development of the regions adjoining the Lake Chad.

an Integrated, Holistic and Sustainable Response” and the “UN Support Plan for the Sahel – Working together 

for a prosperous and peaceful Sahel”. This will be done by supporting the transition from a medium-term response 

focusing on resilience and recovery to a longer-term response that will strengthen transformation and 

development. The project will adapt a comprehensive people-centered approach and will, as highlighted in various 

UN Strategy Documents, strengthen resilience of communities in the Lake Chad Region that improves coping 

capacity and reduces vulnerabilities. 

 

14. The project is also in strong alignment with existing regional and national strategies and plans. The 
project is in line with the recommendations of Cameroon’s RPBA to focus all efforts on achieving concrete results 

around the following objectives: (i) putting in place durable solutions for forced displacement; (ii) improving 

local development/decentralization processes and the functioning of local governance; (iii) improving the 

provision of basic social services; (iv) promoting the recovery of the economy and improvement of economic 

opportunities; and (v) improving individual and territorial security. Furthermore, the proposed project is aligned 

with the nine pillars of the “Regional Strategy for the Stabilization, Recovery and Resilience of the Boko-Haram 

affected areas of the Lake Chad Basin” which has been adopted by the Lake Chad Basin Ministers on August 31, 

2018. The nine pillars of the strategy are: (i) Political cooperation; (ii) security and human rights; (iii) 

disarmament, demobilization, rehabilitation, reinsertion and reintegration of Persons Associated with Boko 

Haram; (iv) humanitarian assistance; (v) governance and social contract; (vi) socio-economic recovery and 

environmental sustainability; (vii) education and vocational training; (viii) prevention of violent extremism and 

peacebuilding; and (ix) empowerment and inclusion of women and youth, respond to the multilayered challenges 

in the Lake Chad Basin region. 
 

Relationship to CPF and other strategies 
 

15. The project’s objectives are fully aligned with the Country Partnership Frameworks (CPF) for Chad, Cameroon and 
Niger: 

 Chad: The three identified themes of engagement for FY16-20 are: (i) Strengthening management of public 
resources; (ii) improving returns to agriculture and building value chains; and (iii) building human capital and 

reducing vulnerability. The proposed project addresses the second and third themes of the CPF by supporting 

public productive investments and development along the agricultural value chain, enhancing sustainable 

livelihoods of local communities, strengthening social accountability mechanisms, and improving rural transport 

linkages. 

 Cameroon: The three focus areas for FY17-21 are: (i) Addressing multiple poverty traps in rural areas (with a 
focus on northern regions); (ii) fostering infrastructure and private sector development; and (iii) improving 

governance. The proposed project will address the first focus area by supporting public productive investments, 

improving access to livelihoods and rural transport linkages in the Far North Region of Cameroon. 

 Niger: The three focus areas for FY18-21 are: (i) Rural productivity and incomes; (ii) human capital and social 
protection; and (iii) governance for jobs and growth. The proposed project focuses mainly on the first focus area 

of the CPF ‘Rural Productivity and Incomes’ by directly improving rural livelihoods (in particular the agricultural 

value chain), rural connectivity and public productive investments. 

 

16. Relationship to Africa’s Regional Integration and Cooperation Assistance. The project’s objectives are aligned 
with the “Supporting Africa’s Transformation: Regional Integration and Cooperation Assistance Strategy (FY18-FY23)” 

and in particular its strategic priority 4 “promote collective action to address risks of regional economic contagion, fragility, 

epidemic and climate hot spots”. Sub-objective 4.2 refers to support to sustainable management and financing of

transboundary waters and 4.3 to provide support to communities affected by regional forced displacement and help countries 

to deal with underlying conflict prevention measures. 

 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 

17. The proposed project development objective for the Lake Chad Region Recovery and Development 
Project-SOP1 is the following: to contribute to the recovery of the Lake Chad Region through supporting regional 

coordination and crisis monitoring, connectivity and agricultural livelihoods in selected provinces of Cameroon, 

Chad and Niger. 

 

18. The proposed program development objective is the following: to contribute to the recovery of the Lake 
Chad Region through enhanced regional coordination and crisis monitoring, socio-economic development and 

the strengthening of local level institutions in the Lake Chad Region. 

  

19. Project beneficiaries will be vulnerable populations in selected intervention areas in the three countries. 
This includes, for instance, youth at risk and women. While not specifically targeted, project beneficiaries could 

also include displaced and ex-combatants. While the project intends to include activities which also support the 

R (“Reintegration”) of ex-Boko Haram combatants, this project does not specifically target ex-Boko Haram 

combatants so as to avoid any possible stigmatization that would exacerbate an already very difficult social 

cohesion effort between and within communities. 
 
Key Results (From PCN) 
 

20. The following PDO indicators will be considered and refined during project preparation: 
- Establishment of a functioning knowledge and monitoring platform endorsed by the participating 

countries. 

- Increased regional dialogue and coordination on conflict and climate and disaster risk management among 
the three countries (Cameroon, Chad and Niger).14 

- Number of direct project beneficiaries in the three countries (number), of which percent of female and 
youth. 

- Beneficiaries in the three countries that feel project investments reflected their needs (percentage), of 
which percent of female and youth. 

- Beneficiaries in the three countries that feel that project investments have positively contributed to the 
community’s social well-being and have helped to restore trust. 

- Beneficiaries of regional economic development activities that report an increase in income 
(disaggregated by type of service, gender and target group). 

- Improvement of Rural Access Index (RAI; number of index points improvement).

D. Concept Description 
 
                                 Figure 4: The Project’s Intervention Rationale 
21. To restore and enhance resilience in the 
Lake Chad Region, this project will work along the 

humanitarian-development-security nexus to (i) 

address some of the existing drivers of fragility in 

the Lake Chad Region, in particular poor regional 

crisis preparedness and management, poor 

connectivity around and on the Lake, poor local 

governance and unemployment (especially youth 

unemployment), and (ii) mitigate some 

consequences of the crisis, in particular destroyed 

public productive investments, poor livelihood 

opportunities and a weakened agriculture value 

chain. More concretely, this project will bridge the gap between humanitarian and development assistance and 

support its transition. Investments will be made complementary to humanitarian activities and collaboration and 

coordination with security actors will allow the project to operate in an insecure environment and support the 

recovery of provinces where security interventions have achieved to bring peace back to the communities. By 

showing an immediate positive development impact through quick-win interventions, peace and stability brought 

back by security actors can be sustained and can make a transition from a humanitarian to a development response 

possible. This project’s specific added value lies in (a) strengthening crisis and conflict preparedness, response 

and coordination at the regional level to better prevent and mitigate regional fragility, and (b) addressing a set of 

priority activities which are expected to have a high development impact; are in areas where security allows for 

an intervention; and are complementary with other programs (clusters). 

 

22. Following a contextual regional rationale as outlined in the context section above, the project will translate 
this into a technical regional rationale and thus prioritize activities which are trans-border in nature and will 



 
The World Bank  
Lake Chad Region Recovery and Development Project (P161706) 

 
 

  
Oct 12, 2018 Page 12 of 22  

     

therefore help to restore and strengthen the regional system which has been negatively impacted by the Boko 

Haram crisis. The regional activities will be the following: (i) restoration of rural mobility and cross-border 

connectivity through the rehabilitation of critical rural roads and infrastructure (on the Lake Chad and around the 

Lake, and other intervention areas which are of regional importance), which will help to connect communities of 

all the participating three countries, and (ii) agriculture value chain development with a regional aspect combined 

with public productive investments which will facilitate and reinforce cross-border trade.15 In addition, the project 

will support a coordination and monitoring platform to reinforce regional dialogue and institutional capacity. 

 

23. The proposed financing instrument for this project is an Investment Project Financing (IPF) with total 
proposed IDA funds of US$225 million to be disbursed as grant and credit16. Following a pre-identification 

mission and the readiness of all three participating countries, the IDA funds are likely to be allocated as follows: 

US$60 million for Cameroon; US$45 million for Chad; and US$60 million for Niger. The proposed project is 

being processed as a Series of Projects (SOP) given that the three proposed project countries all deal with the 

same negative impacts of the Boko Haram crisis, similar underlying drivers of fragility and regional 

underdevelopment. The SOP approach will also allow for the participation of the Republic of Nigeria to opt into 

the program at a later date and according to the country’s needs and specific requirements. This project is the first 

proposed project of the SOP, and will focus on regional coordination and monitoring, rural connectivity and a 

few agricultural livelihood restoration priority activities. In addition, this first SOP will pilot social community 

engagement activities to support the process of restoring trust between and within communities. The second 

project in this SOP Series would build upon first achievements, expand livelihoods support and community 

engagement activities and also provide direct support to the beneficiaries’ access to basic socio-economic services 

in the Lake Chad Region. 

 

24. The project will embed essential features of ensuring citizen participation in prioritizing developmental 
needs including livelihoods opportunities to improve self-reliance of communities and social cohesion and greater 

demand for social accountability. Citizen Engagement mechanisms will be built into the project through (i) setting 

up effective grievance redress and beneficiary feedback mechanism, (ii) ensuring an intensive program of 

engagement with project stakeholders, (iii) deploying effective strategic communications and public education, 

and (iv) monitoring social impacts through annual stakeholder surveys. In addition, the project will identify local 

conflict and help set up conflict resolution mechanisms with the aim to restore trust among the community 

members and promote inclusion. The project will also use a targeted geographical development approach which 

combines a spatial and social lens. Targeted social inclusion will be ensured by using specific community-led 

processes to identify and reach vulnerable and systematically excluded people17, including young women, women 

from poorer households (including widows), and women with disabilities; and youth in general, at risk youth and 

youth affected by radicalization, involved in criminal networks, etc. Innovative citizen engagement approaches 

already tested in the region, mobilizing third party monitoring, ICT and CSOs will be explored.18 In addition, the 

concept for the operationalization of gender mainstreaming, in particular multi-sectoral prevention and response 

                                            
15 The component description provides examples of activities with a regional rationale which will be supported under this project; a detailed list of 
activities under Component 2 and 3 that have a regional public goods nature will be defined during project preparation. 
16 See a detailed overview of the project’s financing in the table on p. 13. 
17 The reasons for systematic exclusion from programs and economic participation are for a range of reasons, including social norms, lack of 

information, and inability to meet costs of participation in community institutions, including cost for transport. 
18 In Cameroon, for example, a successful Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) has been included in the context of the CEMAC Transport and Transit 

Facilitation Project. Important lessons learned from this project and other projects in the Region will be included in the design of this proposed Lake 

Chad Region Recovery and Development Project.

to gender-based violence (GBV) will, amongst others, be guided by a joint French Development Agency 

(AFD)/World Bank study which is currently being conducted.19 

 

25. Investments will be integrated and complemented by investments of the AFD’s Lake Chad Inclusive 
Economic and Social Recovery Program (RESILAC)20, initiatives on polder rehabilitation close to the Lake Chad, 

key WBG’s operations such as the CEMAC - Transport-Transit Facilitation Project in Cameroon, the Niger Rural 

Mobility and Connectivity Project, and the Refugees and Host Communities Support Projects in Chad and Niger, 

and interventions of humanitarian and development partners, and will be in alignment with the UN strategies for 

the Lake Chad Region21 and the Sahel Alliance. The following areas have been pre-identified as potential areas 

of intervention: (a) In Niger: Clusters of pepper productions along the main corridor of the national road from 

N’Guimi via Diffa to Zinder, two fishing communities and one cattle area in the North of the Lake Chad22; (b) in 

Cameroon: communes along the CEMAC corridor in Maroua and Septentrion and communes in the close vicinity 

to the Lake Chad (here, in particular fisheries), and (c) in Chad: a transport corridor connecting N’Djamena to the 

South of Cameroon and West via Bol and Baga Sol and polder areas in Tangal and Gueni. 

 

26. Security will be monitored closely and will inform project implementation. The project design will allow 
for flexibility in resource allocation across project components and geographic locations. Such flexibility is 

necessary to operate in a highly volatile environment with ongoing security concerns and people’s movements. 

A careful targeting of selected provinces and the use of a carefully chosen mix of activities combined with robust 

monitoring will help to reduce the risk that communities could become a target of violence as a consequence of 

investments made under this project.  
 

Component 1: Regional and national coordination platform and local capacity building 

 

27. This component will aim at reinforcing regional dialogue and institutional capacity by putting in place an 
analytical and monitoring platform of key vulnerability factors of the Region. It will also provide targeted capacity 

building of selected institutions at the regional, national and local levels to reinforce the regional cooperation and 

governance. This component will finance the following activities: 

 Sub-Component 1.1: Knowledge and Monitoring platform: An analytical and monitoring platform will be set 
up to foster knowledge exchange, collaboration and partnerships and to strengthen conflict and disaster early 

warning systems. This platform will be used for programmatic prioritization and coordination, policy 

harmonization23, regional dialogue at technical and strategic levels; as well as consolidate and strengthen 

already existing early warning systems (as e.g., the Continental Early Warning System (CEWS) established 

by the AU), provide capacity building to monitoring institutions and connect the systems across the three 

countries. Integrated and coordinated conflict and disaster early warning systems will allow stakeholders to 

anticipate disaster and conflict trends and better understand the rapidly changing dynamics of situations. Other 

topics that the platform could address and promote are citizen engagement, social inclusion and gender, 

                                            
19 The name of the study is Opportunity study: Strengthening the consideration of gender dynamics in the response to the Lake Chad crisis. 
20 This project aims at boosting the local economy by creating jobs for young people in rural areas and diversifying family-based production systems, 

strengthening social cohesion through psychosocial support for communities affected by Boko Haram's violence and providing institutional support 

for local authorities and civil society organizations. 
21 See above. 
22 Exact locations of these communities will be confirmed. 
23 One example of policy harmonization is a facilitation mechanism to support cross-border trade. 



 
The World Bank  
Lake Chad Region Recovery and Development Project (P161706) 

 
 

  
Oct 12, 2018 Page 14 of 22  

     

including strategies to prevent GBV. The platform will build on existing initiatives (in particular AFD and 

UN) and will engage researchers from the countries bordering Lake Chad and other key stakeholders, i.e. 

humanitarian workers, diplomats, international actors and national development programs. Data collected 

from monitoring will be confirmed based on the existing research data gaps24. The knowledge platform will 

have strong linkages with universities25 in each country bordering the Lake Chad. The platform will also 

conduct a review of the existing ICT services and the demand from users; and will use and test innovative 

technology, such as satellite images, geo-enabled data and other ICT tools to generate knowledge about the 

Lake Chad Region and its ecosystem, and to ensure monitoring in a challenging environment with many 

security constraints. Information and data gathered under this component will directly feed into the monitoring 

of the results of Component 2 and 3. 

 

 Sub-Component 1.2: Institutional capacity building to strengthen regional cooperation and local governance: 
The project will reinforce institutional capacity at regional, national and local levels and coordination of 

institutional stakeholders to strengthen regional dialogue on conflict prevention and local development in the 

Lake Chad Basin. This will be by supporting existing regional dialogue initiatives (such as the Lake Chad 

Basin Governors forum and other cross-border initiatives in the Lake Chad Region). Moreover, the project 

will support innovative citizen engagement mechanisms (access to information, participatory planning and 

budget, Grievance Redress Mechanisms) aimed at improving participatory planning and monitoring of 

investments around local plans and better institutional governance thus rebuilding trust between local 

populations and institutions. 

 

Component 2: Restoring Rural Mobility and Connectivity 

 

28. The component consists of civil works for rehabilitation of rural roads which are of regional importance, 
focusing on small-scale infrastructure provision to address immediate priority gaps in rural road connectivity in 

selected areas of the Lake Chad. The aim of this component is to improve access of communities to markets, 

especially regional markets, and to provide beneficiaries with an opportunity for short-term employment. 

Selection of the investments will be aligned with the activities of Component 3, in particular with regards to 

enhancing the logistics performance of the selected value chains on the infrastructure side and addressing the lack 

of mobility services or equipment, such as IMT (Intermediate Means of Transport). Road rehabilitation and 

maintenance sites will be assessed by considering the accessibility to basic services and a rapid mobility 

diagnostic based on (i) the calculation of RAI (rural access index), (ii) the accessibility by road to markets and 

health facilities such as centers offering emergency obstetrical services, and (iii) mobility needs and constraints 

of the population (through e.g. conducting some focus group discussions with selected communities). The civil 

works will be performed by using the Labor Intensive Public Works (LIPW) method for rural roads rehabilitation. 

This approach will contribute to promoting social cohesion while improving local governance and supporting 

economic recovery through wage jobs, community engagement (collective decision-making, collaborative 

behaviors, and community ownership, etc.) and improved regional road infrastructure. As part of the technical 

approach and to maximize cost efficiency and economic benefits, the use of a combination of regular full all 

weather standard rehabilitation/construction and environmental Oriented Spot Improvement Design to restore 

basic connectivity integrating duration of execution as a factor will be explored during project preparation. This 

component will consist of two sub-components: 

 

                                            
24 See the recent AFD and IRD study Crise et développement – La région du lac Tchad à l’épreuve de Boko Haram. 
25 Potential identified universities are: University of Diffa in Niger, University of N’Djamena, University of Maroua and University of Maiduguri.

 Sub-Component 2.1: Rural Roads Rehabilitation Preparatory and Technical Studies and Community 
Maintenance System: This sub-component will finance preparatory and other technical studies to be 

conducted during project preparation and implementation including preliminary conditions surveys, bills 

of quantities and cost calculations and support for environmental and social assessments. Gender specifics 

needs will be identified by the LDP and a mobility assessment (e.g., such needs could include dedicated 

sanitation facilities, street lighting, GBV, etc. at important logistical hubs or market areas). In addition, 

this component will support the development of a community maintenance system to promote the 

sustainability of investments, in terms of both jobs and roads. This could include the development of a 

small association or micro enterprise at community level for road maintenance. 

 

 Sub-Component 2.2: Rural Roads Rehabilitation Works: This sub-component will finance all civil works-
related expenses to beneficiaries for the preparation, execution, and supervision of works which aim at 

restoring rural mobility and connectivity on the Lake Chad and around the Lake. This component will 

complement productive investment activities under Sub-Component 3.1. This includes civil works to 

rehabilitate existing rural roads to obtain all-season road upgraded to respect defined technical standards, 

in particular targeted small rural roads to improve access of communities to regional markets.26 The 

financing of targeted dredging of navigation channels and construction/rehabilitation and maintenance of 

river docking piers infrastructure will also be explored.  

 

Component 3: Agriculture Investments and Value-Chain Development 

 

29. This component will promote public productive investments, value-chain development and citizen 
engagement and community participation activities in underserved communities in targeted areas. It has three 

sub-components: 

 

 Sub-Component 3.1: Public Productive Agriculture Investments: This sub-component will provide 
investment funds to communities through local planning processes to finance small investments for 

agriculture activities with a regional link. Activities that could be supported under this component are as 

follows: (i) Participatory local development needs assessments and local development plans, including the 

identification of areas of the agricultural value-chain that can be strengthened; and (ii) economic or 

productive investments, the construction/rehabilitation of rural markets, landing platforms for boats, small 

bridges and culverts, cleaning of channels, platforms (small commercial/logistics/processing platforms27), 

community storage facilities, the restoration of land quality through watershed management, irrigation 

perimeters, enclosures and waterpoints for agriculture and livestock use.28 

 Sub-Component 3.2: Livelihood Support and Value Chain Development: The project will provide targeted 
support for agriculture value chain development, including targeted support to agriculture production, pre- 

and post-harvest and marketing for selected products along the agriculture value chain (in particular red 

pepper, livestock and fish)29. The supported activities will have a cross-border potential, as for example 

                                            
26 The design of the civil works for rehabilitation of rural roads will take in mind potential risks due to extreme temperature, extreme precipitation, 

flooding and drought – risks to which the project locations are being exposed. 
27 This could, for example, include improved technologies for irrigation and fish processing. 
28 The design of the small-scale infrastructure work under this component will take in mind above identified climate and disaster risks to which the 

project locations are being exposed. 
29 Due to the importance of multiple livelihood strategies in the Region, the project will also focus on the interaction of livelihood with agricultural and 

fishery activities.

activities which support the production of trading goods will be prioritized, such as the red pepper road in 

Niger (which is then exported to Nigeria), livestock/fish support in Niger and Chad which would be traded 

to Cameroon and Nigeria, and products along the agriculture value chain that have a regional rational. 

Activities under this component could include: (i) strengthening areas of production and livelihood 

opportunities (irrigation, material, rehabilitation and development of selected polders and horticulture 

perimeters); (ii) provision of assets to enhance the production of sorghum, horticulture, rice, cattle, 

fisheries, etc. to increase the productivity of these sub-sectors;30 and (iii) targeted support aimed at 

facilitating and reinforcing selected trans-border trade for selected areas of value chain development (such 

as markets, storage facilities, etc.). Technical assistance on trans-border trade will also be explored. 

Innovative approaches for improving the agricultural value chain development will be identified during 

project preparation31. Activities of this component will particularly target women and female-headed 

households and youth and will thus serve both as a means of prevention (i.e. reducing women’s and 

youth’s vulnerability) and as a means of longer-term support for those affected by violence. Activities will 

also be chosen following a careful assessment of their level of positive impact on women and youth, and 

if these activities are accessible for women and youth. Furthermore, the negative impacts of post-harvest 

processing which address in particular women and children will also be reduced.32 Given the large youth 

population among the beneficiaries, targeted skills trainings to include life and entrepreneurship skills will 

also be explored based on needs. The approach for identifying, prioritizing, implementing and monitoring 
these activities will be participatory, therefore done in collaboration with local institutions and beneficiary 

communities to mitigate risks of conflicts between communities and contribute to reducing Gender Based 

Violence (GBV), including sexual violence.  

 

 Sub-component 3.3.: Citizen engagement and community participation activities: The project will provide 
targeted support to citizen engagement and community participation activities, such as psychosocial 

support and mentoring, flexible and adaptable community reintegration programs, sports and cultural 

community activities, and different campaigns, such as GBV prevention, de-stigmatization campaigns and 

the engagement of youth and women as conflict and climate and disaster risk management champions will 

also be supported during the planning and implementation processes. These activities will help to restore 

trust among the population and will reduce the risk of further stigmatization, exclusion, radicalization and 

violence, including GBV, etc. These activities would also be complementarity to UNDP’s support to the 

DDR process in the Lake Chad Region, and in particular to the activities of a DD facility which UNDP is 

currently assisting to establish. 
 

 

 

Component 4: Project Management 

 

30. This component will finance the planning, implementation, and technical oversight of program activities; 
and effective social and environmental safeguards management, financial management, and procurement. The 

arrangements for project coordination will be determined at preparation stage. Relevant government agencies at 

                                            
30 The activities will complement the activities under the sub-component 2.1. and especially with regards to the provision of small scale post-harvest 

infrastructure which strengthens the agriculture value chain. 
31 The project may also include support for diversification out of climate-sensitive livelihoods; this will be identified during project preparation. 
32 See Central Africa Coastal Fisheries report (P165882). Fish smoking is done with basic ovens that have negative impacts on the products themselves 

and on the health of the processors mainly women and their children. The FAO, for example, has recently developed a new type of smoking oven that 

reduces the exposure to toxic smoke and chemicals, while also reducing the amount of fuel needed for smoking.

the regional, national, sub-national and local levels will be involved in the implementation process with adequate 

capacity building support. The following activities will be included: Communication, Monitoring and Evaluation 

(M&E) arrangements, including the set-up of a Management Information System (MIS), outcome/impact 

evaluations at mid-term and end-of-project; and measures for enhanced transparency and accountability. 

Innovative implementation mechanisms (use of Third Party Monitoring, digital monitoring/supervision tools, 

such as satellite data) will be considered given the specific security challenges. Data produced with the help of 

the Knowledge and Monitoring platform as outlined in Sub-Component 1.1. will feed directly into project 

supervision and oversight. Project Management will be undertaken in close coordination and collaboration with 

security and justice forces and mechanisms for identifying risk of violence at various stage of project 

implementation will be established so as to allow the project to operate in such an insecure environment. 
 
  

Component 5: Contingent Emergency Response Component (CERC) 

 

31. The project will operate in a highly complex and volatile environment. This zero-funded component will 
allow the governments to quickly mobilize funds in the event of an emergency that will require immediate 

recovery and reconstruction response. The detailed design of this component will be developed during project 

preparation.

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The project will be implemented in several areas that border Lake Chad, initially in Niger, Cameroon and Chad. The 

following areas have been pre-identified as potential areas of intervention: (a) In Niger: Clusters of pepper productions 
along the main corridor of the national road from N’Guimi via Diffa to Zinder, two fishing communities and one cattle 
area in the North of the Lake Chad ; (b) in Cameroon: communes along the CEMAC corridor in Maroua and Septentrion 
and communes in the close vicinity to the Lake Chad (here, in particular fisheries), and (c) in Chad: a transport corridor 
connecting N’Djamena to the South of Cameroon and West via Bol and Baga Sol and polder areas in Tangal and Gueni. 
These are low density areas in terms of population but represent important transport corridors for goods and produce for 
the region. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
Cameroon: The country has a comprehensive environmental and social legal framework, including the 1996 

Environmental Law and its implementation decrees including a decree on ESIA.  The Ministry of Environment, Protection 
of Nature and Sustainable Development (MINEPDED) is responsible for approval of ESIAs/ESMPs/RAPs and ESMPs/RAPs 
compliance monitoring. The Ministries has divisional entities that ensure local ESMPs monitoring compliance. The Order 
No 0010/MINEP of April 3, 2013 requires to set up in each Division of the country, a Committee for the technical and 
administrative supervision of ESMP. However, only one Divisional committee has not been set up in the Project. The 
decentralized entities remain weak and have limited human and logistic capacities.  The country has experience in 
monitoring environmental and social safeguards policies of World Bank financed projects. 
 
Chad: The country has an environmental and social legal framework that includes the legislative framework includes Law 

n ° 14/PR/98 of August 17, 1998 defining the general principles of environment protection. The Country published also on 
August 4, 2010 decree n °630 regulating the Environmental Impact Assessment and on November 29, 2012, the EIA 
preparation general guide. The Ministry in charge of Environment is responsible for approval of ESIAs/ESMPs through 
DEELCPN. This Department remains very poorly staffed and staffs that are there are poorly equipped. The country has 
experience in monitoring the implementation of World Bank financed projects.  The  capacity to deal with environmental 
and social safeguards remains very weak.  
 
Niger:  The country has a comprehensive environmental and social legal framework that includes the Law n ° 2018-28 of 

May 14, 2018 determining the fundamental principles on Environmental Assessments. The Bureau Environmental 
Assessments and Impact Studies (BEEEI), under the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development 
responsible for approval of ESIAs/ESMPs and ESMPs compliance monitoring. In practice, BEEEI lacks decentralized 
entities. BEEEI has some skilled staffs but the number of staff remains limited with regards of the workload and 
responsibilities to be undertaken. BEEEI has very limited logistic  capacities. BEEEI has experience in monitoring World 
Bank safeguards. 
 
During the project preparation, an in-depth assessment of the three borrower's institutional capacities will be 

undertaken and relevant mitigation measures will be proposed.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The proposed project is categorized as category B 
project under this policy, because activities under 
Component 2 and 3 are expected to generate 
potential adverse social and environmental risks and 
impacts that will be limited in scale. Most of them will 
be site specific within the target area, few if any of 
them will be irreversible and in most cases, mitigation 
measures can be designed. As the identification of 
sites and works is not yet finalized, an ESMF will be 
prepared for each country, consulted upon, and 
disclosed both in-country and at the World Bank 
website prior to appraisal. In addition, a GBV risk 
assessment for each country will be undertaken in 
order to provide recommendations for how to 
mainstream mitigation measures appropriate for each 
context into the country components. 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No 
This policy is not triggered as the activities do not 
intend to use private sectors activities as described 
under this policy. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

OP 4.04 is triggered as the Lake Chad has been 
recognized by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of 
International Importance (i.e. the Lake Chad is a 
"Ramsar site"). While specific project sites are 
currently not known, it is likely that some project 
activities might take place in the vicinity of the Lake 
Chad. Provisions and further information on 
appropriate risk mitigation strategies and measures in 
relation to the site(s) will be included in each of the 
country specific ESMFs. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 

This policy is not triggered as the project activities do 
not expect to affect negatively on the health and 
quality of forests and/or finance activities that would 
do so. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

Although procurement of pesticides is not envisaged 
under the project, it is possible that the activities with 
regards to the strengthening of agriculture production 
will lead to an increased use of pesticides. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 
The Physical Cultural Resources Policy (OP 4.11) is 
triggered because Cameroon, Chad and Niger are 
viewed as rich cultural heritage area. The Lake Chad is 



 
The World Bank  
Lake Chad Region Recovery and Development Project (P161706) 

 
 

  
Oct 12, 2018 Page 20 of 22  

     

also classified as a World Natural Heritage Site by 
UNESCO. Though it is unknown at this time which sites 
may contain such resources, due to the lack of 
specifics on the locations, size, scale of planned 
investments under the project, it was judged prudent 
to use caution when implementing the productive 
investments, especially the civil works. During the 
development of the country specific ESMFs, physical 
cultural resources will be taken into consideration and 
a baseline will be defined. The ESMFs will include clear 
procedures that will be required for identification, 
protection of cultural property from death and 
treatment of discovered artefacts, and which will be 
included in standards bidding documents. The ESMFs 
will also provide procedures for handling chance finds 
(during implementation of the project's activities). 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 TBD 

A social assessment to determine if there are 
Indigenous peoples in the project area or that will be 
impacted by project activities will be undertaken. If 
there are Indigenous peoples, an IPPF or IPP will be 
prepared for the specific country to provide guidance 
during implementation. The IPPFs or IPPs will be 
disclosed in country and on the World Bank website 
prior to appraisal. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

OP 4.12 is triggered due to the potential impacts 
related to civil works under Components 2 & 3, which 
may lead to minor land acquisition, loss of assets 
and/or access to resources. A Resettlement Policy 
Framework for each country will be prepared or 
updated, consulted upon, approved and disclosed 
both in-country and at the World Bank website prior 
to appraisal. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No 
The policy is not triggered as the project activities will 
not involve the construction of a dam or being 
dependent upon an existing dam. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 

The policy is triggered because some of the proposed 
investments under component 2.2. (e.g. targeted 
dredging/navigation channels/rehabilitation and 
construction of docking pier infrastructure) and 
possibly also 3.1. (e.g. landing platforms for boats, 
small bridges and culverts, cleaning of channels) will 
take place on an international waterway (Lake Chad), 
as per OP 7.50. As a consequence, other riparian 
countries will be notified of the proposed project and 
the Lake Chad Basin Commission will be involved as 
appropriate and as according to Bank procedures.

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
The policy is not triggered as the project does not 
anticipate any disputes in the targeted area. 

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Apr 25, 2019 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
RPFs will be simultaneously prepared (or updated in the case of PNDP in Cameroon) for each country prior to appraisal. 

The information obtained during the preparation will be used to prepare the Appraisal stage ISDS.

B. Introduction and Context 

 
Country Context 

The complex challenges in the North-East (NE) and the broader Lake Chad region are among the most 

pressing issues facing the Federal and NE State administrations in Nigeria.   

Recent resurgence in conflict exacerbates the humanitarian crisis 

1. Following the election of President Buhari in 2015, the Nigerian Government took steps to address 
the insurgency in the NE, with support from neighboring countries and the African Union through 
the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF). They appointed new military leadership, created a 
Theatre Headquarters in Maiduguri and increased resources committed to NE activities. Significant 
territory formerly controlled by Boko Haram (BH) was reclaimed and relative peace restored, allowing 
for the return of at least 1.6 million internally displaced people (IDPs) to their homes or nearby, more 
than 750,000 of these in Adamawa State and over 650,000 in Borno. Large-scale international 
humanitarian aid averted famine in 2017.   

2. However, security in the NE has deteriorated sharply since 2018. Attacks have increased in Borno 
State, as well as nearby areas of Adamawa and Yobe (together the ‘BAY’ states). Islamic State West 
Africa Province (ISWAP), which split from BH in 2016, has developed into the more potent threat, 
employing more sophisticated military tactics and dominating swathes of northern Borno around its 
strongholds on Lake Chad. Major attacks, including those on Baga, Monguno and Rann in December 
2018 and January 2019, have triggered renewed large-scale displacement of people. Meanwhile, BH 
continues attacks on the population in south-east Borno and northern Adamawa, absorbing military 
attention and preventing a stronger response further north. 



 

The World Bank  
Additional Financing for MCRP (P173104) 

 

 

  
Jan 30, 2020 Page 4 of 16  

 

3. Around 7.1 million of the BAY states’ total population of 13.4 million need humanitarian assistance 
in 2019, according to the 2019-21 Nigeria Humanitarian Response Strategyi, which seeks to reach 
6.2 million people. Around 1.7 million face food insecurity (CH3-5). Some two million people are 
internally displaced across the BAY states, a net increase of more than 100,000 since December 2018. 
Around 230,000 Nigerian refugees are in neighboring Cameroon, Chad and Niger. Within Nigeria, 
around one million people are now estimated to live in areas, mainly in the far north of Borno, that 
are inaccessible to humanitarian actors. Approximately 60 percent of the total number of IDPs live in 
host communities, while 20 percent reside in camps.  

4. The conflict has intensified the historical social, economic and development disadvantages of the 
NE. The NE poverty rate was the second highest in the country in 2013, after only the North-West, at 
nearly 48 percent against 33 percent nationallyii. The NE literacy rate in 2013 stood at just 22 percent 
for women and 40 percent for men. The NE has long suffered from poor access to health care and 
sanitation services, with under-five mortality of 160 per 1,000 live births, against 90 in South-West, 
the best performing region. The proportion of children age 12-23 months received all basic 
vaccinations was only 14 percent in the NE, compared with 52 percent for South-South.  

 

Government and partners have responded strongly, but unmet needs remain considerable 

5. The 2016 Recovery and Peace Building Assessment (RPBA) for NE Nigeriaiii estimated the economic 
impact of the crisis at nearly US$9 bn across the six affected states: Borno, Yobe, Adamawa, Taraba, 
Gombe and Bauchi. It put recovery and peacebuilding needs at US$6.7 bn, covering three strategic 
areas of intervention: US$150.5 m for peacebuilding, stability, and social cohesion; US$6.0 bn for 
rebuilding infrastructure and restoring social services; and US$473.5 m for economic recovery. The 
RPBA was prepared by the Federal Government, led by the Vice President’s Office, and the 
governments of the six affected states, with support from the European Union, the United Nations 
and the World Bank.  

6. In June 2016, the Federal Government released the Buhari Plan as the blueprint for humanitarian 
relief and socioeconomic stabilization of the NE, as well as durable solutions for displaced persons. 
The Buhari Plan incorporated the RPBA’s assessment of needs and established the scope and 
framework for targeted interventions, as well as defining the national vision and objectives for long-
term stability and economic redevelopment of the region. The Plan is built around 10 pillars, 
comprising safety and security, good governance, infrastructure, agriculture, health, education, 
entrepreneurship, women and youth empowerment, regional planning and strategic growth, 
environment, border security and international trade development, and solid minerals. 

7. Major programs are underway, but the considerable needs identified by the RPBA are far from 
being met, and much of the Buhari Plan remains to be implemented. NE recovery and peacebuilding 
efforts supported by the African Development Bank, the European Union, Germany, the United 
Kingdom, the United Nations system, the United States, the World Bank and other international 
partners total around US$1.6 bn. However, reliable data on total government or partner expenditures 
in the NE and overall implementation progress is not available. For the broader region, donors pledged 
US$ 2.13 bn for humanitarian and recovery activities for 2018 and beyond at the High-Level 
Conference on the Lake Chad Region in September 2018,iv of which US$985.5 m was for humanitarian 
activities. For NE Nigeria, the Humanitarian Response Plan seeks US$ 848 million, while the 2019-2020 
Nigeria Regional Refugee Response Planv aims to raise a further $135 million for 2019.

8. In support of the RPBA and the Buhari Plan, the World Bank has approved US$775 million in IDA 
financing for the six NE States since 2016, the largest commitment among international 
development partners. The program addresses urgent needs, restores basic services and livelihoods 
and rebuilds infrastructure.  It has included additional financing for six existing projects for health, 
education, social protection and agriculture/food security, as well as a US$200 million Multi-Sectoral 
Crisis Recovery Project (MCRP) for North-East Nigeria.  

 
9. The MCRP has been effective since February 16, 2018 and has recently undergone its Mid-Term 

Review (MTR) in November 2019. Despite a 10-month gap from Board-approval to effectiveness, the 

Project has picked up significant pace over the last 18 months and its current implementation progress 

has been satisfactory, based on its financial progress and the current status of results achievement on 

the ground. The likelihood of achievement of the Project Development Objective (PDO) of the 

intended project outcomes and results is now rated as high. As at the Mid-Term, total project 

disbursements from the World Bank to the Government of Nigeria were at USD 95 million (of the 

USD200 million IDA Credit), representing 46% of the total project allocation amount. 

 
Rational for Additional Financing  

10. The Federal Government of Nigeria has requested that the country be included in the regional 
program supported by the proposed IDA Lake Chad Region Recovery and Development Project 
(PROLAC, P161706). PROLAC ($170 million) has been in preparation since FY18 for three of the four 
countries that border the Lake: Cameroon, Chad and Niger, slated for FY20 Board consideration. The 
participation of Nigeria, the fourth country, is important for the PROLAC program to have complete 
regional coverage, and because Nigeria is the largest country by far and the epicenter of the Boko 
Haram conflict, the impacts and drivers of which PROLAC seeks to address.  

 
11. PROLAC’s proposed development objective is to contribute to the recovery of the Lake Chad Region 

through supporting regional coordination and crisis monitoring, connectivity and agricultural 
livelihoods in selected provinces of the participating countries. It includes three main components: 
Component 1: Regional and National Coordination Platform and Local Capacity Building ($20 m) - This 
aims to reinforce regional dialogue and data collection and dissemination, institutional capacity 
building and knowledge sharing, including a Lake Chad Data and Knowledge Platform. Component 2: 
Restoring Rural Mobility and Connectivity ($75 m) aims to improve access of communities to markets, 
especially regional markets, and to provide beneficiaries with an opportunity for short-term 
employment, through civil works for rehabilitation of rural roads of regional importance. Component 
3: Agriculture Investments and Value-Chain Development ($60m) will promote public productive 
investments, value-chain development, citizen engagement and community participation activities in 
project areas.  

 
Situation of Urgent Need of Assistance 

12. An ‘Additional Financing for Restructuring’ is proposed for MCRP in the amount of $176 million, 
with the main purposes: (a) addressing the huge unmet needs of the three most affected states of 
Borno, Yobe and Adamawa (the originally estimated needs for NE recovery and stabilization were to 
the tune of US$6 billion, of which only about 1/3rds are estimated to have been financed through 



 

The World Bank  
Additional Financing for MCRP (P173104) 

 

 

  
Jan 30, 2020 Page 6 of 16  

 

various government and development partner programs, and which will require the redesign of, and 
the addition of supplementary activities within, the existing project components ; (b) the MCRP 
implementation model has proven successful in putting the State Governments firmly in the 
leadership and implementation role for recovery and peace building, thus helping restore state-citizen 
trust, the erosion of which was a key structural driver of crisis; (c) the additional financing will serve 
the objective of bringing Nigeria into the Lake Chad regional program, which will also entail bringing 
in new components on agricultural value chain, rural access and regional connectivity. Given the 
consistency and complementarity of MCRP and PROLAC objectives and activities, and the need to 
bring Nigeria into the regional program quickly, the Country Management Unit and task teams 
consider that an Additional financing operation for MCRP, prepared in parallel with the finalization of 
PROLAC and presented to the Board as a single package with PROLAC, is the best mechanism for doing 
this. In the main PROLAC project, adjustments will be made to the regional elements, to promote the 
full inclusion of Nigeria. In addition to a regional focus, adapting MCRP to bring it into the program 
supported by PROLAC, will bring a more strategic focus on agricultural livelihoods and value chains 
and economic recovery, a natural evolution for MCRP.  

 
13. The restructuring will also be used to lay the groundwork for adapting MCRP to become an 

integrated central platform for the channeling of broader World Bank assistance to Borno, 
Adamawa and Yobe, the three states most affected by the Boko Haram crisis. Five additional 
financing operations, which were part of the Bank’s 2016-2017 $775 million Boko Haram response 
package along with MCRP, are set to close before the end of FY20. The restructuring will be used to 
further develop MCRP’s multi-sectoral approach, to allow it to absorb activities, and potentially 
unspent IDA funding from these five operations, which cover health and education service delivery, 
agriculture and food security, social protection and community development. This approach is also in 
line with the need for spatial sector consolidation of Bank projects towards increased impact and 
implementation arrangements streamlining. 

 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
14. As foreseen in the MCRP PAD, the Presidential Committee for the Northeast Initiative (PCNI) has 

been replaced as federal apex institution for recovery in the northeast of Nigeria by the Northeast 
Development Commission (NEDC). As part of this, the NEDC has taken over from the PCNI as the main 
Federal counterpart for MCRP with responsibility for overall coordination. The NEDC is anchored in 
the newly created Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, 
while PCNI had come under the Office of the Vice President. The NEDC is a statutory body (unlike the 
PCNI, which was mandated through a time-bound Presidential executive order) and is responsible for 
the oversight and coordination of all humanitarian, recovery and development work in the six states 
of northeast Nigeria.  In addition to the coordination of multilateral development bank programs, at 
the federal level it is expected to lead program coordination among federal government MDAs and 
development partners, and vertical coordination between regional, federal and state level institutions 
and planning processes. 

 

Each of the BAY States has developed different coordination arrangements. In Borno, the Ministry 
of Reconstruction, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (MRRR) has overall responsibility for recovery 
planning and coordination. In addition, a statutory coordination agency has been created, under the 
auspices of the MRRR; Adamawa has created its own MRRR and a multilateral coordination office has

been formed within the State Government Secretariat. Meanwhile, Yobe has recently set up a state 
level Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management.  

 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
Original PDO  
The objectives of the Project are to: (a) support the Government of Nigeria towards rehabilitating and improving critical 
service delivery infrastructure, improve the livelihood opportunities of conflict and displacement-affected communities, 
and strengthen social cohesion in the North East Participating States of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa; and (b) in the event 
of an Eligible Crisis or Emergency, to provide immediate and effective response to said Eligible Crisis or Emergency 
 
Current PDO  
To improve access to basic services and livelihood opportunities for the crisis-affected communities of Adamawa, Borno, 
and Yobe States, and enhance coordination among these States and other Lake Chad countries. 
 
Changes to the PDO are made to reflect the project’s regional dimension and removal of the aim to “strengthen social 
cohesion”. Selected targets have also been revised upwards, to accommodate some over-shooting to-date, with costs in 
some areas having proved lower than estimated originally. Additional sectoral indicators have been absorbed from the 
sectoral programs (AF operations) phasing out, while the indicators related to regional coordination are the same as the 
one under PROLAC.   
 

Key Results 
Achievement of the intended PDO will continue to be monitored by the following indicators: 
 

• Number of direct project beneficiaries (percentage of which are women) 

• Percentage of direct project beneficiaries who are female  

• Number of beneficiaries that have improved livelihood opportunities with project support (o/w 
female) 

• Number of beneficiaries with additional or improved access to service delivery infrastructure 
 
New PDO-level indicators include: 

• Increase in yield among farmers benefiting from agricultural benefits (percentage increase from 

baseline)   

• Number of peace groups that promote collective action  

• Number of government officials adopting new skills of peace building, conflict sensitivity and 
crisis recovery management 

• Number of school children benefiting from rehabilitated and re-equipped schools (o/w IDP 
children) 

• Number of women benefiting from improved health facilities 

• Joint statement and action plan agreed during an annual coordination meeting with 
participation of the four countries (two measurements: yes or no – measure every year; and 
from year two: % of agreed actions implemented)

D. Project Description  
 

1. Strategic Shifts: From a broader strategic perspective, the AF is a natural evolution of MCRP from a 
program focused on urgent needs, early recovery interventions and reconstruction, to one that looks toward 
long-term recovery and development of livelihoods and the economy. Going forward, the expanded MCRP will 
have (a) a stronger focus on basic services, with the addition of health and education service provision activities; 
(b) greater emphasis on livelihoods and employment generation; (c) a new lens for transport support on 
enhancing connectivity, on the Lake Chad region, as well as locally, linking farms to markets and people to 
sources of employment; (d) continued strong support for peacebuilding and the strengthening of social 
cohesion; and (e) the fostering of regional stabilization  as a main priority.  

 

• Component 1:  
o The component name will be changed to: Peace building and strengthening social cohesion and 

livelihoods, to reflect a stronger emphasis on – and a more strategic approach to - supporting 
livelihoods, as well as a move from an emphasis on shorter term stability to longer term 
development  

o Consistent with this, a more strategic approach to support for livelihoods, including agricultural 
ones. For agricultural, this will involve moving on from MCRP’s current emphasis on distribution 
of seeds, small ruminants and basic tools to subsistence farmers, to a broader range of support 
with greater emphasis on sustainability.  

o A deepening of community engagement on planning, prioritization and oversight, through 
stronger community structures, potentially absorbing some of those created through the 
Community and Social Development (CSDP, P157898) and FADAMA (P131075) projects.  

o Inclusion of labor-intensive works (cash for work) activities, to be funded by community grants. 

• Component 2:  
o Complementary to the direct livelihoods support under Component 1, the inclusion of new 

activities for the restoration and strengthening of infrastructure and services related to 
agriculture, livestock and fisheries, including support for key stages of priority value chains and 
the development of Agricultural Clusters.  

o The inclusion of new activities for enhancing rural access/mobility and markets  
o Consolidation on Citizen’s engagements, Community Participation and Ownership Structures 

established by the  Community and Social Development Project (CSDP - P157898) 
o Addition of activities to strengthen service provision for health and education, absorbing 

activities underway through the Nigeria States Health Investment Project (NSHIP -P120798) and 
State Education Program Investment Project (SEPIP – P122124), possibly including  grants to 
school management committees and incentive payments to teachers - or introducing alternative 
mechanisms for improving service delivery that are closer to the original design of MCRP and 
achieve the same objectives of activities now under NSHIP and SEPIP.   

o Improving Operations and Maintenance (O&M) for existing and planned infrastructure 
subprojects under MCRP and the MCRP AF to enhance the sustainability of investments, such as 
for the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and transport sector, by introducing a system of 
performance-based grants or central resource pools in each state for O&M. 
 

2. Cross-cutting priorities of climate change adaptation and mitigation and labor-intensive public works: 
Where appropriate, project activities under both Component 1 & 2 will, from both a design and resource

allocation perspective aim to increase climate sensitivity. Labor-intensive public works (LIPW/cash for work 
(CfW) will be used as a means of both delivering project outputs and creating local employment (with an 
emphasis on women and youth), through dedicated programs under Component 1 and as an approach that can 
be included in the design – and particularly in the maintenance strategies – for the larger infrastructure works 
included in Component Two. 

3. Component 3: Technical assistance and programme management support that focuses on the 
strengthening of institutional capacities for the coordination of recovery programming in the NE, and of MCRP 
implementation capacities. 

Proposed Changes:  

o Build capacity of Nigeria NE actors (including State governments, academia and teachers and 
students from research institutes other relevant stakeholders) to engage regionally through 
coordination, knowledge management, collaboration with the Lake Chad Basin Commission 
knowledge platform being supported under PROLAC.  

o Host thematic dialogues with academic and research institutions on the Lake Chad Region. 

 

E. Implementation 
 

Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 
4. Implementation of Components 1 and 2 remains broadly as described in the MCRP PAD. That is, Component 1 is 
implemented directly by the State PCUs through service delivery contractors with technical oversight from relevant 
MDAs, while Component 2 is implemented by state MDAs with PCU oversight. However, the North East Development 
Commission (NEDC) has provided a jointly agreed proposal on implementation arrangements with States, that 
maximizes flexibility that may need to be made across the States. The proposal provides a roadmap for the gradual 
transfer, harmonization and ultimate integration of existing institutional capacities into the implementation 
arrangements of the MCRP-AF. Further refining of the plan will be reflected in the Project Implementation Manual (PIM). 
Relevant capacities of the existing PCUs of the soon closing additional financing projects will be either merged or 
otherwise connected to the MCRP implementation arrangements.

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 OPS_SAFEGUARD_SUMMARY_TBL 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The parent project  has recorded some implementation challenges and the task team has worked with the client to  
usually addresses as they arise. The following are the achievements recorded in the implementation of the safeguards 
instruments that have been cleared and disclosed: 1ESIA, 15 ESMPs have so far been prepared under the parent 
project and are at different stages of implementation. Also about 114 grievances have so far been recorded and 
satisfactorily  resolved across participating states under the parent project.  
 
Environmental and Social Safeguards Policies were strictly adhered to as at mid-term of the parent project. Safeguard 
Action plan was prepared and disclosed prior to implementation. The investment plan was screened and site-specific 
safeguards instruments were prepared, cleared and disclosed through the appropriate channels. A number of 
trainings were conducted to improve the capacity of ESSU (environmental and social safeguards units) of the PCUs. 
Several supervision missions were conducted to ensure implementation of the cleared and disclosed safeguards 
instruments.  
 
It is clarified by the task team that there are no new institutional arrangements per se, as per the transition plan 
proposed by the government for the “integration” of parts of existing staff resources and assets of NSHIP, SEPIP, CSDP 



 

The World Bank  
Additional Financing for MCRP (P173104)

and FADAMA into the MCRP institutional arrangements. The existing PCUs/PIUs of these projects will cease to exist 
and only relevant staff will be transferred to boost the capacity of MCRP. In addition, the reference projects were 
implemented in geographical zones that included that of MCRP and the envisaged risks of MCRP AF, are materially 
consistent with the risk ratings of the original projects (NSHIP, SEPIP, CSDP and FADAMA). Further, the letter and spirit 
of the proposed integration is that existing activities of these projects will be adjusted, molded and assimilated into 
the design and implementation arrangements of the MCRP, rather than their continuation in the present form, and 
hence such transition and eventual integration will be organic in nature and scope, rather than a simultaneous 
continuation of the existing projects parallel to MCRP. Where new activities are added on MCRP on account of such 
integration, these activities will be fine-tuned to fall within the objectives and implementation modus operandi of the 
MCRP, and such that these activities would be screened to ensure that they are of similar environmental and social 
risk.  The task team does agree that such new activities should continue to be governed by the safeguards instruments 
of their parent projects. 
 
In the above vein, it is submitted that new policies are not expected to be triggered on account of the integration of 
these projects into the MCRP, as the activities if redesigned will fall within the safeguards instruments of the MCRP, or 
if continued in their original form, will fall within the safeguards instruments of the parent projects. A clause could be 
included in the Financing Agreement to ensure that the continuation of the use of safeguards instruments of the 
parent projects for MCRP is given legal effect. To this end, the task team will remove any references in the Project 
Paper to triggering of new Safeguards policies. 
 
However, the key environmental and social risk management concerns of the ongoing project that might be relevant 
to the MCRP-AF include: (i) possible soil, water and air contamination, loss of vegetation,  and noise nuisance, 
vibration, traffic congestion due to the planned construction and rehabilitation activities, possible exposure to health 
care wastes, potential injuries from accidents, incidents and near misses, poor management of sludge; and (ii) 
potential adverse social impacts that might result from the need for land acquisition and/or the loss of access to 
economic assets and livelihoods due to planned rehabilitation and investment activities as well as GBV risks.  As part 
of the project preparation, the team has updated the Safeguards Action Plan for the Project. Immediately after Board 
Approval , the client will prepare ESMF and RPF which will outline steps to be  followed in preparing site specific 
safeguards instruments (ESIA, ESMP, RAP) when the locations of the project activities are determined during 
implementation, including mechanism for GBV prevention and response when necessary. 
 
In summary, there are no long-term impacts anticipated. The environmental and social impacts are expected to be 
site-specific and can be managed to an acceptable level. 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
Activities being planned under this project will have limited social and environmental impacts. In principle, MCRP does 
not envision to fund large-scale new infrastructure development projects (e.g. dams or power stations), but rather 
small to medium size rural infrastructural rehabilitation and reconstruction works in localized sites across the BAY 
areas. Much of the Project will focus on medium size rehabilitation and re-construction projects of schools, health 
centers, public buildings, water sources, roads and bridges. The anticipated scale of potential adverse environmental 
or social impacts on human populations are site-specific, few if any of them are irreversible and in most cases, 
mitigation measures could be designed to address the impacts. 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
The MCRP, in view of the fact that it is responding to an emergency situation, will not in principle fund large-scale new 
infrastructure development projects that could potentially have long-term and irreversible impacts. Instead, the 



 

The World Bank  
Additional Financing for MCRP (P173104) 

 

 

  
Jan 30, 2020 Page 12 of 16  

 

proposed project focuses on small to medium size rehabilitation and re-construction projects that can be easily 
managed at the community level. A flexible and programmatic approach is being taken and will adapt to the evolving 
context and environment on the ground. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Specifically, the project will be processed through IPF Policy paragraph 12 (a) that allows for the deferral of the 
preparation of social and environmental assessment documents till implementation. Immediately after Board 
Approval , the client will prepare ESMF and RPF which will outline steps to be  followed in preparing site specific 
safeguards instruments (ESIA, ESMP, PMP, RAP) when the locations of the project activities are determined during 
implementation. The instruments would be consulted upon and publicly disclosed. The Project, including the ESAP 
have satisfactory calendar, budget and clear institutional responsibilities for the implementation of measures related 
to safeguard policies. In addition, costs related to safeguard policy measures are being included in the project cost 
tables. 
 
Each site approved for support by the project will be eligible for financing only when an Environmental and Social 
Management Plan (ESMP) and RAP (if required) satisfactory to the Bank have been completed and disclosed. Under 
the parent project, the client has so far prepared and disclosed 1ESIA, 15 ESMPs have so far been prepared under the 
parent project and are at different stages of implementation 
 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders include beneficiaries and local communities in the project’s areas, local NGOs working in the 
project area, the respective State Governments of Borno Adamawa and Yobe (BAY), and participating Ministries, 
Departments and Agencies (MDAs). 
 
Environmental and Social Safeguards preparation, review and approval procedure to be followed under this project 
shall be consistent with the requirements from the Federal Ministry of Environment of Nigeria as specified in the 
Environmental Assessment Act (Decree No. 86 of 1992, hereinafter the EIA Act), the World Bank’s OP 4.01.  
Compliance with this procedure will constitute part of the evaluation methodology for proposed subprojects prior to 
approval for MCRP support.  The steps in the process are project screening, environmental and social assessment and 
instrument preparation, EIA review and approval, and oversight of implementation.  Stakeholder consultation is an 
integral part of the preparation process, and public disclosure and comment are necessary prior to the decision to 
accept or reject a proposed subproject on the basis of environmental and social information. The procedure for 
consultations on subprojects should conform to OP 4.01 and the EIA Act.  OP 4.01 requires consultation with 
stakeholders. For MCRP, safeguards work on subprojects entails an initial consultation of affected populations and 
interested NGOs as well as relevant agencies of federal, state and local governments, to inform them about the 
proposed activity and solicit recommendations, questions and concerns to be addressed in environmental and social 
assessment.  Once drafts of safeguards documents are completed by the client, they must be cleared by the Bank and 
disclosed. Both Nigeria and the Bank require public disclosure of the safeguard instruments (ESIAs, ESMPs, PMPs, RAPs 
and Audits-as the case may be).  The Bank’s requirements are the most detailed and, to comply with them, safeguards 
documents for MCRP subprojects will be disclosed, at public locations in the area affected by the project as well as in 
appropriate State and Federal agencies, and on the Bank’s external website.  Following a time period adequate for the 
review of those documents, which for MCRP is defined as 30 calendar days for Category B.  It is a policy of the Bank 
that consultations and disclosure should be in form and language accessible to the stakeholders, and that consultation

Jan 30, 2020 Page 13 of 16  

 

should continue throughout project implementation. This consultation that has started during project preparation will 
be continued during implementation. In addition, the MCRP has a robust Grievance Redress Mechanism (GRM) that 
enables project beneficiaries to log in complaints and receive swift and fair resolution in real time. 
 
Under the parent project, consultations have been held with stakeholders at different levels: (a) As part of 
environmental and social screening for sub projects; and (b) During the preparation of site-specific safeguards 
instruments. So far 16 safeguards instruments 1ESIA and 15 ESMPs have been prepared and disclosed by the project.

Comments 
The proposed project activities include the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure which could result in adverse 
environmental and social impacts thereby triggering OP/BP 4.01. However, considering the limited scale and 
magnitude of rehabilitation and improvement works as well as the confinement of activities to existing footprints, the 
proposed operation is classified as category ‘B’. At this point in time, the locations of the activities that will be financed 
by the project is not known in sufficient details. Site specific safeguards instruments such as ESIAs, stand-alone ESMPs, 
RAPs and Audits (when necessary) will be prepared, consulted upon and disclosed by the proponents prior to the 
commencement of civil works, and the relevant measures including E&S clauses clearly incorporated in contracts.

The review of this Safeguards has been Deferred.  
 
Comments 
The need for involuntary resettlement or land acquisition in specific subproject areas will only be known during project 
implementation, when site-specific plans are available. Therefore, subprojects will be screened for applicability of the 
resettlement policy and in case any activity or subproject involves land acquisition, a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) or 
Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) will be prepared in compliance with the Bank policy and Nigerian laws 
prior to actual implementation of the activity or subproject. Several issues will increase the complexity of land 
acquisition. For example, the lack of reliable land record systems, and the inability of people losing land to either 
document ownership or be physically present to make their claims for eligibility. Such situations can increase due to 
the situation of forced displacement in the North East as well as the weakened local authorities who can mediate in 
land ownership conflicts Site- specific Resettlement Plans will, therefore, include procedures for identifying eligible 
project-affected people, calculating and delivering compensation, and mechanisms for land dispute grievance redress.

Corporate Review Decision Following the corporate review, the decision was taken to 
proceed with the preparation of the operation. 

 

I. Key development issues and rationale for Bank involvement  
 
1. Benin is one of the world’s least-developed countries, with an annual per capita income of 
approximately US$830 in 2017. Poverty remains widespread, with a poverty rate estimated at about 48 
percent ($1.90 a day poverty line – 2011 PPP) in 2017.  With an average per capita GDP growth rate of 1.3 
percent (2005-2015) driven primarily by the services sector, poverty reduction has been limited, 
highlighting the need to ensure a broad-based and stronger growth. There are significant regional 
disparities in poverty rates and rural poverty rates are higher than those in urban areas. Fewer female-
headed households fall below the national poverty line than male-headed households.  
 
2. The country’s economic performance has been hampered by low competitiveness and high 
informality.  Following the temporary slowdown experienced in 2015, economy activity rebounded driven 
by the recovery of private consumption and supported by increased cotton production, strong activity at 
the Port of Cotonou, and rising telecommunications and transport sector activity. However, economic 
performance in Benin remains hampered by a weak business enabling environment. The high cost and 
unpredictable supply of electricity is a key constraint for private sector development. Agriculture’s export 
is concentrated in the cotton sector, and agriculture suffers from supply chain deficiencies, including in 
the provision and distribution of inputs as well as on the marketing side. Approximately 90 percent of the 
labor force is engaged in the informal sector – agriculture, informal commerce and other services 
activities. 
 
3. The first pillar of the Fiscal Reform and Growth series on fiscal consolidation is justified given the 
Government’s effort to create fiscal space and improve the efficiency of public spending. In the run-up 
to 2016 Presidential elections, increases in the wage bill and out-of-budget expenses led to significant 
increases in public debt (up by almost 20 percent of GDP) and in the fiscal deficit (up from 2.1 percent of 
GDP in 2014 to 8 percent in 2015). The Government contained expenditures in 2016 to face the drop of

tax revenues and managed to reduce the fiscal deficit from 8 percent of GDP in 2015 to 6 percent of GDP 
in 2016.  In 2017, several measures were implemented to boost domestic revenues and reduce primary 
current spending and the fiscal deficit remained stable despite a surge in public investment spending. The 
DPO series supports the authorities’ effort to create fiscal space by improving revenue collection and 
managing more efficiently public expenditure, with an emphasis on wages and transfers.  In addition to 
the DPOs, the Government program is supported by an ECF program with the IMF approved by the IMF 
Board on April 7, 2017, providing macroeconomic and fiscal anchors that will support the implementation 
of the reforms. The first review of the Program, carried out in September 2017, confirmed that the 
authorities are committed to responsible fiscal management. This was also confirmed (at the staff level) 
by the preliminary results of the second review of the Program, which is currently under way. 

 
4. The second pillar aims at promoting agricultural productivity and strengthening the power sector 
which is a Government’s priority to create productive formal jobs and support inclusive growth. 
Agriculture employs over 50 percent of the population and is the economy’s leading formal sector foreign 
exchange earner. The country has a large endowment of arable and fertile land and adequate water 
resources. However, Benin’s comparative advantage in agriculture remains largely unexploited as the 
governance structure and relatively low food-safety standards had a negative impact on the sector’s 
competitiveness. Also, the inconsistent supply of electricity is frequently noted as a leading constraint to 
private sector growth, particularly in the light manufacturing and agricultural processing sectors. 
Strengthening the financial viability of the power sector and promote private sector participation is 
essential to increase electricity production capacity in a sustainable way. Focusing on these important real 
sectors will help improve productivity, create higher paying jobs and livelihoods, and enhance the 
country’s effort to reach the World Bank’s twin goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity. 
 
5. The third pillar supports the Government’s efforts to improve the delivery of social services, 
both in terms of equity and quality.  Although Benin has recorded some progress in terms of access to 
education and health services over the past decade, significant variations persist depending on the income 
groups and locations. The reforms supported in this pillar will help addressing this issue. In addition, the 
recent SCD, and other studies, has identified that one major constraint in the delivery of better social 
services lies in the excessive concentration of responsibilities at the central level.  The Government has 
launched a series of initiatives aimed at increasing the role of local government and communities and at 
improving the allocation of public resources across regions. The proposed operation will support these 
initiatives. 
 

II. Proposed Objective(s) 
 
5. The overarching goal of the proposed FRGC series is to boost real economic growth, reduce poverty 
and increase opportunities for the poorest in the population. The program development objectives of 
this FRGC series are to: a) support macroeconomic stability by strengthening fiscal management; b) 
promote economic growth by increasing the productivity and competitiveness of the agricultural sector 
and strengthening the power sector’s financial viability and production capacity; and c) improve social 
service delivery.  
 

III. Preliminary Description 
 
6. The first pillar of the DPO series will focus on supporting macroeconomic stability by strengthening 
fiscal management. Not only is adequacy of the macroeconomic and fiscal framework a prerequisite for 
sustainable economic growth but budgetary and debt sustainability is necessary to the delivery of 



effective public services that maximize the impact of available revenues on beneficiaries, including the 
poorest segments of the populations. In addition, increasing fiscal space will help relax fiscal constraints 
to accommodate the financing of needed infrastructure projects.  
 
7. The second pillar will seek to promote economic growth by increasing the productivity of the 
agricultural sector and strengthening the power sector’s financial viability and production capacity. This 
series focuses on measures aimed at increasing the productivity of the agricultural sector by supporting a 
policy, regulatory, and institutional framework that strengthens agriculture value chains and enhances 
diversification, promotes higher quality standards for agricultural products and supports greater access 
to credit in the primary sector. Moreover, the measures supported by the operation strengthen the 
financial viability of the power sector that is necessary to attract private sector participation and, thus, 
increase electricity production capacity, including in renewables, and access to electricity in a sustainable 
way. 
 
8. The third pillar contributes to addressing the key constraints to a more sustainable, efficient 
and equitable allocation of resources to build and maintain the human capital of Beninese adults and 
children. The measures supported under this pillar address two main issues: (i) the geographically uneven 
deployment of qualified primary teachers and health workers, and (ii) the limited and unpredictable 
resources allocated by the central government to communities to finance non-salary inputs and 
investments necessary to maintain quality service delivery. In particular, the proposed pillar supports the 
Government’s efforts to deploy teachers and health workers to underserved communities and ensure 
that local governments receive a sufficient and regular flow of funds to meet priority social sector needs, 
particularly those for the poorest members of communities served.  
 

 

IV. Poverty and Social Impacts and Environment Aspects 
 
Poverty and Social Impacts 
 
9. The FRG series is expected to have a positive impact on poverty reduction through different 
channels. This impact has been strengthened by the inclusion of the third pillar on human capital 
development that could have both a direct and indirect influence on the level and distribution of poverty.  
 
10.  Prior Actions 1 to 3 support measures to create fiscal space and are expected to facilitate the 
delivery of essential public services and to contribute to a macroeconomic environment conducive to 
economic growth and private sector employment creation. A stable and predictable macroeconomic 
environment is necessary to limit uncertainty, to attract and sustain both domestic and foreign 
investment, to grow the formal economy and to generate increasingly productive employment 
opportunities. Furthermore, the creation of fiscal space allows for an increased allocation of fiscal 
resources to the delivery of essential social services, a direct contribution to poverty reduction and 
improved quality of life. Increased fiscal space also allows for implementation of the Government’s public 
investment plans, which is conducive to the crowding-in of increased levels of private investment. As 
noted, the failure of growth to lead to poverty reduction in Benin largely reflects the highly informal 
nature of the economy and the lack of high productivity, high wage and secure employment opportunities. 
Fiscal and debt sustainability, and the macroeconomic certainty it engenders, along with better 
infrastructure and improved delivery of essential services will encourage and foster economic growth that 
is more formal in nature and thus more effective in reducing poverty.  
 



11. Prior Action 2 provides a potential exception, as the recommendations of the tax expenditure 
analysis have not been finalized yet and could entail removing exemptions that benefit the poor. 
Eighteen percent of taxes expenditure on VAT are related to basic foods; removing these exemptions 
could possibly have negative distributional impact on the poor. However, this scenario is unlikely given 
that tax exemptions on basic foods are regulated by a regional policy. In case some recommendations of 
the tax expenditure analysis suggest removing exemptions that potentially benefit the poor, a 
distributional impact analysis will be carried out to inform the Poverty and Social Impact Assessment 
(PSIA).  
 
12. Prior action 4, 5, and 6 focus on increasing agricultural productivity and competitiveness and 
contribute to the Government’s poverty reduction goals. In 2015, 60 percent of the rural population lived 
below the US$1.90 per day poverty line. As the rural population share is greater than the urban share, 65 
percent of the poor reside in rural areas. As noted previously, limited agricultural growth (around 3.5 
percent per year, which is approximately the rate of population growth in the country) has contributed to 
overall growth, but the impact on poverty reduction has been limited. Diversifying production into more 
valuable crops, and raising productivity should boost incomes among those involved in agriculture. 
 
13. Prior actions supported in the power sector pillar promote reliable access to electricity and a 
more cost-effective electricity provision and should have a direct and positive impact on the poor. As 
discussed above, only 29 percent of Benin’s households have access to electricity, and due to the 
significant disparities between urban and rural areas, only 6 percent of the rural population has access to 
electricity. The measures supported under this series will support the financial viability of the power 
sector which is a necessary condition to attract private investments, increase power production, improve 
power transmission and distribution, and ultimately improve access to electricity in Benin. Increased 
access to electricity is strongly correlated with improved education and health outcomes and associated 
increases in human capital and earning potential. Furthermore, access to electricity liberates non-paid 
family time demands, particularly for women and girls, and further increases quality of life and 
opportunities for investment in human capital, including in girls and women. Increased and more reliable 
access at affordable prices should also have a significant impact on firm creation, firm growth and 
resultant employment opportunities, particularly in the higher productivity formal sector. 
 
14. A full-fledged PSIA has been carried out to assess the potential impact of electricity pricing 
reforms in Benin. The PSIA concluded that improving the financial situation of the SBEE and thus reducing 
the gap between SBEE’s service unit cost and revenues per kWh are prerequisites for the expansion of 
SBEE operations throughout the country and greater access for poor households to electricity. The PSIA 
study also concluded that the current social policy of subsidizing the tariff for the poor is not effective and 
suggested some possible options to strengthen the policy including adopting a tariff policy based on usage 
and eliminating fixed costs for small customers. 

 
15. Prior action 9 provides measures to improve education service delivery is expected to have 
indirect positive effects on poverty reduction. Schools quality play a determinant role in education 
outcomes. The 2017 SCD concluded that low human capital contributes to income inequality, undermines 
long term economic growth and the prospects of the poor to realize shared prosperity. Improving school 
quality (through the pupil to teacher ratio) is likely to improve learning outcomes and increases grade 
attainment. As education outcomes improve for the poor, their will have better job opportunities that 
offer higher earnings and security.  

 



16. Prior action 10 supports the improvement of health services in rural areas through the 
recruitment of new health workers. Providing affordable health care service to the poor remains a 
challenge in Benin particularly in the rural areas.  Addressing health care needs of the poor requires a 
multidimensional strategy integrating availability of health services, their quality, geographic and financial 
accessibility. While the provision of new health workers will improve availability of health services in rural 
areas, we do not expect this measure alone to improve significantly health outcomes for the poor. 
 
17. Prior action 11 aims at strengthening social safety net programs through the promotion cash 
transfer which is expected to have substantial positive impact on poverty reduction in the short term. 
There is a body of evidence around the world that well-designed cash transfers program substantially 
improves lives of the poor including higher levels of asset holdings, consumption, food security, 
employment, income and saving. However recent studies show the impacts of conditional or 
unconditional cash transfers on living standard are transitory and fade away in the long run.   
 
Environment Aspects  
 
13. The policies supported by the proposed DPF are not likely to have negative impacts on the country’s 
natural assets. All the actions supported throughout the first operation are policy-oriented; they do not 
support environmentally impactful investments or involve policy actions with significant environmental 
consequences.  The measures supporting domestic resource mobilization and efficient management of 
public expenditure pose no risk to the environment. Measures designed to strengthen economic 
competitiveness are also largely environmentally neutral.  
 
14. Strengthening the financial viability of the power sector will support increased access to electricity 
and is expected to have a positive environmental impact. Households in Benin, particularly rural 
households, are highly dependent on biomass for their daily energy requirements. The reform program 
supported under the energy sector is likely to have positive environmental impacts and would help in the 
reduction of greenhouse gases occasioned by the predominance of fuel biomass (fuelwood, charcoal and 
plant wastes). Strengthening the financial viability of the power sector is likely to produce climate change 
mitigation co-benefit, since strengthening the financial viability of the sector is likely to promote the 
development of new energy efficient production capacities.  In the agricultural sector, measures intended 
to diversify agriculture away from a reliance on cotton could have a potentially positive environmental 
effect as agriculture becomes less mono-culture based and increasingly diversified. 
 
15. Over the last 20 years, the Government has made significant strides in mainstreaming 
environmental sustainability in projects. EIA is a legal requirement and it is widely applied to all 
developmental projects.  Environmental assessment is a necessary condition to obtain the approval to 
implement any development project. It has been set up in the Law N° 98-30 relating to the environmental 
framework and in the Decree N° 2001-235 relating to the environmental assessment procedures. The 
national environmental protection agency (ABE) has the capacity to implement, monitor, and report on 
mitigating measures and/or environmental and social management plans; and have been working in 
direct collaborations with the environmental and social specialists of the Bank funded projects.

I. Introduction and Context
Country Context
Although poverty rates in Kenya seem to have fallen, formidable challenges at reducing poverty, in 
particular in rural areas, remain.  Kenya’s poverty reduction from 47 percent in 2005/6 to about 39 
percent based on best estimates in 2012/13 , has been driven by solid growth across most of the 
economy, but improvements in income are not evenly shared amongst people but also amongst 
regions and inequality appears to be rising .  The scale of consumption poverty in Kenya is 
staggering, and is concentrated in rural areas.  Based on the last national household budget survey, 
close to half of the population (nearly 17 million Kenyans) was poor in 2005, the vast majority of 
the poor lived in rural areas, and were more likely to depend on income and consumption from 
crops and livestock, as a source of livelihood. Revised poverty estimates indicate that nearly 4 in 10 
Kenyans continue to live in extreme poverty. Poverty levels are highest in arid and semi-arid areas,

with roughly 70 percent the population living in the “small share” (about 12 percent) of the more 
agriculturally productive regions of the country (source: CPS FY2014-18). Tackling poverty must 
address the difficulties of low-income rural communities as well as the distinct problems of urban 
poverty that also encompass secondary cities.  
 
Income inequality levels are not likely to have decreased in recent years, and achieving inclusive 
growth remains Kenya’s key development objective. Kenya’s Gini coefficient of 47.7 is above that 
of neighboring comparators, including Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Uganda. The richest 10 percent of 
the population garner 40 percent of the nation’s income, whereas the poorest 10 percent receive 
only 2 percent of national income. While fostering income growth of the bottom 40 is not currently 
a target set explicitly by the national authorities, in practice it is currently equivalent to fostering 
income growth of the extreme poor. Significant investment and economic reform must be part of the 
effort to cut the poverty rate by 2 percentage points each year from now to 2030 if extreme poverty 
is to be ended in that timeframe (source: CPS, FY2014-18).

Sectoral and Institutional Context
Agriculture is the mainstay of Kenya’s economy, but is not reaching its potential to fully contribute 
to poverty reduction and shared prosperity. The sector directly accounts for 25 percent of GDP, and 
provides 62 percent of formal employment, and 45 percent of government revenue.  However, 
although specific high-value sub-sectors like horticulture and tea have performed well, small-scale 
agriculture – the main livelihood for most of Kenya’s poor – has performed very poorly.  Despite 
demographic changes and urbanization, the majority of the rural population still derives their 
livelihoods from agricultural and related activities, at low levels of productivity. There is therefore a 
very strong linkage between agriculture and the overall performance of the economy as well as the 
wellbeing of the Kenyans (both rural and urban). 
 
Vulnerable groups in rural areas bear the highest incidence of poverty depending on how well they 
have been prepositioned to face shocks.  Social exclusion creates vulnerability particularly among 
women and youth.  Lack of stable income, secure shelter, isolation from markets, jobs scarcity, lack 
of access to information and technologies and knowledge, education etc. all act as drivers to social 
exclusion and lack of prosperity that is being experienced by rural families. In agriculture, women 
comprise more than 70 percent of the labor force, yet they own only 1-5 percent of agricultural land 
titles. In terms of non-agricultural employment, only 29 percent of those earning a formal wage are 
women and female youths are twice as likely to be unemployed as adult females. 
 
Management of natural resources and water catchments is critical to the well-being of the most 
vulnerable and to improving prosperity of rural communities. Kenya's growth prospects and main 
economic activities, especially agriculture, hydro-power generation and water supply are strongly 
linked to the country's environment and natural resource base.  However, such catchment areas in 
Kenya have undergone intensive environmental degradation resulting in the siltation of rivers, 
reservoirs and irrigation canals, which in turn exacerbates flooding and vulnerability.  Kenya 
already is one of the most degraded areas in the region with about 70 percent of the population 
living in the 12 percent of total land area that is classified as being of medium to high potential for 
agriculture and livestock production. Further, Kenya is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate 
change. Many of the economic activities and livelihoods rely on natural resources will be impacted 
by climate change related occurences, such erratic weather patterns, floods and droughts. Proper 
management and conservation of key catchment areas, as well as actions to respond to climate 
change (such as the adoption of climate-smart agriculture practices, or strengthening the adaptive

capacity of communities through improved access to information and services) are key strategic 
requirements for increasing for increasing agricultural productivity, poverty reduction and economic 
growth. 
   
The 2010 Constitution gives hope in addressing some of the exclusion witnessed in the past.  
Devolution to 47 Counties paves way for a more equal distribution of resources and better service 
delivery. The Constitution Bill of Rights emphasizes the need to protect the vulnerable and 
marginalized members of Kenyan communities. Much needs to be done in practice to ensure that it 
rectifies the unequal distribution of investments and services and does not instead cause service 
delivery to deteriorate. The Constitution also recognizes improved governance, transparency and 
citizen participation as essential to realize Kenyan aspirations.  
 
The Constitution and the Government’s ambitious devolution process bring major new 
opportunities, as well as near-term challenges, for enhancing poverty reduction, citizen 
participation, agricultural productivity, as well as governance. Counties now play the primary on-
the-ground role in delivering agriculture services that previously were managed by the national 
government.  Key functions related to these services were transferred to the Counties in August 
2013, and the “Equitable Share” includes significant resources that had formerly been allocated to 
national ministries to carry out these services, with national government retaining a policy making 
role. There is a major need, and window of opportunity, to support Counties to put in place 
institutional structures, mechanisms and staffing to deliver on their mandates. Many Counties are 
looking for mechanisms, such as community-led development programs, that can help to mobilize 
their citizens to take an active role in delivery of services.  
 
Kenya has significant experience supporting community-led development, agriculture and citizen-
centered governance, specifically gained from the Western Kenya Community-Driven Development 
and Flood Mitigation (WKCDD/FM) Project and the Kenya Agricultural Productivity and 
Agribusiness Project (KAPAP) .  Both projects are delivering on their development objectives and 
have demonstrated new approaches to mobilizing communities and small-scale agriculturalists, 
while facing implementation and governance challenges that have afflicted multiple projects in the 
Bank’s Kenya portfolio. These types of operations have demonstrated results in mobilizing poor 
communities to undertake initiatives that improve local livelihoods, and have progressively sought 
to incorporate lessons learned from similar community-led initiatives in South Asia and other 
regions. Experience thus far suggests that unlike top-down approaches, effective community-level 
planning and execution encourages innovative development solutions that reflect local priorities.   
 
Rural transformation in an inclusive and sustainable manner is the long-term vision of the 
Government of Kenya (GoK).  To achieve this inclusive transformation, a series of multi-sector 
programs will be required over the next 5 to 15 years. The Bank, in response to the GoK’s request to 
scale up community-led and market-driven approaches in the agricultural sector as the first program 
in the series, proposes a Kenya National Agricultural and Rural Inclusive Growth Project (P153349) 
to be implemented over five years with an approximate IDA envelope of US$200 million.

Relationship to CAS
The Government, as well as the World Bank’s new Kenya Country Partnership Strategy (CPS/
FY2014-18), places a strong priority on supporting agriculture and the devolution process to 
enhance poverty reduction and shared prosperity. Enhancing the role of agriculture in generating 
shared prosperity and poverty reduction, as well as in supporting national and County governments

to provide effective decentralized service delivery are key priorities.  The agricultural sector is 
identified as one of the key sectors of the economic pillar in the “Kenya Vision 2030” which is 
operationalized by the Second Medium Term Plan (2013-2017), as well as other key policies such 
as the Agriculture Sector Development Policy aiming to achieve 5 – 7 percent annual agriculture 
sector growth. The CPS identifies agriculture as the sector with the most potential to make a 
significant difference to Kenya’s rural poor, including women, who make up 70 percent of the rural 
labor force; and to deliver on national objectives for shared prosperity.   
 
Alignment with Country Partnership Strategy. The proposed program is fully aligned with the focus 
areas of the CPS and will contribute to its objectives through the Bank’s three key domains of 
engagement in Kenya.  First, under Domain 1 – “Competitiveness and sustainability: growth to 
eradicate poverty”, the proposed project would help achieve the high level objective of improving 
agriculture productivity and sustainability . Second, the proposed project would directly contribute 
to Domain 2 – “Protection and potential: delivering shared prosperity”, where the focus is to protect 
the vulnerable and help them develop their potential. The CPS recognizes that agriculture is one of 
the high priority areas interventions to target support for the poor that directly links with helping 
farmers in rural areas. Engaging communities and supporting especially women and youth are also 
recognized to be important. Third, the proposed project would also assist in achieving the two high 
level objectives of operationalizing the devolution framework for local decision making and smooth 
delivery of decentralized services under Domain 3 – “Consistency and equity: delivering a 
devolution dividend”.

II. Proposed Development Objective(s)
Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
The proposed development objective is to reduce vulnerabilities and promote inclusive agricultural 
and other livelihoods of the small-scale and marginal farmers in the targeted communities.

Key Results (From PCN)
Achievement of the PDO and key results are proposed to be measured by the following  indicators: 
(a) Direct project beneficiaries (number) of which female (percentage)- this core indicator will 
essentially measure the number of vulnerable and poor/small and marginal farmers (bottom 40 
percent, disaggregated by gender) benefitting from project interventions both in terms of 
infrastructure and livelihoods; (b) Communities and Counties, through their own institutions, 
implementing, operating, and managing their development activities (number); and (c) Increase of 
household incomes and assets of small and marginal farmers (less than 2 acres) (percentage).  A 
detailed results monitoring framework and indicators will be developed during the project 
preparation.

III. Preliminary Description
Concept Description
Project Approach and Scope: To promote inclusive and sustainable agricultural and livelihood 
development, the proposed project interventions will use a three-pronged approach along the key 
guiding principles of: participation, inclusion, poverty targeting, transparency, accountability, value-
for-money, and self-help. First, to address key aspects of rural development that cut across cultural, 
ecological, and socioeconomic areas , the project design will use a holistic, integrated landscape 
approach that looks at all resources (natural capital (land, water, and other natural resources), 
physical capital (infrastructure, etc.) and social capital (communities, institutions, etc.) to develop

strong horizontal and vertical collaboration with stakeholders to managing competing demands. 
Second, to effectively identify and address distinct local needs, the project will use a community-led 
approach that has been successfully providing services to rural populations in Kenya. Participation 
of the beneficiary population and County governments in all stages of the process would be 
essential for ensuring ownership and sustainability of the investments. Third, the project will adopt 
a market-driven approach to ensure that agricultural development and livelihood promotion are 
linked to markets/private sector thereby contributing to increased economic transformation and 
improved livelihoods of the target population. With focused support, a sizeable group of small 
farmers and other vulnerable groups can be a source of much needed employment and growth in the 
rural areas. The project will also place a strong emphasis on sustainability – how to build and 
sustain community-led institutions and farmer-led market associations that can raise adequate 
revenues to sustain and expand operations, and are incentivized to deliver tangible benefits for poor 
and vulnerable populations.  
 
Project Area.  Selection of the proposed project area will be defined during preparation recognizing 
that some degree of geographical concentration will be needed in order to provide widely shared 
benefits.  Roughly, the project will cover about 10 to 15 counties, benefitting about 500,000 farm-
families, about 2. 5 million population . Selection of the project area will be in done following an 
overall holistic/landscape approach, ensuring close collaboration and coordination with proposed 
IDA-supported rural roads, rural energy and devolution projects currently under preparation. The 
selection criteria could include: (i) agricultural and livestock potential areas; (ii) number of poor 
people living in rural areas; (iii) human development indicators such as malnutrition, food 
insecurity, sanitation coverage, etc.; (iv) willingness of County governments and communities to 
commit to the program’s objectives/principles and provide cash/labore or in-kind support, and; (v) 
clustering approach – in terms of both physical/biological clustering as in case of watershed, and 
economic clustering.  
 
Project Components: The project will comprise 4 components:  
 
Component 1: Support to Farmer/Community Institutions and Agricultural/Rural Livelihoods 
(roughly US$100 million of IDA Credit): This component will provide support and resources to 
communities for building and strengthening their institutions (farmer/producer groups, cooperatives, 
etc), improving agriculture and rural livelihoods (extension, technology, irrigation, natural resource 
management, finance, etc), reducing vulnerabilities such as unemployment (especially youth), 
disability, food insecurity and malnutrition, and improving quality of life (small access roads/
bridges, water, etc). This component could provide support through two windows aimed at: (a) 
providing financing for public goods, and; (b) promoting agricultural and rural livelihoods as 
private goods. The funds will be released directly to the communities in tranches based on their 
performance, and will be managed at the community level. Investments would need to be made in 
land rehabilitation and land conservation measures also to arrest erosion-induced declining land 
productivity, and connecting the farmers as well as community to roads and markets.   
 
Component 2: Strengthening Inter-community/Producer Cooperatives and Investments for 
Agricultural Value Chains (roughly US$60 million of IDA Credit): This component will support the 
strengthening of higher level farmer institutions (cooperatives, producer federations, natural 
resource users associations, etc) that help farmers and communities work together to improve 
productivity and value-addition, and to achieve efficiency and economies of scale of local activities. 
The component will also support activities that require cooperation within and across multiple

communities. Key activities proposed under this component include: (i) strengthening producer 
federations and cooperatives; (ii) developing value-chains and commercial agriculture; (iii) 
improving catchment management practices; (iv) promoting innovative technology, farming 
methods, and good agricultural practices that help target beneficiaries to improve efficiency and 
quality of their production; and (v) complementing existing subsistence strategies that promote 
climate resilience with new measures such as efficient irrigation, new crop varieties (e.g., drought 
and disease tolerant, quicker-growing), and erosion controls. These climate smart techniques and 
dissemination of climate information (e.g., seasonal forecasts and long-term trends) can address 
more intense rainfall events and water conservation measures. Component 2 will build synergies 
with other initiatives at the national level and in the project area such as feeder roads development, 
rural electrification and devolution, etc., in order to have a multiplier effect on achieving sustainable 
results.   
 
Component 3: Building Capacity of County Governments and Other Partners to Support 
Community-Led Development (roughly US$30 million of IDA Credit): This component will 
support County governments and other partners (including communities) to strengthen their roles 
and capacity as enablers of community-led initiatives for farmers and vulnerable populations. 
Proposed activities to be supported will include: (i) integrating community-led initiatives in County 
Integrated Development Planning and Budgeting processes; (ii) building County capacity including 
policies, staff, processes/systems, and monitoring; (iii) identifying and monitoring progress and 
needs of poor and marginalized communities, and; (iv) developing platforms to share information 
on ongoing initiatives, identifying and disseminating good practices, and enhancing coordination 
among different actors.   
 
Component 4: Coordination, Facilitation and Monitoring (roughly US$10 million of IDA Credit): 
This component will support overall national level coordination, facilitation, management, technical 
support, and monitoring, learning and evaluation.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 

Following its independence, Côte d’Ivoire occupied a unique place in Africa. For two decades, the country experienced political stability, high 

growth and sustained poverty reduction.  Ample natural resources and favorable terms of trade for its main agricultural exports helped the 

country achieve a strong economic performance which, by the end of the 1970s made Côte d’Ivoire the major player of the West African 

Monetary and Economic Union. By 1980 the country was the world's leading exporter of cocoa and Africa's leading exporter of pineapples, 

palm oil, rubber and bananas. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew steadily during that period at average 6 percent per year. The surpluses 

generated by agriculture alone have enabled the country to have a relatively large industry, whose contribution to GDP reached 23 percent in 

1982. It is also principally due to agriculture that Ivoirians enjoyed the highest annual per capita income in the West African sub-region, 

including Nigeria. A sharp reversal began in 1980 as terms of trade deteriorated precipitously and the CFAF became increasingly overvalued. 

From 1981 to 1992, annual GDP growth averaged -0.2 percent and Côte d’Ivoire slipped from the rank of middle income countries into the low

income group. The devaluation of the CFAF in 1994 triggered an economic rebound, but this was soon undermined by the political crisis which 

began in 1999
1
. During this period which lasted until 2011, the increase in the depth and severity of poverty was dramatic all over the country. 

Côte d’Ivoire’s economic performance over the past four years has been impressive. Renewed political stability, concurrently with structural 

reforms

 to improve the business climate

3
 and supportive fiscal policy enabled a strong pickup in economic activity. Over the last 4 years, 

economic activity expanded by 9 percent a year on average translating, into an increase in real per capita income of more than 20 percent. In 

2015, real GDP grew by 8.6 percent driven by strong investment and private consumption. Inflation remained subdued, reflecting ample 

domestic food production and imported consumer products. In response to the rebound of economic growth, the poverty incidence in the 
country slightly diminished from an estimated 51 percent in 2011 to 46 percent in 2015

4
, but other human development indicators have been 

slow to improve. Efforts were made during the period 2012–15 to make growth more inclusive by increasing the farm price for coffee and 

cocoa and other agriculture products and improving basic infrastructure in rural areas. Nevertheless, the country is still facing several 

challenges, including significant disparities across the country in terms of education attainment, heath services, employment, and income.  

Challenges ahead – poverty and inequality. Poverty continues to be overwhelmingly rural with disparities in access to basic services, and 

gender disparities across wealth and urban-rural groups. People living below the poverty line tend to be unemployed and are from large 

households, the agricultural sector, and weak educational background. Poverty is also found to be more common among the young: 51.4 

percent of Ivoirians younger than 25 years are classified as poor, while poverty rates in other age groups vary from 35 to 39 percent. The 

recently concluded Bank Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) shows that poverty is significantly concentrated in rural areas and in the 

Northern parts of the country (where the potential for agriculture has not yet been realized), while greater Abidjan is becoming ever more 

dominant in the country’s economy. Poverty rates are 69 percent in North versus 25 percent in the South (within the southern regions, poverty 

rates tend to increase from East to West). While spatial inequality worsened during most of the crisis period, the rural-urban divide continued 

to grow even during the recent recovery. Such unbalanced - mostly Abidjan centric - development is unsustainable; both economically, because 

it relies on too few sectoral and regional drivers and socially, because it does not tackle the roots of fragility in the cou ntry. The 2015 Human 

Development Report ranked Côte d’Ivoire at 172 out of 188 countries (far below neighboring Ghana in 140
th

 place), with an overall Human 

Development Index below the average for sub-Saharan Africa. 

Côte d’Ivoire ambitious development agenda - making the country an emerging market economy. Following last October’s peaceful 

presidential elections, political uncertainties have diminished, paving the way for continued economic progress. The medium-term outlook is 

favorable. Economic activity is projected to remain strong at 8.5 percent in 2016, and 7.4 percent per year on average in 2017–20. The 

Government has recently adopted a new 2016–20 National Development Plan (NDP)
5
 aimed at achieving strong and inclusive growth - halving 

poverty and fostering structural transformation. To support the structural transformation foreseen under the NDP, the Government intends to 

pursue further reforms to improve the business climate and strengthen the private sector contribution in the economy, including in the form of 

a public-private partnership. This will involve creating new opportunities for diversification based on the country’s comparative advantages and 

fostering sustainable integration into regional and global value chains. A greater impetus will be given to stimulating industrial production - 

moving to higher domestic value-added products through the local transformation of a larger share of agricultural products (especially cocoa 

and cashew). The Government has set a target of at least fifty percent of cacao beans domestically processed and eventually more for cashew 

nuts by 2020. In attaining this targeted, the Government is also seeking to increase the participation of nationally domiciled entities in cacao 

and cashew processing, and is assessing options regarding policies that could encourage growth of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) 

in both sectors. Successful NDP implementation will depend on the pace at which the main structural barriers are removed and productivity-

enhancing reforms are carried out, as well as on financing conditions and how domestic and external risks are addressed.  The authorities have 

expressed an interest in a new Fund arrangement to support the NDP objectives, including the IBRD-Enclave financing mechanism.

 Between 1985 and 2008, the estimated share of the population living below the poverty line increased from around 10 percent to about 49 percent.

 The Government has undertaken a number of important economic reforms and reached the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries completion point in June 2012.

 According to the World Bank “Doing Business Index”, Cote d’Ivoire has gained some 25 places in the world ranking, from 2011 to 2016 and ranked among the 10 best 

reformers in 2014 and 2015. Côte d’Ivoire was also ranked among the fastest improving countries on Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index, rising 
from 154

 The NDP is based on four strategic pillars: (i) enhancing the quality of institutions and governance; (ii) stepping-up the development of human capital and promoting 

social well-being; (iii) speeding up structural transformation and industrialization; and (iv) strengthening the infrastructure base while preserving the environment.

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

Cote d’Ivoire’s economy and growth have been driven by commodity-based exports and this will remain the key in the medium-term. The 

most important export crops – cocoa, rubber, palm oil, cotton and cashew – are also the main sources for smallholders’ income as well as the 

center-piece of the country’s major farming systems. Cocoa, rubber and oil palm are at the center of the forest zone’s diversified production 

mix with smallholders generally maintaining a wide variety of cash and food crops (rice, cassava, plantain). Cotton and cashew are the main 

cash crops and drivers of the savanna economy and farming systems (which include maize, rice and livestock), where cotton in particular has 

important spill-over effects on food crop productivity through the use of improved technology.  

The agricultural sector currently accounts for 22 percent of GDP, over three-quarters of non-oil exports, and provides employment and 

income to two-thirds of all households. Côte d’Ivoire is the world’s largest producer of cacao and has become the largest producer and 

exporter of raw cashew nuts (RCN). The country remains also the largest exporter of rubber, oil palm, bananas, pineapples and copra in Africa 

and is self-sufficient in a variety of staple foods – maize, sorghum, millet, yam, cassava, plantain banana – with some small exports to the sub-

region. The impact of production of export commodities extend to several other sectors through forward and backward linkages - inputs, 

processing, transport, financial services, taxes, energy and final consumption and therefore play a key role in the country for the creation of job 

opportunities and poverty reduction. In fact, the domestic trade and transport industry (trucking and port) depends to a large extend on 

agriculture for its business. Similarly, agro-processing industries such as cotton ginneries, rubber, palm oil and sugar factories provide the base 

for rural industry, while an important component of urban industry is made up of cocoa processing plants, textile cottonseed oil operations, 

packaging materials, second stage transformation of oil palm into soaps, cosmetics, etc.  

While significant results have been achieved in improving the agriculture sector’s performance in recent years, it is facing several constraints 

that negatively impact its sustainable development. These include a range of technical and circumstantial issues, such as limited access to 

inputs; weak extension services; considerable post-harvest handling, transportation and storage losses; inadequate exposure to modern 

farming techniques, and aging and poor maintenance of existing plantations. These limitations are compounded by structural economic factors, 

such as access to finance (in particular for SMEs), deteriorating physical infrastructure, and limited public goods, all of which have contributed 

to the long-term stagnation of productivity and low value addition. Tackling these constraints can unleash the agricultural sector potential and 

increase its participation into global value chains involving many agro-food items and agro-industries in high demand regionally and/or 

worldwide - attracting major investments which can stimulate economic growth along with creating value, scaling-up innovation, and achieving 

the country’s overarching objective to ensure the population’s wellbeing by reducing poverty and inequality, through structural transformation 

of the economy. 

THE CASHEW SECTOR: COTE D’IVOIRE – AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ORIGIN FOR RCN AND PROCESSING. In 2015, Côte d’Ivoire became 

the world’s largest producer of RCN, with a production of 702,000 tons, or 21 percent of the world’s total production. The value of 2015 

cashew exports is estimated at over US$ 650 million, which makes cashew the third most important export commodity after cacao and refined 

petroleum products, but ahead of rubber, cotton and coffee
6
. The importance of cashew production is even more critical when viewed in a 

regional and poverty reduction context. It is grown by about 250,000 households (about 1.5 million persons) in the poorer, northern half of the 

country, where cashew has become the most important source of rural cash income. It is clearly an exciting source of growth with the added 

advantage of having the potential to generate better and inclusive rural employment through farming and rural industrialization. Provided that 

a comprehensive strategy addressing the Ivoirian cashew value chain competitiveness constraints is put in place, overall growth in the value of 

cashew exports by 15 percent p.a. over the next decade seems feasible
7
.  

However, the cashew value chain in Cote d’Ivoire faces several constraints hindering its development. Figure 1 below summarizes these 

constraints and their level of intensity. They concern: (i) the governance of the value-chain; (ii) the quality of the nuts that are heterogeneous in 

size and often of bad quality due to inadequate harvesting and post-harvesting methods; (iii) the high investment cost, including equipment 

and spare parts; (iv) the lack of technical and managerial skills and the low productivity of the labor force; (v) the difficulty in accessing credit, 

for both investments and working capital, and the high cost of this credit when available; (vi) the international buyers’ perceived risk of 

sourcing kernel supply from African processors; (vii) the investor’s perception of a relatively unfriendly sector policies and business 

environment; and (viii) the poorly developed rural infrastructure.

 Gross farmer receipts in 2015 are estimated at US$ 400 million (CFAF 250 billion), now way ahead of those of cotton (US$ 180 million), the traditional cash crop of 

the north. A comparison in terms of net farmer receipts would be even more favorable, since cotton involves much higher input costs (about 1/3 of gross receipts).

Fig. 1 Cashew value chain competitiveness main constraints in Cote d’Ivoire 

 

                             (Source: Adapted from Technoserve, 2010) 

 

The past expansion of Cote d’Ivoire cashew production has been extraordinary. Production has been growing by over 20 percent per annum 

over the last two decades (from 6000 tons in 1990 to 63,000 tons in 2000 to over 702,000 tons in 2015). However, this rapid increase in RCN 

production has been largely driven by an expansion in the planted area rather than by productivity gains. Although plantations are in general 

relatively young (66 percent less than 25 years old), they have been established with low-productivity planting material (unimproved tree 

varieties from home saved seeds) and farmers tend to apply virtually no inputs apart from family labor. Treatment for disease and insects is 

rare, harvesting practices leave much to be desired, and drying and storage are poorly done. As a result, productivity is low (300kg/ha) 

compared with other producers in South and South-East Asia (India 850kg/ha and Vietnam 1,000kg/ha) and Ivoirian cashew nuts suffer an 

average price discount of about 15 percent compared to the average price for African cashew exports to India. While this low intensity 

approach is well suited to low income, risk adverse decision making processes, there is clearly room for significant improvement in productivity 

as knowledge is shared and internal market linkages strengthen. In addition, low productivity at the production base increases aggregation 

costs over poor road networks. Low levels of pruning and tree maintenance increase harvesting time and negatively impact nut size and 

quality.  

Despite being a major producer of RCN, Cote d’Ivoire only processes around 5 to 7 percent of its production. The vast majority of RCN 

exported goes to India and Vietnam with 85 percent exported by foreign owned companies based in India, Singapore and Vietnam. The balance 

is traded by 10 domestic cooperatives/enterprises who in turn have pre-finance links with foreign companies
8
. While some competition 

between buyers may exist, there are also suspicions of anti-competitive practices, and this dependence on two countries could be a problem. 

The existing installed processing capacity of RCN in Cote d’Ivoire is estimated at 75,000Mt (with an actual use of only 50 percent). Moreover, 

nearly all processed cashew in 2015 came from two factories with a combined capacity of 42,000Mt. These numbers highlight not only the 

huge imbalance between RCN exports and processed quantities but, the socio-economic losses to the Ivorian economy. If only 50 percent of 

the harvest was processed locally, over 100,000 jobs could be created (of which at least 60 percent women), delivering more than $100 million 

                                            
8
 The dominance of foreign based companies is explained by the historical significance of India as a processor of RCN from origins worldwide. Foreign processors and 

trading companies are often multi-commodity and spread trading/market risk and overheads over a number of value chains. Larger companies have international 
credit lines that underwrite borrowing from local banks for working capital needs through the buying season. Companies trading into India have established links to 
large domestic consumer markets as well as developed trading relationships with roasters and retailers in the US and Europe.

in wage per years to the local economy and primarily in the impoverished north

. Other gains will be obtained for the country in the form of 

foreign exchange value of exports
10

 and the cashew shells could be processed into biofuel and used for electricity generation in rural areas.  

It is time to move from raw cashew exports to domestic processing. Clearly there are solid socio-economic reasons for expanding the 
processing sector in Cote d’Ivoire on a number of fronts, including a vibrant market and a strategic cashew supply chain context: (i) The high 

dependence on Vietnam (70 percent) is seen as a risk factor for international buyers of cashew kernels
11

. An alternative is needed accentuated 

by the loss of supply from India (exports falling as domestic consumption grows) and Brazil (falling production); (ii) the growing weight of Cote 

d’Ivoire in the overall supply of the market and its proximity from both the European and US markets, are focusing the attention of processors 

and end-users on Ivoirian producers; (iii) the possibility to create shorter, more traceable value chains, is a very powerful incentive for 

consumers to source their kernels directly in Cote d’Ivoire. Currently, kernels processed in India and Vietnam come from a variety of sources 

and reach the European and US markets indirectly, after a long and largely untraceable chain. Local processing means a significant cut in 

transport costs by eliminating the shipping of raw cashews to Asia for processing and shipping the kernels back to the European and US market. 

The more direct route, and the sourcing from a unique producer also permit to better meet the European market’s increasing emphasis on 

traceability from farm to fork. Downstream in the supply chain, food manufacturers and retailers are generally shortening their chains as well 

(in terms of supply networks and relations), thus operating increasingly with a limited number of preferred suppliers (importers and producers) 

to which they transfer the responsibility for traceability and product safety and quality
12

. In addition, shorter transportation lines diminish the 

carbon footprint of the cashew value chain, which is an interesting environmentally-friendly proposition and a definite competitive advantage 

of Ivoirian processors; and (iv) there is yet an untapped potential opportunity in organic cashew certified production. The current lack of use of 

chemical inputs would facilitate a fast transition to organic production and make Cote d’Ivoire unique in the World with premium product at 

lower cost.  Finally, in term of RCN production, future impact of climate change on crops such as cacao is expected to lead to a reduction of the 

areas suitable for cocoa which will then become suitable for cashews as it is drought and wind resistant. 

However, even with an abundance of raw material, levels of investment in processing have been very low and existing capacity 

underutilized. The debate about the competitiveness of the processing cashew in Cote d’Ivoire has evolved over the past 10 years. The broad 

conclusion drawn by sector experts is that processing locally could be competitive provided a number of key criteria are met. These include: 

selection and use of efficient semi-mechanized processing equipment, management by experienced and specialized staff and a well-trained, 

disciplined workforce. Studies also highlight potential competitive risks to a domestic processing sector in the form of high labor costs, lower 

productivity, access to and cost of capital, food safety and traceability standards, constantly evolving improvements in technology at processing 

centers of India and Vietnam driving competitive advantage and un-hedged risks in differentials between RCN and processed kernel prices
13

. 

Promoting domestic processing will therefore require implementing a comprehensive value-chain development approach with some 

incentives, carefully managed to avoid penalizing the farmers or protecting inefficient enterprises. If an export tax is used, its proceeds should 

be channeled into a program not only to promote domestic processing, but also to raise crop yields which are far below those of competing 

Asian countries. Public research and extension should be strengthened as well as the regulatory framework which is needed to improve 

coordination without hampering the dynamism of the private sector.  

THE CASHEW WORLD MARKET CONTEXT. The international global trade in both raw and processed cashew nuts has evolved greatly over the 

last 15 years.  Trade in processed nuts (kernels) has grown from around 234,000Mt in 2000 to over 680,000Mt in 2015. This represents an 

annual growth rate of 9.3 percent over the period. The main consumption markets are India, the USA and Europe that account for 75 percent 

of total consumption.  Demand is driven by a combination income-economic growth and dietary trends related to health and lifestyle. Global 

kernel demand is predicted to increase over the following decade, albeit at lower rates than the recent past. The US and European markets 

where cashew is essentially a snack food are price sensitive and are substituted with nuts such as almonds. Indian consumption is largely as a 

cooked food ingredient where broken nuts are widely used and increasingly as a festival related gifts. Demand in East Asia is predicted to 

remain strong as a growing middle class consumes higher value food products. Raw cashew nuts are produced in four main geographical 

regions: South East Asia, West Africa, East Africa and Brazil. World production reached an estimated 3.5 million Mt in 2015 with around 45 

percent originating in Asia, 45 percent in West Africa and the balance from East Africa and Brazil. Global RCN production is estimated to grow 

                                            
9
 Calculation based on 350,000 MT of RCN. It is estimated that RCN processing creates around one full time job per 3-4Mt of nuts processed.   

10
 The raw cashew nut accounts for 34 percent of the final product value, while shelling adds another 8 percent and roasting and salting an additional 16 percent. 

11
 Today Vietnam depends on imports for 70 percent of its needs of RCN. There is a highly risky chain where the US for example buys 70 percent of its needs from 

Vietnam which in turn buys 70 percent of its needs in West Africa. The US buyer depends on the West African farmer but has no influence in that market.   
12

 Although they don’t require full traceability, EU buyers expect suppliers to know and document their own buyers and suppliers (one step forward and one step back 
in the chain), which products are used during production process, and to label final products for traceability in case of a food safety problem. 
13

 Increasing quality and traceability demands are not being met by Vietnamese processors. There are multiple quality problems and food safety issues (especially 
foreign matter) and much confidence has been lost among buyers. In addition, labor conditions in Vietnamese factories constitute a risk for buyers.

to around 4.5 million Mt by the year 2020.  RCN production has been growing at an annual rate of around 5.7 percent per annum, noticeably 

slower than that for processed kernels.   

Future predictions of supply and demand suggest continued growth in both parameters.  However, two key factors are likely to impact 

significantly on Ivorian (and West African) growers and processors. Firstly, it is expected that demand for processed kernels will out-strip supply 

of RCN globally. This will continue to drive RCN prices higher with increased volatility as the gap widens. Secondly, production of RCN is either 

flat or declining in other origins with the result that Africa, and in particular Cote d’Ivoire, will become increasingly a dominant player in RCN 

production. West Africa RCN production is rising in response to higher prices internationally although will inevitably lag behind due to the four-

year establishment period of the crop.  

The international price for cashew kernels (quotes in USD/Lb) is a “spot price” derived through open market negotiations between buyers 

and sellers. There is no formally quoted futures market contract and there no derivative or proxy hedges available. International prices have 

been stable over extended periods but with two significant upward spikes in 2008 and 2011. The first spike was brought to an end due to the 

turmoil in financial markets worldwide and the second resulted from concern about RCN availability due to poor crops in east and west Africa. 

In 2011 prices peaked at over $4.00/Lb ($8,800 per Mt) only to fall back to the current range of $3.50-3.90/Lb or $7,700-8580 Mt for 

benchmark grade WW320. The international kernel price in processing countries is translated back to a farm gate RCN price at origin though a 

series of complex interactions. The current supply/demand situation appears to be driving up RCN prices to levels where highly efficient 

processors in India and Vietnam can make adequate profit margins. Processors at origin in West Africa operating at lower processing efficiency 

and poorly developed relationships with consuming markets, claim to be in negative gross margin territory when RCN prices reach 500 CFAF 

per kg (or $841 Mt).   

CASHEW SECTOR INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT. The Government of Cote d’Ivoire has recognized the potential for job creation and value addition 

through expansion of domestic cashew processing. It has included the development of the cashew sector, and cashew processing in particular, 

as a national priority in its NDP 2016-20 and its National Agricultural Investment Plan (NAIP). In 2013, the authorities has adopted a reform of 

the sector and the main lines of a strategy for the promotion of domestic cashew processing (prepared jointly by the Ministry of Industry and 

Mines, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Environment).  

The 2013 reform focuses on improving on-farm productivity, marketing of RCN and strengthening the management of the value chain. It 

includes the following main pillars: (i) The establishment of a public Agency “Council for Cotton and Cashew - CCA”
14

  in charge of coordinating 

and promoting the development of the cashew (and cotton) sector, by providing the necessary regulations of all activities in the sector, 

organizing the provision of  critical services, supporting the strengthening of producer associations and the creation of a strong 

Interprofessional body for the management of the value chain; (ii) Programs for strengthening research, the production and distribution of 

improved planting material, the improvement of advisory services for providing technical support to farmers on good agricultural practices and 

harvest/post-harvest methods to improve quality of RCN; (iii) The establishment of efficient quality control and traceability mechanisms; (iv) 

The establishment of a new producer price mechanism guaranteeing a farm-gate price of at least 60 percent of the CIF
15

 price of RCN; (v) The 

rationalization of domestic marketing through the establishment of a network of licensed warehouses; and (vi) The rehabilitation of rural roads 

in the main producing areas. Most of these activities are already under implementation, financed by the levies imposed on the value chain (and 

with the support of the IDA-financed PSAC
16

 and IFC). However, the implementation of these activities remain unfunded and should be 

accelerated to be able to respond to the Government’s objective of increasing the percentage of domestically processed RCN by 2020. 

Especially attention must also be paid to building the capacity of the CCA and improving the governance of producers’ organizations. There are 

many cooperatives and other village-level groups, but they are mainly focused on collecting the harvest. They offer few other services, have 

little knowledge of the market, and are generally poorly governed. There are also several federations of producers’ organizations but they do 

not do much better, so that producers’ interests are poorly represented in the inter-profession. A considerable effort will be needed to build a 

legitimate structure to support improved practices and to speak on behalf of farmers, starting with a census of sector. 

The Ministry of Industry and Mines is implementing a parallel set of reforms and policies aimed at developing the processing sector.  These 

include clarification of the regulatory framework, public infrastructure development, assistance in processing technology procurement and

 The CCA was created in 2013 to take over the functions of two previous bodies: The Autorité de Regulation du Coton et de l’Anacarde, created in 2002 as the sector 
regulatory body, and Intercajou, the value chain Interprofessional body responsible for the management and coordination of value chain private actors.  The CCA has 
the mission of developing the productivity of the entire value chain from production to the processing sector. It plays a regulatory role in the sector, in addition to its 
development and price stabilization mandates.

facilitating access to finance. Specific measure taken include reduction of duty on imported capital equipment and spare parts, exemption from 

“Benefice Industrial et Commercial – BCI” and land acquisition taxes, reduced costs of environmental and social impact assessment studies, 

plans for the creation of agro-industrial parks in Yamoussoukro, Bouake and other regional centers, developing a cooperative research Centre 

with FHB Technical Institute and Ho Chi Minh University for the transfer of technologies, technical staff training and technical assistance to 

private sector investors. Furthermore, CCA and the Ministry of Industry and Mines are working with commercial banks and IFC to establish a 

“Risk-Sharing” guarantee fund to provide working capital to processors primarily for RCN purchase and inventory funding. IFC and WB are also 

working with Government Agencies to finalize laws regulating the issue of warehouse receipts that will lower the cost of holding processing 

inventory.   

The need for additional incentives and reforms. The measures already taken to improve the incentives in favor of cashew processing, although 
a necessary and significant first step, may not be sufficient to mobilize the volume of private investments necessary to achieve Government’s 
very ambitious objective. At the present time, Côte d’Ivoire is not competitive with India and Vietnam in the processing of raw cashew nuts. 
Operating large processors in the country, although using the most efficient technology, are facing difficulties to make a profit at the price they 
have to pay in order to be competitive with raw nut exporters. Lack of technical and managerial skills, labor productivity, building and utility 
costs, interest rates, and taxes (official and unofficial) provide part of the explanation. But a bigger problem is the need to constitute a large 
stock of raw material, and finance it at prevailing high interest rates, in order to keep the factory running during the eight months between the 
end of one harvest and the start of the next one. Indian firms can avoid most of this expense by purchasing from different regions of the world 
at different times.  
 
Promoting more processing of raw cashew nuts in Cote d’Ivoire - the way forward. The Government has reviewed what other measures may 
be taken to spur the development of the Ivorian processing industry, on the basis of the lessons learned from other cashew processing 
countries. It is a fact that all other countries with a significant processing capacity have provided some protection in order to promote value 
addition. Brazil has adopted a ban on the export of raw cashew nuts while India, Vietnam, and Mozambique have relied on export taxes on raw 
cashew nuts in the range of 18 to 40 percent, combined with other fiscal incentives. Once such reforms and policies are in place in Cote 
d’Ivoire, a number of significant barriers to entry will be removed. However, some of the main issues causing a lack of competitiveness such as 
labor cost and productivity, technological/processing efficiency and inventory management will take time to overcome. To address these 
issues, CCA is proposing a processing subsidy on exported processed kernels of 80CFA per kg ($135 per Mt) to generate sufficient margins to 
bridge the competitiveness gap and provide a return on invested capital. This processing subsidy is to be funded from a 30 CFA per kg tax on 
RCN exports (about 4 percent of 2016 CFR prices

17
) which will be passed down the value chain to the farm gate. As a result, it will be RCN 

growers who are in effect funding the establishment of the processing sector. There are equity issues associated with this transfer of value 
between a large number of poor rural families to factory owners and their workforce that policy will need to balance. It would thus be 
necessary to use part of these proceeds for the benefit of the producers (who are financing them) to mitigate the negative impact of the levy 
on farm-gate prices and rural incomes. Factories located in the production areas may well employ family members of producing households. 
Higher disposable income from processing workers will also increase other economic activities in the immediate rural economy. But, additional 
investments in the value chain should be considered such as:  (i) boosting agricultural productivity by distributing improved planting material 
and promoting GAPs; and (ii) reducing marketing/transport costs by rehabilitating/constructing rural roads and/or financing other rural 
infrastructure (storage, access to water, etc.)

18
. These investments will increase producer’s productivity (yields and quality) and will lower 

transaction costs in aggregation. This assumes an institutional structure capable of managing significant sums in a transparent matter and 
accountable to the farmers, avoiding the neglects experienced in the coffee-cocoa sector. The industry should be also monitored closely to 
ensure that firms are becoming competitive and that the tax is not serving to protect inefficiency. Ideally, this form of infant-industry 
protection should decline over time to keep the pressure on its beneficiaries to improve their productivity. This principle should be retained, 
especially as the investment climate improves and the profitability of this activity is confirmed.  
 
Ultimately, the development of a processing industry through limited protection and support may be justified as a risk-mitigation measure 
in view of the fact that the alternative is continued dependence on two importing countries. Not to build up local processing capacity could 
mean jeopardizing the entire sector, a sector in which Côte d’Ivoire has proven its comparative advantage in producing the raw material, and 
where it should be competitive in processing under the right conditions and with appropriate incentives in place. Against this background, the 
proposed World Bank loan aims to support the Ivorian Government’s plan to expand RCN processing in Cote d’Ivoire from the current estimate 
of 5-7 percent of production to over 30 percent. Crop production estimates foresee the national crop levelling at around 1.2m Mt of RCN per 
year which implies domestic processing of 400,000 Mt RCN or about 80,000-96,000 Mt of processed kernels depending on the outturn of 
cashew nut kernels

 Cost and freight (CFR) is a trade term requiring the seller to arrange for the carriage of goods by sea to a port of destination, and provide the buyer with the 
documents necessary to obtain the goods from the carrier. 
18

 This practice is already being implemented in the case in the cacao, the rubber and the oil palm sectors.  
19

 The outturn of cashew nut kernels is equal to the amount of usable kernels after shelling the cashew nuts. Generally, outturn ranges between 20 and 24%, but can 
be much higher as well

Succeeding on achieving the Government objective of enhanced value-added transformation will depend not only on increased domestic 

processing, but most importantly on improving the whole cashew value-chain performance and competitiveness. This will entail priority 

setting and funding to increase on-farm yields that remain low, continued strengthening of sector institutions, modernization of marketing, and 

prepare and adapt cashew processing industries and their environment to the requirements of the international markets. Specifically, the 

following key factors will need to be taken into account: (i)  Supply of cashew nuts to processing at competitive costs and adequate quality 

which will depend on overcoming on-farm production challenges and developing basic rural and post-harvest/marketing infrastructure; (ii) For 

domestic processors (and for exporters), clarity of vision on how on-farm productivity will evolve – geographically and with what pace - impacts 

the efficiency of subsequent value chain activities and the profitability of investment decisions. Scale and location of additional processing 

facilities, and building of input supply networks, depend on whether farm production remains low productivity and dispersed, or will begin to 

concentrate geographically and amongst fewer, more professional farmers. Bringing the current spectrum of views closer together therefore 

offers the potential for lower risks and higher interest in additional processing investment, or at the least, lower risks of inefficiently placed 

investment (in space and time); (iii) Local processing industries and enterprises will require to be modernized with the aim to improve their 

competitiveness in terms of price, quality and innovation and also their ability to follow and assimilate the development of technologies and 

markets. This will involve promoting a process of upgrading, modernizing of production tools and industrial subsystems, strengthening 

managerial capacities, developing quality and adopting international standards; (iv) Support measures tailored to SMEs (including taxes and 

other policy adjustments) will have be promoted to enhance their contribution to domestic processing and to boost the creation of jobs for 

young people. Innovation and skill development will contribute significantly to this process by making the most of the demographic dividend; 

and (v) Support in the improvement of other essential infrastructure for industrial activity (access to energy, roads networks, technology 

centers, etc.) is also essential, particularly in disadvantaged regions in northern Cote d’Ivoire. 

 
Relationship to CPF 
 

The proposed Cashew Value Chain Competitiveness Project is aligned with the Country Partnership Framework for the Republic of Cote 

d’Ivoire and supports the achievement of the WBG’s twin goals of reducing extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. Côte d’Ivoire 

wants to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work in agriculture, 

manufacturing and selected services. To help the country reach its potential as world‐class agricultural commodity producer, the CPF program 

FY16-FY19 proposes to address low productivity and jobs in the agriculture, agribusiness and manufacturing value chains, among other within 

the cashew value-chain, which offers high potentials for economic growth, jobs creation and poverty reduction.  

In this respect, the proposed project supports the CPF main Focus Area 1 “Accelerating sustainable private sector-led growth in Cote d’Ivoire” 

and its Strategic Objective 1 “Improve productivity in Agriculture/Agribusiness value chains” to achieve inclusive growth and reduce poverty. 

It supports also the Strategic Objective 3 “Improve business regulatory framework and access to finance” to promote investment in 

agriculture/agribusiness, help spur entrepreneurship and growth opportunities, especially for SMEs.  

The proposed project addresses also the World Bank Africa Region priorities of Agri-business and is well aligned with the Agriculture Global 

Practice’s key priorities areas of inclusive value chains, jobs and partnership with the private sector. It is also consistent with the IFC‐WB Joint 

Agribusiness Strategy, which supports agriculture and agri‐business competitiveness in selected value chains, by improving access to markets, 

provision of technology and training of smallholders, and sector governance reforms.

D. Concept Description 

 
Cote d’Ivoire is the largest exporter of RCN in the world but only process 5-7 percent of this volume into higher value edible nuts. The Ivorian 

processing sector has remained small in the face of intense competition for RCN supply from established processors in India and Vietnam. This 

processing competitive disadvantage is compounded by the presence of internationally financed foreign trading companies who are deeply 

integrated into to processing sector in Asia. The proposed interventions under this loan aim at reversing the current situation by achieving 

transformational changes in the whole Ivoirian cashew value chain in a manner that accelerate its development and performance with a focus 

on increased domestic processing and added-value.  

The Government of Cote d’Ivoire recognizes that expansion in processing capacity will be driven by private sector investment facilitated by a 

clearly defined enabling environment. Key steps have already been put in place to achieve this in the form of an export tax on RCN to fund 

investments in the value chain, a processing subsidy on exported processed kernels that addresses immediate factors of low competitiveness, 

laws and regulations to facilitate working capital requirements and numerous fiscal incentives to reduce investment costs – for instance, the 

WRS regulations adopted recently by the council of Ministers (decrees specifying the terms of application of Law No. 2015-538 of 20 July 2015). 

This Concept Note proposes interventions complementing existing sector policies that tends to lower the barriers to investment in new 

processing capacity and enhance the competitiveness of existing processing capacity. It supports additional investments at critical point along 

the value chain that will: (i) increase RCN productivity on-farm, improve quality and lower aggregation costs; (ii) accelerate private investment 

in new processing capacity through the provision carefully designed and located physical infrastructure that increases operational efficiency 

and significantly lowers the initial cost of investment; (iii) improve the policy and regulatory framework for the sustainable development of the 

cashew value chain in Cote d’Ivoire, including build capacity in all functions along the value chain (technical and managerial skills, knowledge 

and innovation); and (iv) facilitating market development and trade. It is taking into consideration the lessons learned from the WBG 

agriculture portfolio experience and analytical work recently completed in Cote d’Ivoire. These include: (i) learning from the PSAC/IFC and

related analytical work; (ii) the findings of the study “Overview of the cashew sector in Cote d’Ivoire:  Current situation and development 

potential” which provided critical insights and inputs for the preparation of the proposed project; and (iii) other key analytical work carried-out 

by development partners and the Government related to the sector diagnostic, reform and development strategy (see Annex 2 of list of 

references).  

COMPONENT 1: IMPROVING THE ORGANIZATION AND GOVERNANCE OF THE CASHEW VALUE CHAIN ($14.5 MILLION). This component aims 

at improving the organization and governance of the value chain to be able to reduce costs of marketing (from producer to port and to 

consumer) and make the value chain ultimately more competitive. This also includes the strengthening of the various organizations that are 

engaged in the governance of the chain. Building on PSAC/IFC on-going program, the main investments under this component will include the 

following:  

(i) The assessment of existing capacity for public/private sector dialogue (PPD) on the cashew sector, contribution to/co-funding of 

relevant discussion fora, and capacity building of value-chain actors in advocacy for improved business environment. A particular focus will be 

on strengthening: (a) the capacities of the CCA in managing the cashew sector. This would involve measures of organizational development, 

capacity building on leading and managing stakeholder processes, lobbying for a better endowment with staff and financial resources, and 

training on quality control and marketing so staff is able to provide better services to producers, processors and traders. Emphasis should be 

less on control and regulation and more on guidance, advisory services and support; (b) the Ivoirian cashew interprofession, including the 

Union of Cashew Processors
20

. This would also engage measures of organizational development, promotion of benefits to members (e.g. 

political lobbying, service provision and sourcing of equipment in bulk), and capacity building in administration; and (c) the cashew 

cooperatives and their unions and enable them to provide more effectively services and benefits to their members. This involves capacity-

building in all aspects of technical and managerial skills - from good governance, the structure and principles of a cooperative, operational 

management, financial and auditing techniques, business development, marketing plans, and creditworthiness (so that participants can more 

easily obtain loans).  

 

(ii) Promoting an improvement of the relationships between producers/cooperatives/groups and processors/buyers through the 

introduction of more elaborated contracting. This would require sensitization of all actors about the benefits of such contracts, the 

development of contract documents fitted to the conditions in the chain, and support in monitoring compliance. 

 

(iii) Exploring options for combined finance of production and processing. This would involve setting up contractual relationships between 

producers and processors, use of the warehouse receipts as collateral, and educating bankers on the nature of the businesses in the value 

chain. 

 

(iv) Promoting the provision of value chain support services such as technical and business advice and R&D with a focus on cashew 

processing and value-added. Measures to improve such services include fostering the setting up of a network of private service providers, their 

training and their accreditation. 

 

(v) Establishing a geo-referenced information system for the sector to allow for better planning and management of the value-chain - 

collection of reliable information on the number of producers, number of trees/age, volume of production, market evolution and other socio-

economic and ecological factors to facilitate decision-making). 

The actors to be engaged in the implementation of this component include the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Industry and Mines, CCA, 

the Union of Cashew Processors, cooperatives, potential private training and advisory service providers, and the Banks. 

COMPONENT 2: PRODUCTIVITY ENHANCEMENT AND IMPROVED MARKET ACCESS TO RCN PRODUCERS (US$48.5 MILLION). This component 

intents to boost cashew farmers’ productivity on an economically and environmentally sustainable basis. Main outcomes here are in the form 

of an increase in volume and quality of marketable produce in the project areas so as to increase incomes and employment and reduce 

poverty. Direct beneficiaries of the component are 250,000 smallholder cashew producers, mainly in the northern impoverished regions of 

Cote d’Ivoire. To this end, the project will support investments focusing on: (i) support to smallholder production; and (ii) improvement of 

feeder roads and post-harvest infrastructure. Specific interventions will include the following: 

Sub-component 2.1: Support to smallholder production (US$28.5 million). This sub-component will aim at increasing the production (including 

quality) and productivity of cashew producers in the project areas. This will primarily be achieved by facilitating access to: (i) improved planting

materials, fertilizers and agro-chemicals; (ii) training in good agricultural practices; and (iii) extension services to advise on harvest and post-

harvest practices. The following major activities will be implemented: (a) providing support to the national research institutes and nurseries for 

preliminary selection of improved cashew varieties and production of new higher yielding varieties for replacement of old plantations and the 

establishment of new acreage. This will include facilitating access to equipment and inputs, and building the capacity of the national 

agronomists in preliminary selection of improved cashew varieties, handling, storage and distribution; (b) capacity building and training of 

extension staff and cashew producers on improved on-farm practices such as establishment techniques, plant nutrition, planting densities, 

ideal inter-cropping combinations, pruning plans, harvesting, post-harvest storage and quality control, pest and disease management, soil 

conservation/mulching/green residues, book keeping/farm accounts; and (c) launching a fertilizer and phytosanitary treatment program. Given 

the considerable area to be covered by the project, an efficient training scheme across a large population of farmers will need to be 

established. While emphasizing the importance of skills development and capacity building for increased agricultural productivity, the project 

will identify and strengthen potential training and advisory service providers. Capacities among trainers will be also strengthened and these will 

be motivated and equipped to reach farmers. The training content will feature good agricultural practices and environmentally safe use of 

pesticides and will be adapted to local needs, and farmers will be encouraged to organize field days and training events.  

The actors to be engaged in this sub-component include the Ministry of Agriculture, CCA, farmers, cooperatives, agricultural development 

officers on the district and village level, potential private training and advisory service providers, research institutions, seed and plant 
multipliers, and input providers.  

Sub-component 2.2: Improvement of feeder roads and post-harvest infrastructure (US$20 million). This sub-component will aim at improving 
the connection of the main cashew production areas to markets and promote forms of improved storage technology and management of 

stocks based on the Warehouse Receipt System (WRS) being implemented under the PSAC/IFC. Activities related to the feeder roads 

rehabilitation/construction will take into account the national strategy for roads maintenance which includes a partnership between the State 

and private operators (Inter-professional bodies) for the selection of priority roads for rehabilitation/maintenance or construction and the 

parallel co-financing of these activities. Following an inventory of the existing network of rural roads in project areas, a rural road improvement 

program will be developed jointly with the CCA and AGEROUTE (the roads management national agency). The Project will rehabilitate/maintain 

around 1000 km of existing feeder roads and eventually construct about 200 km of new roads. It will also rehabilitate/construct required 

infrastructure representing a critical bottleneck in selected spots (small bridges and culverts). A community-based road maintenance strategy 

will be developed and related road maintenance associations strengthened/formed at community level. In addition, low-cost hand tools and 

equipment will be provided to the community to undertake routine maintenance. The project will learn from the outcome of the joint WB-AFD 

project (PSAC) implementing similar activities in the project areas.  

Activities related to post-harvest technologies will involves an assessment of existing storage facilities
21

, identification of best practices and 

development of a store keeping manual for practitioners, and upgrading and/or developing new storage facilities. To the extent possible, the 

rehabilitation of existing “public” warehouses will reply on public-private-partnership business models. 

COMPONENT 3: SUPPORT TO PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN PROCESSING CAPACITY AND MARKET LINKAGES (US$95 MILLION). This component 

aims at increasing the volume and value-addition of RCN locally processed. Project interventions consist of an integrated mix of activities at 

four different levels: (i) improving the business environment; (ii) facilitating access to investment capital and risk management instruments to 

producers and domestic processors; (iii) supporting for the development of an adequate infrastructure for the establishment of the cashew 

industry; and (iv) market development and trade.  

Sub-component 3.1: Improving the business environment (US$10 million). The cashew industry operating in Cote d’Ivoire faces market failures 

that need to be addressed if this “nascent” industry is to develop and contribute to economic growth, jobs creation and poverty reduction. 

Cooperatives and SMEs are affected more than large firms are by regulation and transaction burdens (business environment constraints), have 

little access to credit (finance constraints), and have limited access to information, advisory services, technology, and innovation (knowledge 

constraints). Under this subcomponent, the project will:  

(i) Revise the existing regulations on cashew nut levies so that their distribution could strengthen CCA and be reinvested into the 

development of the processing sector - for example in capacity strengthening of processors and R&D on technical solutions. 

 

(ii) Assess the regulations and licenses that are required to sell, buy and trade cashew products with the objective to reduce the costs of 
marketing (from producer to port and to consumer) and make the value chain ultimately more competitive. This involves a revision of the 

                                            
21

 Updating the inventory of warehouses and of storage facilities needs which was carried-out under the PSAC/Veritas in 2015.

current procedures in relation to other sectors and practices in other countries, the identification of opportunities for simplification, 

digitalization and streamlining and the testing and implementation of such measures. The project will also support the implementation of the 

new WRS regulations recently adopted through capacity-building benefiting the WRS Regulatory Authority.  
 

(iii) Promote other improvement in the business environment such as: (a) fiscal incentives defined in terms of duration, duty exemptions on 

processing CAPEX, and duty exemption on spare parts and consumable; (b) regional payroll tax exemptions to lower employment costs in 

production zones; (c) subsidy based on kernels produced/exported which should be clarified and defined in terms of duration (currently set by 

the CCA at 80 CFA per kg of RCN processed); and (d) a Fast-track “window” for processing investment incentives. 

 

(iv) Support the creation of new and/or improvement of existing business development services and technology centers that are targeted 

at cashew ago-enterprises for the provision of services such as technical and business advice, R&D, etc. In particular, the project will strengthen 

the Cashew Technology Center currently being established in Yamoussoukro, in partnership with the FHB Technical Institute and the Ho Chi 

Minh University, for the transfer of technologies, the training of the labor force and the provision of technical assistance to private investors. 

The actors to be engaged in this sub-component include the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Industry and Mines, Ministry of Commerce, 

CCA, Union of cashew processors, the Warehouse Regulatory Authority and national technology centres and business development services.   

Sub-component 3.2. Facilitating access to investment capital and risk management instruments to domestic processors  (US$33 million). This 

sub-component will aim at improving access to term finance for investments as well as working capital for the cashew domestic industry and 

will consist of a Financing (line of credit) and a Risk Sharing Facility (RSF). Targeted end-beneficiaries will include new and domestic cashew 

enterprises in need of financing to upgrade/modernize their technology or establish new processing plants (including financing for capital 

investment, capacity expansion and working capital). Selection of PFIs for the line of credit and RSF would be based on clearly defined eligibility 

criteria that would ensure minimum performance and capital, profitability and portfolio quality standards of the PFIs and their ability to 

promote cashew industry development at national level. The volume, lending rates and arrangements of the line of credit and RSF will be set 

appropriately to minimize any potential market distortion, and in compliance with OP requirements for lines of credit. 

 

The project will combine the provision of appropriate financing instruments to banks (line of credit and risk sharing facility) with commitments 

from participating banks to strengthen their lending capability over time to the cashew processing industry. A technical assistance will be 

available under both facilities to support: (i) training for the banks that will benefit from the credit line or RSF, in order to help build capacity in 

lending services to the cashew industry (and agro-industry in general) and ensure that benefiting industry has sufficient capacity to effectively 

utilize loans from the banks for the growth of their businesses; and (ii) advisory services at the industry level to increase their “bankability” – 

preparation of sound business plans (including choice of technology and support for procurement) and loan applications.  

 

Based on preliminary discussions with the stakeholders (government officials, local banks and cashew industry) as well as prior studies, there is 

an acute shortage of financing availability; and the volume of the proposed line of credit as well as RSF is relatively modest yet adequate to 

have meaningful impact and create momentum for Cote d’Ivoire to move up the cashew nut value-chain.  Access, modalities and financial 

terms would include features such as competitive interest rates and maturities in line with on–going commercial practices and consistent with 

the OP10 guideline for LOCs, to ensure that no market distortions are created. The availability period of the LOC as well as RSF would be [5] 

years, and the maturity of loans would be set accordingly, based on further consultation with the stakeholders, to address the shortage of 

financing in particular for investments in the sector and the current gap in the financing offered in Cote d’Ivoire. The RSF will be used to reduce 

the banks’ risk of lending to cashew industry borrowers.  There are other past cases in the region where RSF was deployed effectively in 

agriculture sector (e.g., Mali) and the project will also draw lessons from these experiences.  

 

Sub-component 3.3. Supporting for the development of an adequate infrastructure for the cashew industry (US$42 million). This sub-

component aims at addressing important lacks of infrastructure that limit private investment and hinder the development of competitive and 

inclusive cashew processing industry in the country. It will complement on the forthcoming PIDUCAS project
22

 which plan investments in key 

economic and social infrastructure in Bouaké and San Pedro. It will particularly support the development of a concentrated agro-industrial zone 

in the main producing area of northern Cote d’Ivoire, mainly focused on value addition/agro-processing services of cashew products and by-

products (cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL)
23

, juice, biofuel, etc.). The zone will be developed based on a public-private partnership scheme aiming

 Infrastructure for Urban Development and Competitiveness of Secondary Cities Project (P151324). 
23

 The cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) has important properties which make it valuable for automobile brake linings and paint and varnishes. These by-products are fully 

used in the main processing countries (Brazil, India) and can bring as much revenue as the cashew nut itself.

at facilitating:  (i) access to basic infrastructure; (ii) shared common services and facilities and creation of economies of scale in service 

provision, including storage facilities, transport, quality control services, waste management, etc.; (iii) improved access to technical support and 

information and management services; and (iv) a platform for business linkages between and within value-chain actors through effective 

network between primary producers, agro-processors, traders, retailers and end markets.  

 

Under this sub-component, the project will finance the agro-industrial zone site development and promotion which will include the following 

investments: (i) site identification and assessment based on specific criteria including access roads, site-specific risks, key cost factors, private 

sector interest, etc.; (ii) in-depth technical and economic feasibility studies for the zone development, including a market demand assessment, 

sizing of necessary industrial land, master planning and development, business development plan, environmental and social safeguards, etc.; 

(iii) the construction of the zone’s critical infrastructure (access and internal road network, electricity, communications, and water supply) and 

common services (such administration building, storage facilities, workshop, quality control laboratory, waste disposal, etc.); (iv) investment 

promotion campaign for the site; (v) establishment of its management structure; and (vi) a network of linked sub-regional storage and primary 

processing satellite centres feeding into the agro-industrial zone. 

 
Sub-Component 3.4. Market development and trade (US$10 million). A sustainable outlet for RCN and kernels is a prerequisite to the 
realization of growth potentials in production and processing. Therefore, this component aims at an effective development of domestic, 

regional and international markets for cashew products, particularly kernels. The following interventions are planned: (i) A study related to the 

opportunities for marketing of cashew products (and by-products) locally and internationally. This would engage in a detailed analysis of 

existing domestic and international marketing channels and a projection on most viable options for marketing cashew products with the 

associated standards and quality requirements. Quality control needs to be introduced to the purchase of processed products for local and 

international markets; (ii) Launching a branding and marketing campaign through various channels of mass media (telephone, television, radio, 

billboards, newspapers) to promote cashew consumption among consumers in Cote d’Ivoire. An Ivoirian brand of kernels, eventually to be 

issued by the CCA, will also be promoted on international trade fairs; (iii) Introducing and promoting the application of principles of quality 

control and food safety into processing and marketing of cashew nuts including Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and Good Hygienic 

Practices (GHP) as well as food safety standards such as Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP). This implies promotion of and training 

in good practices in cashew nut production and processing and enforcement of application of quality criteria at the buyer’s level (warehouse 

and retailers); (iv) establishing a market information system that provides efficiently information on prices for raw and processed cashew nuts 

to all stakeholders. This will involve the collection of price data at farm gates, factory gates, warehouse gates, at ports, at major trading places 

(e.g. India), and setting up of a price information service reachable by everybody via telephone and internet, and the continuous analysis and 

publishing of market intelligence; and (v) improving the efficiency in marketing/auctioning raw cashew nuts. This would require working out 

modalities to enable producers and processors getting more direct access to international buyers for raw nuts and kernels and vice versa.  

 

COMPONENT 4: PROGRAM COORDINATION, MONITORING AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT (US$17.5 MILLION). This component will 

facilitate: (i) administrative, technical, and financial management of the program; (ii) coordination among all institutional partners to ensure 

efficient flow of information and support to all value chain actors, in particular the small cashew growers and the processing industry; (iii) 

effective contractual arrangements with key implementing partners (CCA, CNRA, etc.) and other private sector operators; (iv) monitoring and 

evaluation of the performance and the financial, environmental, and social impact of the project; and (v) development of communication 

activities to publicize and disseminate the project results, best practices and success stories.

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)       

 
The project main interventions will be mostly located in the Northern regions of Cote d'Ivoire, where cashew has 
become the most important source of rural cash income. 

 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies       

 
The Recipient has several years of experience in applying and implementing World Bank projects. There are 
considerable legal and institutional frameworks in the country to ensure compliance with World Bank safeguards 
policies triggered by the proposed project. In Cote d’Ivoire, the Ministry of Environment, and Sustainable Development 
(MINEDD) is responsible for setting policy guidelines on environmental issues and ensuring compliance with national 
environmental standards. It has different departments among which the National Agency of Environment (ANDE, 
Agence Nationale de l’Environnement) in charge of safeguards compliance of all projects in the country. The unit is 
well staffed and its capacities are acceptable. With regard to the PCU, capacity building efforts to support project 
implementation will be done by implementing recommendations contained in the safeguards instruments prepared 
for the project. The project will also receive guidance from the Bank’s environmental and social specialists in the 
Project team.

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

This project is planning to finance roads 
rehabilitation/construction with the aim to establish 
the connection of the main cashew production areas 
to markets. For instance, about 200 km of new roads 
will be built and other 1000 km will be rehabilitated 
(see sub-component 2.2). Besides, the project is 
going to support the development of a concentrated 
agro-industrial zone including basic infrastructures 
and storage facilities as well as waste management 
(sub-component 3.3). Based on all potential adverse 
impacts which may be significant and irreversible, the 
project is rated as a category A project. 
 
While the exact locations of these investments are 
not yet known, the proper safeguard instrument to 
be prepared in compliance with this policy is an 
Environmental and Social Management Framework

(ESMF). This ESMF will be reviewed, consulted upon 
and disclosed both in Cote d’Ivoire and at the 
Infoshop at least 120 days before the board 
presentation. 
 
In addition, the project aims at addressing important 
lacks of infrastructure that limit private investment 
and hinder the development of competitive and 
inclusive cashew processing industry in the country 
through the development of agro-industrial zone 
based on a public-private partnership scheme. 
Regarding potential environmental and social adverse 
impacts associated with such an investment, the 
appropriate safeguard instrument to develop is a 
sectoral Strategic Environmental and Social 
Assessment (SESA). The terms of reference for such a 
SESA will be developed, consulted upon and disclosed 
within Cote d’Ivoire and at the Infoshop at least 
120days prior to the board date. But the sectoral 
assessment itself will be carried out as part of the 
project implementation. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

The project will be implemented on areas where 
forests still exist. This kind of environment 
concentrates various insects and others types of 
animals, whose natural habitat could potentially be 
affected by the project’s activities mainly with the 
opening of new road (200 km). However, there is no 
specific safeguard instrument to be prepared. This 
issue will be taken into account by the ESMF. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

Areas where the project’s activities will be 
implemented comprise forested areas. That factor 
could possibly impact the health and quality of 
forests or the rights and welfare of people and their 
level of dependence upon the interaction with 
forests, and it may lead to changes in the 
management, protection or utilization of natural 
forests or plantations. So, special attention may be 
paid in order to avoid or unless minimize adverse 
impacts on forests resources. The ESMF that will be 
prepared in accordance with OP4.01 will provide 
guidance to address matters related to forests 
protection. During the implementation phase, a 
management plan will be prepared if necessary. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 
The sub-component 2.1 will aim at increasing the 
production (including quality) and productivity of 
cashew producers in the project areas. That means

even if the project does not purchase fertilizers and 
agro-chemicals directly, It will induce the use of those 
chemical products by cashew producers for pest and 
disease management. Furthermore, the project 
intends to launch a fertilizer and phytosanitary 
treatment program. Consequently an Integrated Pest 
Management Plan (IPMP) will be prepared, reviewed, 
consulted upon, approved and disclosed in the 
targeted areas, mainly in the north of Cote d’Ivoire 
and at the Infoshop at least 120 days before board 
date. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

Activities supported by the ongoing bank’s funded 
operation such as roads construction/rehabilitation; 
agro-industrial zone, water supply facilities will 
unquestionably involve excavations with possibilities 
to underscore Physical cultural resources. However, 
the triggering of this policy does not entail the 
preparation of a specific safeguard instrument. Only a 
specific chapter will be included in the ESMF to 
provide guidance in case physical cultural resources 
will be discovered. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
There are no indigenous people as defined by the 
policy in the project area. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The planned interventions such as rural roads, agro-
industrial parks, storage facilities are expected to lead 
to land acquisition or restriction of access to sources 
of livelihood. Therefore, a Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) will be prepared for the activities 
triggered by the OP 4.12 as a due diligence given that 
the specific sites or impacts of planned physical 
investments are not known. The RPF will be prepared 
by the Borrower, reviewed and cleared by the team 
and disclosed in country and at Bank InfoShop prior 
to appraisal. The RPF will be used as a guide to 
conduct specific Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) as 
needed, as well as compensation measures to 
minimize negative impacts on Project Affected 
People (PAPs).The RAPs will be submitted to the Bank 
for approval prior to the commencement of the civil 
works. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 No The project will not finance dams nor rely on dams. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

No 
The project is not expected to affect international 
waterways. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No The project will not be located in a Disputed Area.

E. Safeguard Preparation Plan        
 

Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 

Dec 30, 2016 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
The following safeguard instruments are expected to be prepared during the preparation phase: (i) an Environmental 
and Social Management Framework (ESMF), (ii) a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), (iii) an Integrated Pest 
Management Plan (IPMP) and (iv) a Physical Cultural Resources Management Framework (PCRMF) . All these safeguard 
documents will be reviewed consulted upon and disclosed by the Government of the Republic of Cote d’Ivoire, and by 
the World Bank’s Infoshop  at least 120 days prior to presentation of the Project to the Board.

Track II - The review did authorize the preparation to continue

I. Introduction and Context
Country Context
Since 2003, Nigeria has continued to record high, sustained economic growth driven by non-oil 
sector, whereas the performance of the oil sector has slowed down.  Over the last decade, reported 
GDP growth rate has consistently remained between 6 to 8 percent. Key drivers of this strong 
growth are trade (retail and wholesale), agriculture, and telecommunications sectors.  These three 
sectors alone accounted for about 80 percent of GDP growth during 2009-2012. However, annual 
GDP growth rate declined from 7 percent in 2011 to 6.6 and 6.4 percent in 2012 and in the first half 
of 2013 respectively.  Growth has slowed in oil and gas, agriculture and trade but growth in the oil 
sector is slower than in agriculture.  The slowdown in agriculture and trade is related to the impact 
of 2012 flooding which disrupted crop production calendar and growing security problems in some

parts of the country that continues to restrict flows of trade. Oil production has stagnated or declined 
since 2010 due to increasing oil theft in the Niger Delta, and destruction of pipeline infrastructure. 
As a result, oil output in the first half of 2013 was about 10% lower than during the same period of 
2012.   
Rising oil prices ushered in surplus Balance of Payments (BoP) since 2011.  Reserves declined 
however to US$45 billion between April and early October, 2013, reflecting lower oil output,  
weaker oil prices, and more cautious attitudes of investors. While these inflows have strengthened 
Nigeria’s balance of payment and reserve position, they also pose major risk because of its 
vulnerability to shocks or swings in oil prices. Therefore, diversification of the economy is critical if 
Nigeria is to sustain a strong balance of payment position. The Nigerian Government has achieved 
significant budget consolidation since 2011, but dwindling oil production outlook presents fiscal 
uncertainties.   Government fiscal consolidation program is yielding results. Government  deficit 
reduced from an estimated 5.7 percent of GDP in 2010 to 1.9 percent in 2012.  While oil output 
appears poised to recover somewhat in the second half of 2013, Nigeria faces an important 
challenge in that oil revenues are not expected to increase in the medium term at the nearly the pace 
of GDP or the population of the country, reinforcing the need to deepen  significantly other sources 
of Government revenues. 
Nigeria needs effective institutions and good governance to achieve sustainable and inclusive 
growth.  Good governance is critical for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of public 
expenditures and services. Although, some pockets of effectiveness and capability in actually 
implementing reform have emerged, as reflected, for example, in the macroeconomic consolidation, 
consolidation of the banking sector after 2009 crisis, progress in implementing the power sector and 
the agricultural reforms. Important weaknesses and risks that still need to be addressed include the 
enforcement of regulations, inter-agency coordination and supervisory capacity.

Sectoral and Institutional Context
The competitiveness of the agriculture value chains and diversification of the productive base of the 
economy away from oil is a key pillar of the Federal Government’s Agricultural Transformation 
Agenda (ATA). The ATA represents the Government’s renewed focus on value addition to targeted 
commodities for enhanced food security, employment creation and sourcing of raw materials for 
industries and generally for agriculture to serve as engine for a broad-based economic development 
in Nigeria. The ATA is designed to focus on self-sufficiency via import substitution, lowering of 
food costs, increasing real wages and driving down inflation, engendering a rapid transition to an 
export-oriented agricultural economy. It is also to diversify the economy thereby increasing foreign 
exchange reserves, stabilizing the exchange rate and significantly increase the level of foreign direct 
investment (FDI). Key policies and institutional reforms are aimed at: (a) broadening the reach of 
the fertilizer subsidy program and making it more efficient and business oriented; (b) improving the 
investment framework through the development of Staple Crop Processing Zones (SCPZs); (c) 
improving the marketing of agricultural products; (d) promoting investment in productivity-
enhancing technologies. In parallel, the Government seeks to expand and improve large-scale dam 
and irrigation infrastructure which has significant deficiencies that negatively impact agricultural 
productivity, notably in the North where the bulk of Nigeria’s dam and irrigation infrastructure is 
located. 
The agricultural sector is considered an engine of growth capable of generating broad-based 
development outcomes needed for rapid economic transformation. The sector has been central to 
Nigeria’s poverty reduction and employment generation efforts, and retained this importance in 
recent times as the largest contributor to  non-oil growth (40.2% and 34.5%  of GDP in 2011 and in 
the first quarter of 2012 respectively) and important in overall economic growth as well. Self-

sufficiency and import substitution are explicit policy goals of agricultural development strategies in 
Nigeria, resulting from the growing and substantial food import bills  (US$ 2 billion) and policy 
responses (export bans) from a number of exporting countries witnessed during the recent global 
financial and food price crisis.    
The agriculture sector has been growing over the last decade, but not fast enough to meet the food 
security, employment and poverty challenges. Indeed, in recent years, food imports have been 
growing at a faster pace than the population growth (about 11% against,  2.8%) , and though the 
country has met the MDG1 on hunger, still 8.5% of total population were leaving below the  
minimum level of dietary energy consumption in 2011. Low productivity of major staple crops  – 
measured as average yield per hectare - as a result of  very low use of improved inputs , limited 
access to extension services by farmers) and limited investment by the private sector confine the 
sector well below its potential for growth. Power and road infrastructure, low-cost and long term 
financing, access to competitive inputs and supplies, as well as inconsistent policy environment are 
consistently identified by the private sector  as major challenges to their engagement in the sector. 
Rather than trying to drive the entire agricultural sector forward at the same time as in many past 
strategy documents, the ATA focuses on a few key first moves - priority food staples and traditional 
export crops, and intends to develop these for growth and employment creation, with the 
expectation that the rest of the sector will subsequently follow. Within agriculture, a major driver of 
growth is staple food crops, which contributed 35.8 percent to the agricultural GDP in 2011. 
Although in Asia irrigated agriculture was more prominent than in Nigeria, the ATA approach is 
similar to the Asian Green Revolution (GR) strategy, where an initial focus on import substitution 
for wheat and rice in high potential irrigated areas led the successful rural transformation that 
followed. Like the Asian model, the ATA assigns a lead role to the state in driving and orchestrating 
the strategy within each of the selected value chains, and in using financial incentives and import 
charges to encourage this growth. Unlike Asia, however, the ATA aggressively promotes private 
sector-led growth and is relying on public-priva te partnerships rather than state run marketing and 
financial institutions.

Relationship to CAS
The proposed SCPZ Support Project is fully aligned with the World Bank group Agricultural Action 
Plan 2013-2014, and features in the mix of instruments proposed under the New CPS (2014-
FY2017). Indeed the WBG new Agricultural Action identifies agricultural productivity, linking 
farmers to markets, and increasing non-farm income as key areas to put emphasis in order to help 
countries meet the MDG1, in one hand. in the other hand, the overarching objective of the Bank 
new CPS is to support the Government's Visions 20:2020 and Transformation Agenda for inclusive 
economic growth,  through a strategic focus on energy and agriculture sectors as cornerstone to help 
the country reduce poverty and increase shared prosperity. More specifically,  and under the first 
pillar (Federally led structural reforms for growth and jobs), the new CPS aims inter alia at boosting 
agricultural productivity, improving farmers' linkages with agro-processors, and scaling up Nigeria's 
resilience to current and future climate variability. 
The proposed SCPZ support project would contribute to the achievement of Pillar I of the new 
Country Partnership Strategy on growth and competitiveness. The CPS recognized that diversified 
growth and increased productivity is a prerequisite for accelerated poverty reduction and shared 
prosperity. With the dwindling fortune of the oil sector in Nigeria, agriculture offers a sure pathway 
to a diversified and sustained economic growth. However, low productivity and lack of 
competitiveness of the agriculture sector is inextricably linked to poor infrastructure and limited 
access to the market that increases transaction cost and limit margin to the farmers. This project 
would therefore contribute to laying foundation for diversified growth by providing critical public

infrastructure necessary for improved market access and to attract private sector investment in 
agribusiness; a subsector that can offer inclusive and broad development impact. 
The Proposed SCPZ support project will be complemented by ongoing and upcoming operations in 
the World Bank portfolio such as Fadama III/Additional Financing, CADP, WAAPP, RAMP, the 
irrigation project (TRMING), the Development Financing support project, as well as non-Bank-
funded projects supporting  ATA (AfDB-ATASP2, IFAD- Cassava and Value chains support 
project). Those operations are mostly oriented toward improving productivity and ramping up 
production in the SCPZ catchment areas, critical to improving competitiveness of the processing 
segment of the value chains, recognizing that addressing the challenge of low productivity in the 
agriculture sector requires targeted investments in technology, irrigation, rural roads, market 
information, and increasing access to finance. It will also take advantage of sector reforms initiated 
under the series of DPOs; with the second operation focusing inter alia on improving the 
institutional framework and business environment for SCPZ through the preparation of SCZP 
Policy, legal and Institutional framework to foster a predictable business environment for the private 
sector. 
An effective institution is necessary for managing sustainable and inclusive growth and 
competitiveness. Governance represented by deficient institutions can explain the under-
performance of agriculture sector, and its lack of competitiveness. Governance represents the 
foundation for the two pillar of the CPS. The CPS emphasized the fact that the ways in which public 
functions are carried out, public resources are managed and regulatory powers are exercised 
strongly influence the performance of the main sector actors, the focus of sector policies and their 
concrete outcomes. The SCPZ project would support an aspect of this by providing institutional 
development as part of the project design.

II. Proposed Development Objective(s)
Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
The Project development objective (PDO) is to increase market linkages for farmers and strengthen 
the institutional framework for inclusive public and private investment in selected agribusiness 
clusters. 
 
The Project will contribute to the broader objectives of the FGN’s SCPZ Program consisting of 
‘increasing food production and reducing the demand for imports, adding value through processing, 
reducing cost of doing business for processors, and attracting new investment to create jobs, 
especially in rural areas, and to drive the economy’.  The expansion of the agribusiness- farmer 
linkage models under the SCPZ program through the right mix of public and private investments 
will ultimately, improve agricultural productivity, generate shared growth and substantially reduce 
poverty in rural areas.

Key Results (From PCN)
The mandatory corporate indicator on beneficiaries is as follow: Number of direct beneficiaries

III. Preliminary Description
Concept Description
The concept of the Staple Crop Processing Zones under ATA as proposed by the Federal 
Government of Nigeria  is based on the following three guiding principles: (i) take an integrated 
approach to the value chain by addressing critical upstream and downstream bottlenecks and 
facilitating market linkages; (ii) offer a superior operating environment that reduces the cost of 
doing business, and iii) take a private sector-led approach. The Operating Principles are the 
following; (i) investment-driven strategic partnerships with the private sector; (ii) integrated value 
chain approach; (iii) Self-sustaining, government-support and private sector managed. 
  
The SCPZ program aims to channel infrastructure investments to facilitate efficient value chain 
linkages and reduce the cost of doing business, and improve the competitiveness of Nigeria’s agro-
industrial production. By creating an enabling business environment around selected value chains 
clusters, the FGN and State Governments seek to attract private sector investors to set up processing 
plants in high food production areas, in order to boost import substitution, create wealth 
opportunities for farming communities, reduce post-harvest losses, create sustainable employment 
in agro-production, processing and related activities, and drive rapid rural development.  
 
The proposed Project will support the FGN to implement the first model SCPZ and assist in 
building blocks for its sustainable expansion. The project approach to the Government's SCPZs 
Program consists of test running the concept gradually in limited number of sites, as an integrated 
agribusiness supply chain project, with strong farmers –agribusiness linkages aim to overcome the 
multiple, interlocking constraints in infrastructure provision and productivity growth along 
agricultural supply chains. Project will focus its support on Cassava supply value chain in Kogi 
State (at least 70% of project funding), with an open window for limited support in the form of 
technical assistance for up to three other sites/States with strong business case, and  based one 
following minimum criteria :  alignment with Government priority value chains and located in one 
of the SCPZ sites, existing or ready-to-implement  private investment project(s) with sizable 
financing,  high potential for improving agricultural productivity and  generating benefits for 
farmers,  strong support of state Government and local communities, existence of other Bank 
assisted project or partnership with other Donors funded project, and possible IFC intervention. 
 
Project activities will be clustered around the following areas of intervention :  
 
(a) Support to public infrastructure development for the model SCPZ in Kogi State (around 
75% of project total cost) :  consists of  support to Government to develop off-site infrastructure and 
subsequently identify and attract private sector investors willing to invest in on-site development,

operations and maintenance of the zone. The Project is also considering  to  support part of the on-
site infrastructure to guarantee minimum utility services (internal roads, water, gas, power) for up to 
3 private investment projects (covering up to 40% of the 250 hectares of the core zones).  
 
(b) Support to farmers-agribusiness linkage and to economic opportunities along the value 
chains (around 15% of total project cost). In coordination with FADAMA III Additional Financing 
( FADAMA III AF) and other relevant operations in the portfolio, the project will provide support 
to link  farmers, SMEs and communities in the catchment areas with the processing units as  
follows: (i) Improving Farmers productivity: the project will work with agro-processors to 
develop off-take agreements with farmers , aimed at structuring their organizations, and facilitating 
their access to inputs and services, such as  financing, extension, mechanization, land clearing, 
equipment and small scale production and marketing infrastructures,  grading, quality and standards, 
as well as skills development. Project will partner with Fadama III Additional Financing which will 
provide on-farm support to assist farmers deliver on the contracts; (ii) Promotion of economic 
opportunities for the community: The Project will establish a matching grants scheme to support 
activities aim at strengthening agribusiness farmers linkages which could  create jobs and increase 
income for the communities, thus contributing to reducing poverty in the project intervention areas. 
This will include support to women and youths and their groups, promoting development of 
mechanization services, transport, application of chemicals, business planning for SMEs, training , 
financial literacy, and ancillary activities of the value chains. 
 
(c) Institutional development in SCPZ (around 10% of total project cost): (i) Structuring of PPP 
for zone development, operation and maintenance: project will provide support for the 
establishment of a Specific Purpose vehicle (SPV) with a Board inclusive of all relevant 
stakeholders (Federal Government, State Government, Local Government, Developer, and Tenants). 
It is envisioned that the PPP transactions will result in specific contracts between the SPV and 
private investors; (ii) Land and safeguards management: for appropriate management of farm land 
allocation to the nucleus farms and for coordinated implementation of the SCPZ Master Plan in the 
catchment areas, the project will assist the State Government in developing responsible land 
allocation and management procedures following World Bank and international guidelines and 
standards, as well as adequate instruments and M&E system for environmental and social 
safeguards; (iii) Technical assistance to FMARD: The proposed Project will provide institutional 
support to FMARD and the SCPZ-Authority being established to regulate the SCPZS, in terms of 
technical assistance (TA), training, and experience sharing of best practices from across the world, 
and for scaling up the program to other sites based on lessons learnt from the pilot SCPZ in Kogi 
State; (iv) Technical assistance selected States for development of agribusiness clusters: 
Specific TA might include market assessment, SCPZ detailed feasibility studies, attracting private 
investor and structuring PPP, promotion of the program within the country and abroad, etc. The 
project will also support FMARD to support selected States, and upon their request, in developing 
their SCPZ projects. 
 
(d)  Project coordination: dedicated project management and coordination structure will set up 
and early as before negotiations, to initiate the implementation of the project and until the SCPZ 
institutional framework is established and fully operational.

B. Introduction and Context 

 
Regional Context  

The Niger Basin, located in West and Central Africa, is one of the major transboundary basins in Africa. Its 
1.5 million km2 active hydrographic basin spans over the territory of nine countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, 
Cameroon, Chad, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria. Its population of 130 million inhabitants is 
growing rapidly, expected to reach 180 million people by 2025. Except for Nigeria, most of the population in 
the basin is rural and depends on agriculture, animal husbandry or fishing for its livelihood. 
 
The value of the Niger River System resides in its contribution to water, food, energy, and job security, to 
transport and to biodiversity. For thousands of years, the river, its tributaries and connected lakes and 
wetlands have supported local populations with diverse water-dependent livelihoods such as flood-recession 
agriculture, cattle grazing and drinking, fishing and hunting. In the Niger Basin Countries, agriculture (including 
farming, livestock husbandry and fisheries) contributes 20 to 50 per cent of GDP and roughly two-third of the 
population depends on it for its livelihood. Moreover, those mostly family fishing and agro-pastoral systems 
are labor intensive and generate significant indirect employments (processing, trade and crafts). In a region 
with a structural deficit in food production and increasing temperature and rainfall variability and uncertainty, 
the river, its tributaries and connected groundwater resources are key to increase agricultural productivity and 
resilience to climate change. In addition, the river system is important for the energy security of the region, 
with an installed, partially integrated, hydro-power capacity of 2,000MW1. Finally, the Niger hydro-system 
sustains some of the most significant biodiversity areas in the World, notably the Inner2 and Maritime Deltas 
in Mali and Nigeria respectively, both Ramsar sites. 
 
Yet the Niger hydro-system and the population, economies and biodiversity relying on it are vulnerable to 
several climate and water-related shocks and stresses, many of them transboundary in nature. Managing 
competing water demands, notably between upstream and downstream users and between different sectoral 
will be one of the basin’s main development challenges in the coming decades as intensifying water use, while 
necessary, will not be without impacts. Notably, it will be important to strike a balance between the regulation 
of river flows (i.e. reservoirs) and increased water withdrawals for irrigation, hydropower and navigation, as is 
the case of the Upper Niger, Medium Niger and the Benue (i.e. Chad, Cameroon and Nigeria) and the 
preservation of the Maritime Delta ecosystem (i.e. biodiversity and ecological services: fishing) in Nigeria.

and Sector Work. Washington, DC: World Bank. Nigeria is exporting electricity to Niger and Benin in the Niger Basin. 
2 During the rainy season, the Inner Delta forms a large flood plain of 20,000 to 30,000 km2, facilitating the cultivation of rive, cotton 
and wheat as well as cattle herding and fishing. The size of the flooded area is subject to strong annual variations, depending on the 
discharge in the Upper Basin.

Priority should therefore be given to increasing the performance of existing infrastructure; 
reducing/postponing the need to build new dams; as well as strengthening the Niger Basin authority (NBA)’s 
capacity in its water allocation, planning and coordination of transboundary projects function.  
 
In this context, the Government of Cameroon has made a request to the Niger Basin Authority to incorporate 
the Lagdo dam into the Niger Basin Master Plan. The WB is currently supporting the master plan through a 
Niger Basin regional program using the Series of Project (SOP) instrument. Phase 1 (Building Climate Resilience 
in the Niger Basin, P161262) objective is to strengthen the Niger Basin Authority’s capacity for integrated, 
transboundary water resources management, while subsequent phases/projects, including the proposed 
operation, would be for country-level investments. Within the master plan integration, the development of 
irrigation from the Lagdo dam is indicated for Cameroun.

The proposed project is therefore proposed as the second of a Series of Projects under the Regional 
Program. Through in country investments it will contribute to the implementation of targeted, interventions 
for transboundary, integrated water resource management. 
Country Context 

 

A lower middle income country of about 24 million people, Cameroon is strategically located on the gulf of 
Guinea. It is naturally well placed to play the role of a regional hub. With its 600 kilometer coastline, Cameroon 
borders with six Central Africa countries3 which, with the exception of Nigeria, are members of the Economic 
and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC by its French acronym). Its regional port of Douala serves 
as an entry point to two strategic road corridors to Bangui and Ndjamena. Cameroon’s Far North region shares 
with Chad, Niger and Nigeria access to Lake Chad, a basin traditionally important for livelihood in the region, 
but also an area of competition for scarce resources including between farmers and pastoralists. Cameroon is 
endowed with ample arable land, water, energy, and oil and mineral resources.  
 
With a per capita Gross Domestic Product of US$1,374 (current prices) in 2017, the economy is largely driven 
by its primary sector, agriculture and mineral resources, and benefits from its location in the Congo Basin, the 
world’s second largest tropical forest zone, which provides an exceptional ecological diversity. The country’s 
mineral wealth includes deposits of oil, natural gas, gold, iron, manganese and uranium. Crude petroleum is an 
important resource accounting for 10 percent of GDP and being the main export product by value. Timber is the 
second largest export product. Imports are dominated by manufactured goods and come mainly from Europe. 
 
Despite having one of the most diversified economies in the CEMAC region, Cameroon’s economic activity 
slowed in 2016. Growth has dipped to 3.7 percent by the end of 2017, compared to 4.4 percent in 2016. This 
outcome is due to slower growth in oil production (+3 percent in 2016 against 37 percent in 2015) resulting from 
the maturity of the main oil fields, and to the avian flu epidemic that has damaged the local poultry industry, 
particularly in the West, which accounts for 80 percent of production. However, continued implementation of 
the Government’s ambitious infrastructure plan and interventions to boost the agriculture and forestry sectors 
have significantly contributed to sustained strong growth in public works and construction and services. Inflation 
rose to 1.6 percent at the end of June 2016, largely based on the increased tax rate on alcohol (7.4 percent) and 
tobacco in the 2015 budget law, and the 4.9 percent increase in prices for services, restaurants, and hotels. 
 
Cameroon’s ruling party, the Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement (CPDM), has long dominated the 
country’s political landscape and currently occupies 148 of the 180 seats in the National Assembly and 81 of 
the 100 seats in the Senate, which was created in 2013.  Presidential elections are scheduled for 2018.  While 
Cameroon has enjoyed peace for many decades in spite of its highly diverse population, it now faces an 
increasingly challenging situation in its northern regions, where Boko Haram is waging a low intensity war.  This 
has resulted in high levels of insecurity and violence, involving 2,276 fatalities in 2014-2015 alone, loss of 
livestock, and risks associated with normal economic activities such as farming. Cameroon’s northern regions 
are facing a humanitarian and economic challenge: The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 
(OCHA) estimated the number of food insecure people in the northern regions to have increased from one 

                                            
3 Nigeria, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Republic of Congo, and landlocked Chad and Central African Republic (CAR).

million in 2014 to 2.4 million in August 2016, including 253,000 children suffering from severe or moderate acute 
malnutrition. The year 2017 has also been marked by high tensions in the northwest and southwest Anglophone 
regions, which feel marginalized by the rest of the country. 
 
The Government of Cameroon (GoC) long-term vision, Cameroon Vision 2035, is of an emerging, democratic 
and united country in diversity. To operationalize this Vision, the Government adopted a Growth and 
Employment Strategy (DSCE –Document de Stratégie pour la Croissance et l’Emploi) in 2009 and defined specific 
objectives to be achieved by 2020, like to reduce poverty by less than 29 percent and by 10 percent in 2035. 
The GoC has further adopted the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It also endorsed 
the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and published 
Cameroon’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) setting out its contribution to climate change mitigation 
and priorities for adaptation.  
 
The DSCE identifies inadequate infrastructure and an unfavorable business environment as the main factors 
impeding economic growth and employment creation. The agriculture sector, which currently employs about 
70 percent of the active population in Cameroon (primarily in the informal sector), is regarded as the engine for 
economic growth and job creation if it can be transformed from traditional farming to diversified and 
commercially viable farming (see below). The DSCE recognizes the need for agricultural diversification, increased 
productivity, and large-scale public investment projects in the sector. In fact, notwithstanding Cameroon’s 
abundance of natural assets and tremendous climatic and land potential, the primary sector’s contribution to 
growth is very limited, about one percentage point of GDP p.a., and is dominated by food crops grown by 
smallholder farmers.  
 
As population growth outpaces poverty reduction, the number of poor increased between 2007 and 2014 by 
12 percent to 8.1 million people, with important regional disparities. The northern regions exhibit by far the 
highest poverty rates in Cameroon, with an estimated 56 percent of the poor living in the North and Far North 
regions alone. In these two northern regions poverty and inequality levels have steadily increased over time 
relative to the rest of the country where poverty and inequality have declined. They are subject to multiple 
poverty traps, which are documented extensively in the World Bank Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD, Report 
103098-CM)4, including low agriculture productivity, increasing vulnerability to climate change, poor 
infrastructure, and limited access to health and education services.  
 
Poverty incidence is correlated with agro-ecological zones. The northern regions of Cameroon, i.e., the four 
poorest regions (the Far-North, the North, the North-West and the Adamawa), belong to three agro-ecological 
zones – the Sudano-Sahelian, the Western Highlands, and the Guinea Savannah zones which together account 
for 80 percent of all poor (see figure below). In the largely arid Sudano-Sahelian zone, comprising the Far North 
and North regions, agricultural output (millet, maize, peanuts, and cotton) depends heavily on rainfall. Animal 
production is also vulnerable to drought. In this zone 72 percent of the population or 56 percent of all poor live 
below the poverty threshold. In the Western Highlands, comprising the North-West and West regions, there is 
a cattle and coffee based system with corn, (coco) yams, potatoes, and peanuts as the main food crops. Thirty-
nine percent of the population in this agro-ecological zone (but as much as 55 percent in the North-West region)

live below the poverty threshold representing 18 percent of all poor. Twenty percent of the poor live in the 
remaining two agro-ecological zones. 
 
 
Figure 1: Cameroon: incidence of poverty by agro-ecological zone  

Social and economic gaps between 
regions are likely to worsen as a result of 
climate change. The Sudano-Sahelian area 
(North and Extreme North) is the most 
environmentally fragile zone in Cameroon. 
It is particularly exposed to drought and 
increased temperatures with serious 
implications for the majority of inhabitants 
who depend on agriculture and livestock 
for their livelihoods. Regional climate 
change projections suggest that an overall 
decrease in the quantity of the water 
available could exacerbate water 
shortages in many rural areas of northern 
Cameroon. The quality of water will also be 
affected. An increase in temperatures and 
greater dryness are likely to result in net 

capillary movement and the salinization of both water and soils. Rice, one of Cameroon's main food imports, 
grown in the north by both traditional and modern methods, will particularly be affected, but also other food 
crops such as millet, sorghum and maize.  
 
 

Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 

Agriculture remains the backbone of Cameroon's economy, employing 70 percent of its workforce, while 
providing 42 percent of its GDP and 30 percent of its export revenue. Blessed with fertile land and regularly 
abundant rainfall in most regions, Cameroon produces a variety of agricultural commodities both for export and 
for domestic consumption. Coffee and cocoa are grown in central and southern regions, bananas in 
southwestern areas, and cotton in several northern provinces. In addition to export commodities, Cameroonian 
farmers produce numerous subsistence crops for family consumption. Principal food crops include millet, 
sorghum, peanuts, plantains, sweet potatoes, and manioc. Animal husbandry is practiced throughout the 
country and is particularly important in northern provinces. The great majority of Cameroonian farmers are 
small-holders, generally obtaining low yields from small plots of land using traditional methods: handheld hoes 
and animals for draught power. Cash crop production is also done by small holders. Food crops contribute 64 
percent to agricultural GDP, followed by livestock (13 percent), forestry (9 percent), industrial and export crops 
(8 percent), and fisheries (6 percent). About 54 percent of all households have at least one member who owns 
a crop field of about 2.4 hectares (ha) as documented in the DSCE.

Yet, a series of constraints have led Cameroon’s agriculture sector to be characterized by low productivity 
and low-production subsistence farming. Declining soil fertility, limited use of fertilizer, low adoption of high 
yielding varieties and improved farming techniques are among the core reasons for constrained yields. 
Techniques and approaches to address these constraints exist, and Cameroon is blessed with a multitude of 
high quality agricultural research institutions. Nevertheless, the adoption of improved practices remains limited, 
as no functional extension system is in place, as evidenced by the size of the yield gaps. The main constraints 
are: (i) Limited access to inputs (less than 7 kg/ha of fertilizers are used; the use of improved seeds is lower than 
30 percent); (ii) Very limited mechanization: Cameroon has a ratio of 0.1 tractor/1,000 ha and a mechanization 
ratio of only 0.1; (iii) Weak institutional capacity of Producer Organizatons (POs) associated with limited 
storage/processing capacity and marketing infrastructure; (iv) Lack of storage and marketing infrastructure, 
aggravated by the isolation of agricultural production areas because of the poor quality of rural roads, which 
comprise 80 percent of the national network (only 5.2 percent or 4,200 out of 81,000 km are in good condition); 
(vi) Limited access to credit/rural finance: POs and SMAEs have limited access to credit/ rural finance because 
of their inability to present viable projects for financing, the (perceived) high cost of financing, and the absence 
of specific financial services/instruments for their segment; and (vii) The size of traditional family farm 
enterprises, of which 63 percent are too small (less than 2 ha) to profit from non intensive agriculture.  
 
Meanwhile costly and poorly targeted subsidies do not benefit the poorest, distort the market and increase 
food dependency. In an effort to mitigate the negative effects of the 2008 rise in food and fuel prices, the 
Government launched a universal subsidy program (food and fuel), which by 2011 was costing the Government 
around 2.7 percent of GDP. In 2013 more than US$100 million was spent to subsidize fish, wheat and rice alone. 
These subsidies benefit the urban middle and upper class and only very small amounts (between 2 percent and 
27 percent depending on the food item) benefit the poorest 40 percent. These persistent subsidies and the 
attempts to stabilize the market through interventions act as a disincentive for local food production and not 
only aggravate rural poverty, they also sustain the country’s dependency on food imports. In addition, as 
Cameroon is well placed to serve a sub-region that has high purchasing power and is structurally deficient in 
food, distortionary policies impact negatively on trade competitiveness. 
 
Agriculture, livestock management and agro-forestry are not only sectors in which the majority of the poor 
are engaged, they are also sectors of competitive advantage. This is based on three observations. The first is 
that Cameroon has factor endowments rich in unskilled and semi-skilled labor and natural resources. Cameroon 
has a unique bio-diversity and is the custodian of global public goods such as the rainforest in the Congo Basin. 
Only 29 percent of arable land is cultivated, and below 3 percent of irrigable land is irrigated. It thus has a 
comparative advantage in primary products, agriculture, environment and mining. The second is that high 
indirect costs on doing business are less limiting on agriculture, pastoralism and agro-industry than they are on 
more sophisticated manufacturing or high-tech, tradeable services. The third is that Cameroon does not meet 
the internal nor regional demand for cereals, meat and animal products and the agricultural trade balance is 
negative. 
 
Improving the functioning of value chains for staple food crops is particularly important for poverty reduction. 
Poor households spend a larger share of their budget on food than non-poor households do. Moreover 
households in the two poorest wealth quintiles ‘specialize’ in the cultivation of food crops like maize, millet,

sorghum, yams, banana, cassava, and beans. These crops are also the staple foods for the poorest households, 
implying that improvements in production and commercialization for these crops would have the double benefit 
of increasing farm incomes and reducing food prices for the urban poor who rely on food purchases. Many rural 
poor will benefit from lower food prices as many are net food purchasers. Good results are already being 
achieved by linking farmer cooperatives producing millet and sorghum with large industrial enterprises like 
Guiness. The value chain for milk similarly offers great opportunities, as does the value chain for poultry, meat, 
eggs or chickenfeed. 
 
The presence of significant yield gaps for the most popular crops suggests scope for productivity increases. 
Assessing actual crop yields against maximum attainable levels offers important insights into the performance 
of agriculture and the potential for yield growth and expected productivity gains from agricultural investments 
and policies, including land and water resources management. The yield gap for Cameroon is substantial. The 
largest differences are for sweet potato, rice and cassava, with yield gaps of 78, 75 and 73 percent. Sorghum, 
maize and potatoes also have sizeable yield gaps of respectively 63, 67 and 64 percent.5 
 
In a context of improved yields, there is significant potential for the (domestic and regional) markets to absorb 
increased food production. Already the demand for food in Cameroon exceeds supply as evidenced by the large 
amount of food that is imported. Also the high levels of chronic malnutrition –particularly in the north of the 
country, point in the direction of an unmet demand for food. Moreover, there is a large demand for food in the 
region. Nigeria is a huge market and rice, maize and onions already find their way to markets in Nigeria, but also 
in Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo. But even domestically the demand for food will rise rapidly 
due to an annual population growth rate of 2.8 percent and increased urbanization. However, the formation of 
a middle class will be accompanied by the demand for food products with a high income elasticity such as rice, 
milk and milk products, eggs and meat. 
 

On land issues, a main principle is lands belong to the State. The Government of Cameroon (GoC) has initiated 
a land reform process over 10 years ago and a draft land law is currently being reviewed at the presidency 
level. While the proposed law is not yet being shared outside the Government, preliminary analyses suggest 
that it does not contain any major innovations likely to address the dysfunctions of the land sector. It does not 
seem to be based on the definition of a fundamental land policy addressing issues across the various sectors 
(agricultural, pastoral, forestry, environmental, industrial, urban). Moreover, the proposed law barely seems to 
address the issue of recognition of customary land rights but rather there seems to be a desire to strengthen 
the role of the State in land ownership and the constitution of public land reserves. It is, however, questionable 
when the new land law would be adopted given the political sensitivity of land issues in a context of upcoming 
presidential elections in 2018 and increasing tensions and fragile situations in several regions of the country. 
 
Despite the many challenges it faces, the GoC is committed to increase investment in the agriculture sector 
for poverty reduction and economic growth. A growth strategy that focuses on products cultivated by the 
poorest has a greater likelihood of successful poverty reduction, and as the majority of the poor can be found 
in the rural areas of northern Cameroon, a poverty reducing growth strategy would focus on the value chain 
development of coarse grains (rice, maize, millet, and sorghum) but also livestock, beans and cotton, which is

the main cash crop grown in the Northern regions. In this context, the GOC’s agriculture strategy is expressed 
in three key national strategy and planning documents: (i) «Vision 2035» envisages agricultural growth beyond 
5 percent by 20209; the DSCE foresees significant productivity increases in agriculture and livestock farming; (ii) 
the 2005 - 2009 Rural Development Strategy and its 2013 update (“Document de Stratégie de Développement 
du Secteur Rural,” - DSDSR) commit to a modernization of rural infrastructure and agricultural production and 
sustainable management of natural resources; and (iii) Cameroon has engaged in the African Union’s 
Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP), and with CAADP support, Cameroon is 
currently finalizing its 2014-2020 National Agriculture Investment Program (“Plan National d’Investissement 
Agricole,” - PNIA11).  
 

Cameroon aims to articulate and implement a more robust public expenditure program to improve sector 
performance. This would necessitate an examination of the national budget level benefiting the sector, which 
currently remains below 5 percent of the total budget (compared with the CAADP target of 10 percent), as well 
as a review of the quality of expenditure planning, allocation, and implementation. To this effect, the agriculture 
sector ministries (MINADER and the Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries, and Animal Production) with support from 
the Bank are currently finalizing an agriculture sector public expenditure review to identify bottlenecks, 
inefficiencies, and deviations from the policy goals. The review, which is expected to be completed by the 
effectiveness of the proposed project, will analyze growth of agriculture on a macroeconomic scale within the 
framework of a computable general equilibrium model. This model will analyze the role of relative prices, public 
expenditure, and exchange rates on the growth in the sector. This tool will also development partners to help 
decide how to increase the financial resources dedicated to agricultural development. 
 
Within this framework, the Government of Cameroon asked support from the World Bank to improve 
irrigation services and sustain climate resilient agricultural productivity in the Benue River Valley, in the North 
of Cameroon. One of the poorest regions in the country, highly populated, and with a history of immigration 
pressure from the extreme North, the North region is within the Sudano-Sahelian Savanah agroecological zone. 
Of the five agroecological zones of Cameroon, the Sudano-Sahelian (North and Extreme North) is the one with 
the shortest rain-fed season (March to September, Figure 2 below).  
 

 Figure 2: Rainfall patterns in different Agro-ecological Zones. The Sudano-Sahelian zone (in the yellow frame) is the one with the shortest season, 
and with the least amount of precipitation.

In this zone, the potential Evapotranspiration (ETP) is never fully satisfied by the amount of monthly rainfall, 
inducing a permanent deficit (figure 3 below). This translates into water stress and reduced photosynthesis and 
therefore yields. In this zone improved water storage, water harvesting, and irrigation are critical to improving 
farm production. Improved water management also enhances the ability to withstand climatic shocks and is 
commensurate with a strategy whereby the production of staples is promoted in rain-fed systems and 
production of high value cereals (e.g.  rice), horticultural cops, and industrial crops in irrigated systems. With an 
enormous untapped potential for irrigation (a 5,900 million m3 Lagdo reservoir) the Benué Valley if correctly 
developed will have a significant impact in improving the life of hundreds of thousands of people through 
economic growth, poverty reduction, social stabilization, and reduced vulnerability.

Different groups of poor people can be expected to benefit from increases in agricultural productivity in the 
Benué Valley. Poor farmers will benefit from higher incomes brought about by productivity gains while non-
farmers in rural areas benefit from spill-over gains. When increased agricultural productivity leads to increases 
in food production, lower food prices will benefit the urban poor and net food buyers in rural areas, often the 
poorest. This is not inconsequential. High transportation costs make food an imperfectly tradeable commodity. 
An important transmission mechanism from agricultural productivity to aggregate growth is through the price 
of food, as it allows sustaining lower labor costs in the rest of the economy. 
 
The proposed project may qualify for a high adaptation and mitigation co-benefits in the form of adoption of 
Climate Smart practices, reduction in irrigation energy use, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest 
degradation and agricultural management activities that improve carbon pools. Project activities proposed 
under components 1, 2 and 3 are included on the “List of activities eligible for classification as climate mitigation 
finance” in the 2016 Joint Report on Multilateral Development Banks’ Climate Finance under category 4, sub-

category 4.1 and 4.2. In compliance to the corporate mandate included in the Environment Strategy endorsed 
by the board in 2012, a preliminary GHG assessment using conservative boundary values has been performed 
for this project using the Ex-Ante Carbon Balance Tool (EX-ACT).  Preliminary results show that the project 
creates a total net carbon sequestration of 337,558 tCO2-eq. Watershed management provided the largest 
potential for mitigation co-benefits. An updated GHG assessment will be performed during the appraisal stage. 
 
 

Relationship to CPF 
 

The project objective is fully consistent with the Cameroon Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for 2017-2021 
to support poverty reduction and shared prosperity in Cameroon. The FY17-FY21 CPF succeeded the Cameroon 
Country Partnership Strategy (FY10-FY13, report number - 52997), which was extended until FY14 by the 
Progress and Learning Report considered by the Executive Directors in October 2012. The CPF draws on a 
comprehensive Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD, report 103098-CM), completed during FY16, which 
identified constraints to achieving the World Bank’s Twin Goals of eliminating poverty and fostering shared 
prosperity in a socially and environmentally sustainable way. Despite more than a decade of economic growth, 
national poverty incidence has remained almost unchanged.  Poverty decreased slowly as a percentage of 
population, from 40.2 percent in 2001 to 37.5 percent in 2014, and its incidence declined in urban areas from 
17.9 percent to an estimated 8.9 percent during the same period.  In rural areas, on the other hand, the 
percentage of poor increased from 52.1 percent to 56.8 percent.  Even though urban poverty declined 
significantly in relative terms, the absolute number of urban poor declined only slightly, by 300,000, because 
the urban population increased by approximately 4.1 million since 2001. In rural areas, higher poverty incidence 
resulted in 1.1 million additional poor people. Overall, the absolute number of poor in Cameroon increased by 
approximately 800,000 since 2001. 

 
The CPF has concluded that in the short-term, the largest opportunity for increasing shared prosperity and 
reducing acute poverty in Cameroon is an improvement in rural livelihoods, largely based on agriculture.  Eighty-
five percent of all poor people live in the countryside. Of these a majority live in the Sudano-Sahelian areas of 
the North and the Far North regions. Cameroon has a strong potential to increase agriculture productivity. It 
has a comparative advantage in primary products based on a relative abundance of natural resources and 
unskilled and semi-skilled labor. There is also significant unmet internal demand for cereals, meat and animal 
products. The development of labor-intensive agro-industry could offer a path towards more diversified, 
complex and higher value forms of manufacturing. Key issues include low agricultural yields, limited 
infrastructure for transportation, delivery, and storage, as well as the need for improved irrigation and water 
harvesting to improve farm production in some areas.  
 
The proposed project addresses the key issues identified in the CPF and promotes natural resources and water 
management, irrigation, and agriculture under a participatory landscapes approach, with a specific focus on 
land tenure rights security.  Irrigation (as major investment component) will be expanded from reservoirs 
already developed on the Benue River which would provide safeguard against climate change impacts and 
increased occurrence of droughts. The supporting project components are aligned to development and 
dissemination of new agricultural technologies, climate-resilient rainfed agriculture, enhanced market linkages 
for small and marginal farmers, and improved natural resource management in the upper catchment areas of

the Benue River. Further the project will have positive impact in terms of environmental protection, and reduced 
greenhouse emissions by disseminating high efficiency irrigation systems, particularly for high value crops, 
which significantly reduce water consumption. The proposed project would also improve the sustainability and 
reliability of rainfed agriculture and small-scale irrigated agriculture in the Benue River Valley downstream of 
the Lagdo dam with better flood protection features. Thus the proposed project will be closely aligned to the 
findings and recommendations contained in the CPF. 
 
Link with other existing projects. The proposed Project builds on previous work and results of the Flood 
Emergency Project (PULCI - P143940) for component 2 and 4, and will closely coordinate with the Agriculture 
Investment and Market Development Project (PIDMA - P143417) for component 3. PULCI, following previous 
work from PACA (P112635), is working to improve irrigation and flood protection in a sustainable manner for 
the riverine population of the Far-North. Furthermore, the Bank is currently undertaking a AAA for increasing 
climate smart agriculture in Northern Cameroon. In addition, the project will collaborate with the regional 
initiative Building Climate Resilience in the Niger Basin (P161262) whose objective is to strengthen the Niger 
Basin Authority’s capacity for integrated, transboundary water resources management, being the Benue valley 
part of the Niger basin.” 
 
 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
I. The Overall Series of Project Program  

  

The Program Development Objective is to strengthen NBA’s capacity for integrated, transboundary water 
resources management and support the implementation of the Regional Climate Resilience Investment Plan 
(CRIP).   
  
The program activities focus on two broad areas:   
  
Strengthening of ABN’s capacity for transboundary, integrated water resource management (WRM) investing 
in Planning and feasibility studies, Environmental Information System and associated decision making tools, 
Operationalization of the Water Charter, and Strengthening NBA’s operational capacity, dissemination of good 
practices and project implementation support; and  
  
Support of the implementation of the CRIP focusing on transboundary activities. Among the numerous activities 
planned in the CRIP two types of activities have been selected: activities aimed at improving the performance 
and safety of large, existing transboundary infrastructure (mostly for hydropower and irrigation) in order to 
postpone the need to develop further large dams and their potential damages on riparian countries and 
measures to manage transboundary contributions to flood and sedimentation.   
Among the potential activities are the following: (i) Improving the performance and safety of key existing 
hydropower dams, such as, for example, the Kainji and Jebba dams in Nigeria, the Sotuba and Selinge dam in 
Mali, and the Lagdo hydropower dam in Cameroon, with its interconnection to Chad; (ii) Improving water-use 
efficiency of the “Office du Niger” in Mali; and (iii) Addressing Niger River sedimentation and recurrent flooding 
in the “Moyen Niger” and “Benoué tributary” through water conservation measures in Burkina Faso, Cameroun

and Benin among others.  
 
 

 
II.  Proposed Development Objective(s)  

  

The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve irrigation services and sustain climate resilient 
agricultural productivity in the Benue River Valley located within the administrative region of North, in 
Cameroon.   
  
This would be achieved through sustainable management of the water resources generated in the Benué River 
catchment area and flowing to the reservoir impounded behind the Lagdo dam, as well as of the regulated river 
flows downstream of the dam for irrigated agriculture. In addition, flood mitigation and protection measures 
on the Benue River system downstream of the Lagdo dam will enable sustainable rain-fed agriculture in the river 
valley. Support to livelihoods in the Lagdo reservoir and improved feed availability for livestock due to increased 
production of crops would improve off farm rural incomes resulting in shared prosperity.   
  
 
Key Results (From PCN) 

 

The Key Project Indicators (KPI) will be:  

a) Area provided with new/improved irrigation and drainage services (in Has, Core Indicator); 
b) Increase in irrigated  area (hectares) under vegetables as well as cereal crops; 
c) Increase in climate resilient agricultural productivity (yield/ha) of various crops grown in the project 

areas; 
d) Number of farmers reached with agricultural assets or services.   

 
 
 
D. Concept Description 

 

1. Description 
 
Introduction/Background: The project area covers the Benue river valley located in North Cameroon 
Administrative Region, one of the poorest regions of the country. The Lagdo multipurpose dam was 
constructed on the Benue River over the years 1978-1982. At completion, the storage volume in the reservoir 
impounded behind the dam was about 7,700 million cubic meters. A hydropower plant was established with 
72 MW installed capacity and allowance was made for provision of water for irrigation of about 11,000 ha 
(about 6,000 ha along the right bank of the river and about 5,000 ha along the left bank of the river). The 
hydropower station has been operating since 1982 but the irrigation development did not take place as 
originally envisaged. About 800 ha were developed on the right bank in 1992. The reservoir storage volume 
has been impacted over the last 30 years by sedimentation and currently the storage volume available is

estimated to be about 5900 million cubic meters based on bathymetric surveys completed in 2005. The project 
would support the sustainable management of the Benue watershed, the development of irrigated agriculture 
on both banks of the river immediately downstream of the river as well as in the river valley below, and the 
improvement of agriculture practices in the valley, including land tenure right management. In accordance with 
World Bank OP 4.37, project financing would include aspects related to safe operation of the dam and 
appurtenances. The total project cost is expected to be about US$ 200 million for a duration of seven years. 
The project will have the following components. 
 

Component 1: Watershed Management (US$ 5M IDA, US$ 10M regional IDA, US$ 15M Total) 
 

The primary goal of this component is to reverse the process of degradation of the natural resource base and 
improve the productive potential of natural resources and incomes of the rural households in the watershed 
sustaining the Lagdo reservoir while improving the operation and safety of the dam. The secondary goal is to 
maintain the quality and quantity of water of the reservoir through sustainable operation and maintenance. It 
will finance watershed interventions, consulting services, technical assistance and equipment along the 
following.  
 

Watershed management: Prior to the construction of the dam and impoundment of the reservoir at Lagdo, the 
population farmed the reservoir area after the recession of flood flows each year. After the impoundment some 
of these farmers have moved to the periphery of the reservoir and have been cultivating there. Tillage of lands 
and cultivation induces soil erosion in these areas resulting in sediment deposition in the reservoir. In addition, 
the reservoir is an important source for fisheries development. Cutting of firewood to smoke the fish, a common 
practice in Cameroon, resulted in deforestation further contributing to erosion and sedimentation in the 
reservoir. This subcomponent will introduce sustainable practices to manage the watershed. It will mobilize 
community participation in watershed development and management aimed at integrating land-water use to 
reduce soil erosion, retain moisture and produce biomass, while enhancing incomes and livelihood options. 
Non-arable land development: interventions will be aimed at (i) ecological rehabilitation of the catchment by 
carrying out soil and water conservation measures through site specific treatment plans, and (ii) narrowing the 
gap between biomass production and consumption in degraded areas. Arable land development: This 
subcomponent will improve cropping systems through promoting adoption of new agronomic practices, and 
fisheries, crop diversification, water harvesting technologies and optimal use of natural sources. Effort for 
improving land tenure security as an incentive to use these new agronomic practices and technology will be 
included in this subcomponent. Funds would be provided to secure appropriate expertise in this regard and to 
implement the measures described above as appropriate. Funds would be provided to secure appropriate 
expertise in this regard and to implement the measures described above as appropriate. This subcomponent 
can be assigned Mitigation co-benefits as financed activities will lead to net reduction in GHG emissions. 
 
Component 2: Water Infrastructure rehabilitation, development and maintenance (US$ 45M IDA, US$ 90M 
regional IDA, US$ 135M Total) 
 
The goal of this component is to rehabilitate and develop water infrastructure that will ensure dam operation 
and safety downstream of Lagdo and allow irrigated agriculture in 11,000 ha, a potentially game changer for the 
rural economy of the North of Cameroon. It will finance studies, consulting services, works and equipment along

North Cameroon Agriculture and Water Smart Landscapes Project (P166072)

the following three subcomponents. This component may qualify for both climate change adaptation and 
mitigation co-benefits . 
 
Subcomponent 2a:  Sustainable operation and maintenance of Lagdo Dam and Reservoir Complex: The Lagdo 
Reservoir impounded behind the Lagdo Dam provides water for power generation and irrigation of lands located 
immediately below the dam on both banks of the river, and is designed to provide flood modulation as well. The 
lake is also a resource for fisheries. Funds would be provided to improve the water inflow forecasts through 
provision of updated electronic meteorological equipment in the catchment and to improve the modeling 
capabilities of Eneo, the operator of the dam. (Eneo, the Energy Company of Cameroon, is responsible for power 
generation and distribution in the country but has also been given the overall responsibility of Lagdo dam 
operation – power generation, irrigation releases, flood releases, and safety of the dam).  The dam is owned by 
the Government of Cameroon (MEADEN) with Eneo operating under an umbrella contract for energy generation 
and distribution throughout the country with other assets as well.  Currently the dam is being inspected 
periodically by a national expert panel. Funds would be provided to set up an independent dam safety panel 
with specific Terms of Reference in accordance with Dam Safety Guidelines of the World Bank. The Dam was 
built in early eighties. The international standards for design floods and flood evacuating mechanisms have 
changed substantially during the last four decades. The Hydrologic computations for the dam/reservoir complex 
would be revisited and if required the design floods would be revised on the basis of today’s standards. Hydraulic 
computations would also be revised to ensure flood handling mechanisms are adequate to meet current 
standards. Funds would be provided to carry out the required studies and analysis using reputed firms. Funds 
would be provided to make any structural modifications required to the dam and spillway arising out of these 
studies. Improved emergency preparedness plans would be prepared using up to date maps and technology for 
a flooding early warning system. This sub-component may qualify for climate change adaptation co-benefits. 
 
Subcomponent 2b: Irrigation infrastructure to utilize direct water releases available from the Reservoir 
(11,000ha) – Provision was made in the original design of the Lagdo Dam Complex to provide irrigation water 
to irrigate lands situated on both banks of the river immediately downstream of the river. Original designs 
allowed for gravity irrigation of about 6,000 ha on the right bank and about 5,000 ha on the left bank. However, 
only limited irrigation infrastructure was built along the right bank covering about 1,000 ha and no infrastructure 
including release offtake was built on the left bank. In order to utilize the water resource asset already provided 
for in the reservoir for agriculture development, funds would be provided to update the feasibility studies 
carried out earlier covering the irrigation areas on both banks and to prepare detailed designs, cost estimates 
and bid documents for the left bank infrastructure in its entirety. Notional cropping patterns will be developed 
during project preparation on the basis of soil suitability, climate factors and irrigability. Funds would be 
provided for the construction of all requisite infrastructure for the development of the 5,000 ha on the left bank 
including the offtake at the dam.  
 
On the right bank, infrastructure developed for the 1,000 ha requires rehabilitation and modernization.  Funds 
would be provided to update the feasibility studies carried out earlier for the right bank as well as detailed 
designs and cost estimates covering the total gravity command of 6,000 ha. Funds would be provided for 
rehabilitation/modernization of irrigation infrastructure covering 1,000 ha. On the left bank the GoC intends to 
have private-sector led commercial investors. Options of IFC supporting this investment are being considered

and will be further developed at preparation. The project will propose some legal mechanism to improve land 
tenure right security for all the stakeholders involved in the irrigation schemes. Funds would be provided for 
the construction of primary irrigation infrastructure covering the remaining 5,000 ha on the right bank.  
 
Subcomponent 2c: Technical Assistance for Irrigation Management. This Subcomponent will address the 
daunting challenge of ensuring the long-term viability of the irrigation and drainage services delivered on the 
irrigation schemes.  The approach will be to implement a progressive management transfer to users’ regulated 
bodies in the form of WUAs and to autonomous professional operators, either public or private.  The approach 
will be first piloted in the right bank, which is the ‘first mover’, starting with the areas to be rehabilitated.  The 
investments under this Subcomponent would support the development of a detailed training strategy with 
associated learning materials to re-align existing WUAs and establish new ones to achieve a transformed 
institutional structure for effective water management.  
 
Component 3: Agriculture Production (US$ 40M, IDA) 
 
The fundamental needs of Cameroon to increase production and enhance productivity in the North (especially 
with irrigation and particularly of smallholders), reduce vulnerability, boost rural employment, and provide 
environmental services come in a context where agriculture is challenged by extreme weather, increased 
market risk, too-slow progress in raising rural incomes in some regions, and too-slow progress in improving 
nutrition, especially for women and infants. Agriculture is the main activity of the households (88%) of the area. 
Globally it is extensive agriculture with low production dominated by cereals (maize and sorgho), groundnut 
and cowpea as food-crops and cotton as cash-crop. Within the riverbanks, small plots of onions, tomatoes and 
other vegetables can be found. Social studies show an abundance of labor force. The markets are in Lagdo and 
Ngong, being also intermediaries that re-sell the primary products in Garoua and Ngaoundere. This component 
will focus on production, linking farmers to markets, and support services. It will finance grants, training, works, 
equipment, workshops and studies along the following sub-components. 
 
Subcomponent 3a: Climate Smart Agriculture – Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) is an approach for reorienting 
agricultural systems under the new realities of climate change: (i) sustainably increasing agricultural productivity 
to support equitable increases in incomes, food security and development; (ii) adapting and building resilience 
to climate change; and (iii) developing opportunities to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture compared with 
past trends. Activities will focus essentially on enhancing climate proofing while improving water and agriculture 
productivity. Examples of these activities are the dissemination of Systems of Rice Intensification (SRI) 
techniques, water saving technologies such as low pressure irrigation, mechanization services, improved soil 
management, urea-deep placement, drought-resistant and hybrid seed varieties, Integrated Nutrient 
Management (INM), Integrated Pest Management (IPM), organic farming techniques, and diversification into 
high value crops such as pulses and millets, vegetables and other horticulture crops. The project will provide 
farmers with training and technical assistance. A grant facility will finance small equipment, inputs, services 
and/or activities to: (i) promote the adoption of priority technologies, (ii) strengthen producer-based 
organizations, transfer knowledge and technologies; (iii) improve food safety and quality standards, and (iv) 
improve handling, packaging and post-harvest management at the farm level. This sub-component may qualify

Subcomponent 3b: Agribusiness and linking farmers to market – This subcomponent will focus on value 
addition and forward linking farmers to markets under a productive alliance approach. Productive alliances are 
collaborative arrangement between groups or producer organizations (POs) and an agribusiness within 
particular value-chains for provision in a specified quantity, quality and time.  Four elements define the nature 
of a Productive Alliance (PA), namely: a group of organized producers, a buyer, an investment in production and 
marketing, and technical assistance. The project will finance outreach and promotional activities to identify POs, 
commercial partners and private financing entities to form alliances, and formulate business proposals and 
business plans. In order to become eligible for financing under the project, a business plan will have to be 
financially feasible, and support one or more productive alliances. Grants would be that portion of the alliance’s 
business plan that would be: (i) financed with proceeds from the proposed project; (ii) implemented by POs; (iii) 
governed by agreements signed between the PO and the project; and (iv) include fixed capital (e.g., plant and 
equipment, minor infrastructure), working capital and technical assistance expenditures. Examples of business 
plans to be financed could be the following: the establishment of PO managed collection, dehusking and 
processing center for rice or cereals, a sorting, grading and packaging facility for fresh vegetables, a grading and 
processing center for cashew nuts. 
 
Subcomponent 3c: Farm Service Centers – The project will finance a TA to promote a local network of private, 
retail supply and farm service businesses Farm Service Centers (FSCs) throughout the project area. An 
enterprise-based delivery of farm supplies and services, FSCs will be one-stop-shops that provide smallholder 
farmers with agricultural and veterinary inputs, services and technologies that will help production and linkages 
to markets. This highly adaptable model, has already been proven successful in several countries worldwide and 
in the region, notably in Senegal and Ethiopia. Grants will be provided and applications reviewed and ranked on 
a competitive basis to evaluate technical capacity, proposed business plan, and potential impacts.  FSCs can be 
privately owned or owned by cooperatives or other types of producers associations. In addition, this 
subcomponent will promote mechanization providing on-demand tractor services for smallholder farmers who 
are relying on expensive and often unavailable manual labor through low-cost “Smart Tractor owners” that pairs 
better off local tractors owners with labor-constrained farmers willing to pay for tractor services (tractor 
“Uberization”). A booking system will allow farmers to request, schedule and prepay for tractor services, from 
nearby Smart Tractor owners, through SMS messaging and mobile money. The subcomponent will provide 
grants, studies and consultant services. Technical inputs and knowledge sharing for this component will be 
provided (tentatively) by the Syngenta Foundation.  
 
Component 4. Implementation (US$ 10M IDA) 
 
Subcomponent 4a: Institutional Strengthening – The primary institution responsible for water resources 
development and management in the North of Cameroon is MEADEN reporting to MINEPAT. The Government 
has constituted a multi-disciplinary team to formulate this project. In order to formulate this project well and 
implement it, MEADEN staff structure has to be modified and modernized. The current organogram of MEADEN 
is being studied in detail to identify gaps and areas for strengthening in order to develop over the coming years 
a modern up to international standards MEADEN, similar to the SAED (Société Nationale d’Aménagement et 
d’Exploitation des Terres) approach in Senegal. MEADEN presently is a state-owned entreprise in charge of

irrigation service delivery as well as land allocation to farmers and land preparation  TORs are being prepared 
and positions will be filled based on Job Descriptions acceptable to the Bank after the approval of the PCN. 
Funds would be provided to support the training required to strengthen the skills of MEADEN staff both in the 
country, and abroad.  
The operation and maintenance of the new and rehabilitated/modernized irrigation systems would be carried 
out jointly by MEADEN and the Water Users Associations to be set up under the project. MEADEN would be 
responsible for the operation and maintenance of the primary canals and drains while the WUAs would be 
responsible for the secondary and tertiary systems. For irrigation services to be effectively delivered, WUAs will 
have to rely on a participatory design and the cooperation of all member farms, which entails paying irrigation 
and WUA membership fees, signing water contracts with WUAs and attending WUA planning meetings.  
 As several farms are headed by women, a study will be carried out during preparation to find the social 
implications for female irrigators to honor their farm’s financial obligations to WUAs, attend WUA planning 
meetings, and sign an annual contract for water delivery with the WUAs. The study will provide analyses and 
recommendations to improve land tenure rights as well for both female and male irrigators. In addition, the 
concept of WUAs is new to Cameroon. Funds would be provided to train the WUAs as well as to develop 
appropriate legislation for the creation of the WUAs (this is already on-going with the PULCI project).  
Government of Cameroon authorities undertook a study visit in January 2018 to visit the SAED  operations in 
the Senegal river’s delta, where such WUAs are operating efficiently. Following the same model, funds would 
be provided to develop similar arrangements between MEADEN and the WUAs. Irrigation infrastructure would 
be provided with required instrumentation to enable MEADEN to monitor the performance of the WUAs on a 
regular basis to ensure irrigation water is supplied to the farmers on a timely basis and agreed quantities are 
delivered. 
Subcomponent 4b: Project Implementation and M&E support – This subcomponent will set up a Project 

Management Unit (PMU) to assist MEADEN in the day-to-day implementation of the project. Proposed structure 

of the PMU with job descriptions will be developed and agreed with MEADEN before appraisal.  The core PMU 

will be set up in MEADEN soon after the PCN approval. Funds would be provided to meet salaries and allowances 

of PMU staff and to cover operation expenses. The GoC expressed interest in requesting a Project Advance. 

These funds will be used among other things to make progress in setting up and strengthen the PMU 

accordingly. In addition, baseline information will be collected before the start of the management of the 

watershed and before the starting of the production activities in the area to allow an impact evaluation at the 

end of the project life. 

 
 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The project is located in the Sudano-sahelian zone of Cameroon, it is presumably the driest zone of the country. Rainfall 

in this zone is highly variable with its onset very erratic and last for about 5 months (May-September). This zone is mostly 
affected by land degradation. Land disputes and agropastoral conflicts are of a major concern because there are no

defined routes for cattle migration, and thus animals. Land degradation is due to pressures such as deforestation due to 
expanding agriculture, fuel wood harvesting, bush fires, semi-intensive and extensive cattle rearing and farming. National 
Park belongs to this zone and it is home to elephants, black rhinos, cheetahs, hyenas, population of hippos and other 
wildlife. Porous borders and poor park protection make Faro extremely vulnerable to poachers, livestock, and habitat 
destruction. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
Cameroon has a comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) law and regulations as well as 

occupational safety regulations. The framework law No 96/12 of 5 August 1996 on environmental management highlights 
in its article 17 the principle of environmental impact assessment. Two forms of public participation-stakeholder 
engagement are required for ESIA by law: public consultations during the assessment stage and public hearings during the 
review stage. Legal and administrative appeals are possible at all stages and for all decisions relating to ESIA. A relatively 
mature central (Ministry of environment, interministerial Committee on the Environment, CIE decentralized 
(municipalities, Divisional Committees for technical and administrative supervision of ESMP and ministry of environment 
decentralized units) ESIA authorities are in place but they are understaffed. The CIE gives an opinion on the quality of 
reports prior to their approval by the Minister. The decentralized units don’t have adequate financial provision. They lack 
adequate equipment for fieldwork, and Senior staff lack personal vehicles. In 2017, the ESIA sub-directorate and 
Environmental & Social Management Plan (ESMP) sub-directorate in the Ministry of Environment consist of six full-time 
staff and 2-4-part time staff, of whom many are knowledgeable about the national ESIA system and the World Bank 
Safeguards for which they received a substantial training. MAEDEN is not familiar with the World Bank operational 
policies as this is its first Bank financed projects. It has an institutionalized GIS unit but does not have the necessary 
technical knowledge and expertise in environmental and social issues in the region and as such has the technical capacity 
to identify and flag any safeguards related concerns to the implementation of the safeguards instruments for national-
level investments, should any arise during project implementation. To bridge this gap, the project will set up a Project 
Management Unit (PMU) to assist MEADEN in the day-to-day implementation of the project. At the early stage of 
preparation, two safeguards specialists (Social and Environmental) will be hired for the PMU. They will oversee the 
preparation of the safeguard documents, liaise with local consultants, and coordinate the organization of the necessary 
consultations with key concerned stakeholders and the in-country disclosure of the safeguards instruments.

D. Policies that might apply 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The Project is proposed to be classified as Category 
OP/BP 4.01 “A” due to potential downstream impacts 
and negative potential environmental and social 
impacts associated with development and/or 
rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure. A basin level 
ESIA report that will include Cumulative Impact 
Assessment (CIA) will be prepared during 
implementation. However, a specific ESIA for the 



 
The World Bank  
North Cameroon Agriculture and Water Smart Landscapes Project (P166072) 

 
 

  
Jan 28, 2018 Page 21 of 25  

     

known irrigation scheme (11,000 ha) will  be prepared 
and disclosed before the decision meeting. The 
specific ESIA will include a Gender Based Violence 
assessment and occupational safety. These ESIAs will 
inform the notification to Nigeria Government by the 
GoC; ToRs of these studies are consulted upon in-
country and cleared by the Bank. For the subprojects 
to be implemented under the small grants of 
component 3, which are not identified before 
appraisal, an ESMF will be prepared and it shall 
describe the roadmap for preparing sites specific. 
Finally, a GRM will be prepared, consulted upon and 
disclosed before project effectiveness.  
  

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No  

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

Although the project is not expected to intervene in 
any critically important natural habitats, downstream 
impacts, development of irrigation infrastructure may 
affect areas requiring specific management 
considerations such wildlife migration corridors. In 
addition, this policy is triggered due to the presence of 
three cynegetic zones (Campement des éléphants, 97 
920 ha; ZIC 8 : Mayo Boulel, 35 040 ha ; ZIC 8 bis: 
Louga, 8 320 ha) in the project area of influence. 
Specific guidance will be provided to avoid significant 
conversion or degradation of rivers and the EA will 
identify and delineate areas of critical habitat and 
ensured application of the mitigation hierarchy in 
accordance with this policy for all project works. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

The project does not support commercial forest 
exploitation. However, the Massif Forest of Ouro-
Doukoudje may be affected due to the presence in the 
project area of influence. Mitigation measures are 
thus proposed as part of the ESMP. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

Major interventions are planned to enhance 
agricultural productivity and this may lead to an 
increased use of pesticides and other agrochemicals. 
An Integrated Pest Management Plan (IPMP) will be 
prepared, consulted upon and disclosed before 
appraisal. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

Previous studies in the Region revealed local 
significant heritage places such as graveyards. 
Mitigation measures will be incorporated into the 
disclosed ESMP including provisions for a detailed 
Cultural Heritage Management Plan. A comprehensive

Jan 28, 2018 Page 22 of 25  

     

chance find procedure will be prepared as part of the 
ESIA reports, embedded in the overall ESMPs, to that 
end. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 

There are no Indigenous Peoples in the project areas, 
as defined by OP/BP 4.10. 
 
  

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The client will prepare a Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) for all the entire project. The project 
through its component 2 is likely to involve land 
acquisition / involuntary resettlement and/or possible 
restrictions of access to resources and livelihoods.  
There are 3 clear distinct irrigation areas: (i) right bank 
rehabilitation (1,000 ha), (ii) right bank new area 
(5,000 ha) and (iii) left bank new area (5,000 ha). 
Therefore:  
(i)           a RAP will be prepared for the rehabilitation 
area prior to appraisal.  
(ii)          for the rest eventual new irrigation areas, the 
resettlement process is at an advanced stage. The list 
of people affected by the project (PAPs) already exists, 
PAPs have received pecuniary compensation, a PAP 
resettlement site is being developed and a Declaration 
of Public Utility (DUP) exists for the eventual new 
perimeters. The Government of Cameroon elaborated 
the list of PAPs in 2010, a total of 1442 household 
affected were recorded for 3093 properties (fields and 
boxes) as provided in the decree n°2010/3445/PM of 
December 15, 2010 relating to the compensation of 
the victims by incorporating to the private domain of 
the state lands downstream from the Lagdo 
perimeters. All this documentation is being reviewed 
and updated by a social audit that the client will 
present to the World Bank team for review and 
clearance prior to appraisal. In case, there will be new 
households settled after 2010 (after the DUP), PAPs 
will be compensated for those new assets (except 
land) prior to resettlement. In case there will be new 
constructions (houses, community infrastructures, 
etc.) different from those already compensated in 
2010 in the DUP area, PAPs will also be compensated 
for these assets prior to resettlement. It is highly 
expected social audit’s recommendations will propose 
specific measures related to assistance for 
resettlement (transportation costs coverage and 
livelihoods assistance) to all PAPs to be resettled.

Upon approval, the final RAPs of these two new zones 
(right bank new area (5,000 ha) and (iii) left bank new 
area (5,000 ha)) in Lagdo will be prepared during 
project implementation and cleared by the WB prior 
to any works commence. 
In addition, a GRM document for the project will be 
prepared and disclosed before project effectiveness. 
Finally, all subprojects under component 3 will be 
submitted to an environmental and social screening 
during the implementation stage and based on results 
this would lead to Environmental and Social Impacts 
assessments (ESIAs) or Environmental and Social 
Impacts Notice (ESIN). 
  

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

 
This policy is triggered because funds would be 
provided to make any structural modifications 
required to the dam and spillway arising out of these 
studies. In addition, the project infrastructure 
investments, including irrigation, will rely on the 
performance of this existing dam. An independent 
Panel of Experts with Dam Safety and Environmental 
and Social expertise will be hired by MEADEN in 
accordance with Dam Safety Guidelines of the World 
Bank. The panel will comprise five specialists 
(geotechnical, Hydrological, hydro-electro-mechanics, 
environmental and social). Improved Emergency 
Response Preparedness plans (ERP) would be 
prepared using up to date maps and technology.  (i) 
The draft TORs for the ERP will be ready before 
appraisal; (ii) GoC will notify Nigeria and (iii) the Bank 
will review existing dam auscultation reports, and any 
other dam safety documents including the accessible 
sections of the OM before the decision meeting. ENEO 
established in 2010 a structured CSR including 
Hygiene, safety and Environment Central Unit. It aslo 
has an environmental and social policy (ESP #42 Rev 2 
09/14) and has developed Safety and Environmental 
and social performances for its operations. However, 
the ERP and ESIA processes will assess the technical 
capacity of ENEO at Lagdo Dam and Regional levels to 
identify, flag and manage any safety, environmental 
and social related concerns to the Lagdo dam 
operation – power generation, irrigation releases, 
flood releases, and safety of the dam.

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 

This policy is triggered because the Benue river  flows 
over the Nigeria–Cameroon border, and the 
Government of Cameroon (GoC) will notify Nigeria 
before negotiations. There is a memorandum of 
understanding on the need to maintain water in the 
Benue Basin was signed between Cameroon and 
Nigeria in 2016. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No There are no disputed areas in the project areas. 

 
E. Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
Tentative target date for preparing the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
Mar 28, 2018 
 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and 
their timing should be specified in the Appraisal Stage PID/ISDS 
 
In the previous stages PID/ISDS, the documents to be presented will be: 1) Resettlement Policy Framework for the whole 

project and 2) Resettlement Action Plan and list of PAPs of the area  to be rehabilitated(1000ha). The other RAPs will be 
prepared under project implementation.   
GRM document for the project need to be prepared and disclosed before project approval.  
 Consultants in charge of safeguard should be on board prior project appraisal, for insuring consultation and validation of 

safeguards instruments.

A. Introduction and Context 
 
1. Burkina Faso (274,000 km2) is a landlocked, low-income country with high demographic growth and poverty 
levels. With a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of US$610 in 2017, Burkina Faso is amongst the 20 poorest 
countries in the world. The population of about 19.6 million (2017) is young (46 percent under 15), with high growth 
rate (3 percent) and the majority (70 percent) lives in rural areas. Poverty continues to be overwhelmingly concentrated 
in rural areas, which are home to 90 percent of the poor. The country was ranked 185 out of 188 countries on the 2015 
overall UN Human Development Index (HDI). Non-income indicators of poverty and welfare, particularly in the areas of 
education and health, are among the lowest in the world, and most of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
appear out of reach.   
 
2. Economic performance has been relatively strong in the past decade; but growth has levelled off recently. 
Over the past fifteen years, economic growth has averaged about 5.5 percent per year (IMF, 2018). Burkina Faso’s 
economy is still heavily reliant on agriculture (especially cotton) and mining (especially gold), which contribute the bulk 
of its export revenues. The recent fluctuation in gold and cotton prices, combined with drops in grain production and 
political instability, have contributed to the slowdown in economic growth. The country has made progress in 
implementing structural reforms, sound economic policies, increased cotton and mining production, steady 
investments, and a stable macroeconomic environment. Monetary and exchange rate policy has been well-managed, 
and inflation has been kept at a low level (less than 3 percent over the past decade and 0.4 percent in 2017).  Burkina 
Faso has a relatively healthy banking sector. The country is also working toward an integrated and open regional 
economic space through the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), the Economic Community of West 
African States (ECOWAS), and other African cooperation initiatives notably the Africa Food Security Leadership Dialogue 
on Adapting African Agriculture to Climate Change in support of the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development 
Program (CAADP) Food Security Commitment.  In 2017, the country was ranked 74 in the world, one of the best rankings 
in Sub-Saharan Africa, according to the Corruption Perception Index. 
 
3. The country faces many socio-political and security challenges which have impeded a full economic recovery; 
the harsh climate and environment degradation are making these challenges even more acute. Burkina Faso has 
recently experienced internal unrest fueled by the unequal distribution of resources and a perceived lack of 
accountability in the management of public resources. This situation has been exacerbated by insecurity in neighboring 
Mali, and the Sahel region in general. Burkina Faso hosts more than 25,000 Malian refugees. The security situation has 
worsened significantly since June 2018 due to an upsurge in violent attacks by terrorists and criminal groups in the 
Eastern and Northern regions. If not addressed adequately, security challenges are expected to continue to impact the 
country's socioeconomic prospects in the years to come.  The harsh climatic conditions which hinder efforts to reduce 
vulnerability and extreme poverty are compounding the security challenges. 
 
4. To confront these challenges, the Government is implementing the National Program for Economic and Social 
Development (Plan National de Développement Economique et Social – PNDES). The PNDES lays out the Government’s 
vision and action plan for the period 2016-2020. It emphasizes the structural transformation of the economy with 
agriculture playing the key role as a driver of growth. Its priority interventions are to increase productivity, improve the 
management of water resources for agriculture, develop market infrastructure and support institutional 
transformation. It also highlights the challenges related to climate change and the degradation of soils, with the 
objective to support a transition towards a green economy and the sustainable management of natural resources.

B. Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
5. Burkina Faso’s agriculture sector is still one of the main pillars of the national economy, although its 
contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has decreased recently. Farming and livestock activities still occupy 
about 86 percent of Burkina Faso’s workforce and constitute the main source of income for the poorest populations. 
The sector’s contribution to GDP, however, has declined from 35 percent in 1999 to 32.6 percent in 2013 (FAOSTAT, 
2014), due to the diversification of the economy into areas such as mining. Most crops including cereals (millet, 
sorghum, maize and other cereals including coarse/feed grains), and commercial crops (mainly cotton), as well as 
legumes (cowpeas, groundnuts) are produced under rainfed conditions with low yields, with high vulnerability to 
climate change. As part of the traditional Sahelian parkland landscape, those crops often are produced in systems that 
also include useful trees, such as shea, baobab, locust-bean trees and others. Other crops, including rice, onions, 
tomatoes, and other horticultural crops, are cultivated under full irrigated (full water control) or semi-irrigated 
(bottomland) conditions. The yields of irrigated crops are also still below potential. An extended household may farm 
around 9.6 hectares (24 acres) in total, but plot sizes are small, with each plot averaging only 0.4 hectares, producing 
mostly for household consumption with little marketable surplus1. The production of food/ feed grains, of which by-
products are used for animal feeding (e.g., shredded millet/corn stalks), is common and remains the customary crop-
livestock mixed production model.  
 
6. Agriculture faces difficult agro-ecological conditions which are getting harsher due to climate change and 
increasing human pressure, leading to a situation where vulnerability and food insecurity remain key issues.  Along 
the Southern edge of the Sahelian band, the country faces the arid to semi-arid climate typical of the region. The rainfall 
is low overall (400 mm per year average in the Sahelian zone and 800-1000 mm in the Sudano-Sahelian zone), irregular 
and poorly distributed; and it is experiencing a downward trend. Some estimates indicate that more than 3.5 million 
people, roughly 20 percent of the population, are food insecure and/or suffer from inadequate nutrition. Like in much 
of the Sahel region, the increase of the population is both an asset and a challenge for agriculture, as demand for food 
increases and the needs for proper nutrition and food security must be addressed. The country’s rural areas are 
experiencing changes in land occupation patterns, with many former pastoralists becoming sedentary farmers and 
growing crops but also retaining roaming livestock herds. Therefore, pressure on land has increased, and there are 
increasing conflicts between pastoralists and farmers.  As a result, improved land management practices are 
increasingly required to secure land tenure, to optimize crop yields and to conserve land as a viable resource for the 
long run, including maintaining the carbon sequestered in the soil and landscape. 
 
7. The transport sector in Burkina Faso suffers from numerous constraints which hinder economic development, 
reducing the competitiveness of the tradable sectors of the economy including agriculture production. The state of 
transport infrastructure is poor, and the provision of transport services, hampered by road blocks and poor 
management, remains inefficient. The rural roads network is not sufficiently dense to permit access to all potential 
agriculture production areas. Key production areas remain enclaved, especially since many roads are not passable by 
regular vehicles during the rainy season. This is a major constraint to both providing the required production inputs at 
farm-gate and accessing market outlets to dispose of marketable production.   
 
8. Burkina Faso has substantial assets to develop its agriculture, both on the supply and demand side: 

i. On the supply side: (i) substantial land and agro-ecological potential, yet unexploited, offers opportunities to develop 
diversified agriculture systems; the country is endowed with 9 million ha of farmland, of which less than one-half (46 
percent) is currently under cultivation; (ii) traditional know-how and good experience of producers in certain 
production systems (flood recession cultivation, livestock fattening, poultry production, collection of agroforestry

products) and existence of many technological packages ready to be disseminated and applied; and (iii) substantial 
potential for irrigated farming using ponds and rivers, as well as underground water; and 

ii. On the demand side, agriculture development is spurred by: (i) a sizable and increasing domestic demand for food, 
particularly processed food, in tune with the nutrition needs of a rapidly increasing population overall, and with 
changing consumer preferences shifting towards greater diversification of diets and more value being attributed to 
convenience and quality; and (ii) the increasing demand for key export commodities (horticultural crops, shea nuts, 
cattle/meat) on regional and international markets. 

9. To transform its agriculture, Burkina Faso needs to address key constraints: 
a. Regulatory and institutional constraints: the legal texts governing the sector’s regulatory 

framework are not always adequate, and those existing are often insufficiently used or 
enforced2, and the means and capacity of intervention of the State services are limited, 
including planning and programming, statistical services, monitoring and evaluation, and 
information systems; 

b. Weakness of extension services: there are limited agriculture extension and outreach 
services to disseminate innovations, with consequent low expertise of producers and other 
operators in the value chains;  

c. Limited access to irrigation water resources and improved inputs: There is insufficient access 
to irrigation water resources (both through gravity and pumping) and improved inputs 
(fertilizers, phytosanitary inputs, mechanized implements, feed supplies, certified seeds, 
etc.); 

d. Poor management of natural resources: both climate change and anthropic pressure are 
leading to widespread land degradation. About 170,000 hectares per year of natural 
vegetation are lost because of land degradation and deforestation. At the current pace, 
Burkina Faso will lose approximately 15 percent of its agricultural land within 10 years; 

e. Limited competitiveness and weak connection to markets: poor public infrastructure, and 
insufficient private investment for production, processing, storage, transport and 
marketing, as well as the low valorization of by-products, insufficient market information 
and capacity to adhere to commercial norms and standards, and the low degree of 
organization of sector actors, all contribute to marketing inefficiencies; and 

f. Limited access to financing: commercial banks and micro-finance institutions, are reluctant 
to lend to agriculture given the high level of risk involved in the sector. 

 
 

10. Despite a large potential, irrigation remains underdeveloped and underexploited; tapping irrigation water 
resources is crucial to improve agricultural performance. Despite low and erratic rainfall, Burkina Faso enjoys relatively 
abundant water resources, with current agricultural withdrawals for irrigation representing a fraction of total renewable 
water resources and annual recharge. Irrigation development, in the context of erratic weather conditions currently 
amplified by climate change, has the potential to increase the resilience and productivity of the agriculture sector. 
Moving from rainfed crops to irrigated crops, as possibly feasible, is the strategy emphasized by PNDES for the 
agriculture sector. The irrigation sector in Burkina Faso, like in most Sahelian countries has experienced different stages 
of development. Following the limited success of the large-scale public irrigation schemes in the 1980s, institutional 
reforms refocused the role of public irrigation companies on irrigation development, with partial management transfer 
to water users’ associations. This has required that the management (operation and maintenance) of the irrigation

2 This is the case of the recently enacted Agriculture Investment Code (2018).

systems be carried out by institutions equipped with the necessary technical/ managerial capacity, with enough 
autonomy and flexibility, and with accountability to both the Government and users. In this respect, the project will 
provide support to Water User Associations (WUAs) so that they play an effective role in water management. 
 
11. There is large untapped potential for the development of Burkina Faso´s agro-industrial sector; but currently 
the country’s agro-processing base is weak. Only about 12 percent of agriculture commodities are processed before 
being sold on the market3. Many bottlenecks in the various value chains limit value addition, such as lack of conditioning 
or processing units. Linkages between farmers and downstream industrial and market operators are weak. Despite 
these constraints, agri-food systems are quickly changing in Burkina Faso like many other Sub-Saharan Africa countries, 
in response to changing demographic patterns coupled with economic growth. Fast-increasing population, urbanization 
trends and income growth are changing food demand in unprecedented ways, with large increases in total quantities 
demanded, growing preference for convenience, diversification of diets towards more fresh products, and an increased 
demand for product quality4. Food demand is growing particularly for items that are more processed, increasingly 
purchased on the market (instead of grown for self-consumption) and perishable (i.e., meat, dairy and fresh produce). 
A small but growing middle class already spends a significant fraction of its income on processed food. Demand for 
processed foods is thus expected to grow in Burkina Faso and neighboring countries, leading to sizable market 
opportunities for increased value addition through agro-processing. 
 
12. The weak enabling environment and limited access to commercial credit are major constraints for agriculture 
and agribusiness development. The 2017 World Bank Group Enabling the Business of Agriculture (EBA) report shows 
that Burkina Faso’s regulatory framework is impeding private investment in agriculture and agribusiness, all along the 
value chain. Significant weaknesses have been identified in regulations related to seed, fertilizer, agricultural machinery, 
water and market access. Public services, as well as professional organizations, need to be strengthened to address 
these weaknesses. Regarding credit, the agriculture sector receives only eight percent of commercial bank lending (of 
which 4.2 percent is for financing cotton) and fifteen percent of lending by Micro-Finance Institutions (MFIs). Access to 
finance by smallholder farmers is constrained by the following factors: low degree of organization of the value chains 
(except cotton), lack of bankable projects, limited exposure to financial entities, and lack of acceptable collateral. In 
addition, there are very few financial products whose terms and conditions would be adapted to the seasonal 
production cycles. Credit is mainly earmarked for production and trading of agricultural products, but very limited for 
agro-processing activities. The fact that agriculture is exposed to significant weather shocks increases the volatility of 
revenues and the risk due to drought, and hence the attendant risk faced by banks. The development of irrigation under 
the project, with provision of irrigation water year-round, will lessen this risk. This is important in the context of Burkina 
Faso where the use of suitable risk management instruments is lacking. 
 
13. Agriculture institutions exhibit major weaknesses. The primary institution in charge of crop production and 
irrigation development in Burkina Faso is the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Hydraulics (MAAH). MAAH carries out its 
operations through five core directorates dedicated to irrigation (Direction Générale des Aménagements of Hydo-
Agricoles et du Development de l ’Irrigation - DGAHDI), agricultural extension (DGPV), rural economy and sanitary & 
phyto-sanitary control (DGPER), land tenure and producer organizations (DGFOMR), and Monitoring & Evaluation and 
statistics (DGESS).  MAAH field operations are implemented through a network of decentralized branches including 
regional and provincial directorates, and regional technical support units. MAAH’s other decentralized institutions of 

                                                           
3 The PNDES target for processing of agricultural products is 25 percent.  An example of a product which is insufficiently processed is shea 
nut: 70 percent of the shea fruits are exported unprocessed. The loss of added value is estimated at US$100 million per year.

MAAH include seed production units, rural promotion centers, and regional laboratories for seed quality control. The 
following other ministries share responsibilities for agriculture in different areas: (i) the Ministry of Infrastructure (MI) 
for rural roads and tracks, (ii) the Ministry of Environment, Green Economy and Climate Change (MEEVCC) for 
environmental matters, including management of non-timber forest products and productive parklands such as shea 
parks, and (iii) the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Handicrafts for the promotion of Small and Medium Enterprises 
(SMEs), agro-processing and trade. There are other specialized semi-autonomous structures attached to MAAH with 
responsibility for specific interventions, as well as several private, consular or non-profit institutions active in agriculture 
such as the network of chambers of agriculture (Reseau des Chambres Agricoles - RECA) which provides general support 
to its private membership, the Maison de l’Entreprise which supports SMEs. The above institutions represent a fairly 
comprehensive set-up with good potential as framework to support agriculture development. However, as a general 
rule, most of these institutions display major weaknesses which prevent them from being fully effective, including 
insufficiently skilled staff and weak managerial and technical capabilities. This situation is compounded by limited 
operating budgets and/ or insufficient financial support from stakeholders and membership, lack of office and technical 
equipment, poor working conditions including office buildings which need renovation or upgrade. 
 
14. Gender gaps persist in Burkina Faso, particularly in farming activities. In the 2016 Human Development Report, 
the country ranked 146th out of 149 countries in gender inequality owing to gender disparities in a number of socio-
economic aspects. Female-headed households have 14 percent lower per capita food consumption and are more food 
insecure than male-headed households.5 Women's access to agricultural extension services, credit and productive 
resources such as agricultural inputs and equipment remains limited. Agriculture plots managed by women produce 
less per hectare than plots managed by men. The primary factors that contribute to the gender productivity gap in 
agriculture in Burkina Faso are essentially three fold: (i) women face constraints because of their duties in two economic 
spheres: the productive and the reproductive tasks in the household; (ii) women have limited access to farm labor, 
particularly male farm labor; and (iii) their productivity is limited by weak access to credit for agricultural inputs, 
improved farming equipment and labor.  

 
15. Youth unemployment is acute; it undermines the political and economic stability of the country. Rural youth 
(18 to 35 years) face challenges similar to those faced by women producers. They are mostly un-educated and lack 
professional qualifications. Their low social status and the difficulties they encounter to access economic resources limit 
their participation in productive activities.  In Burkina Faso, 68 percent of the population is under 24 years of age6. The 
problem of youth unemployment is severe: in 2014, 25.2 percent of youth were unemployed7. Given the lack of job 
opportunities, particularly in rural areas, youth unemployment threatens to undermine the country’s political stability, 
particularly within the present context of the influence of religious and other forms of extremism8. Hence, to avoid the 
instability and violence currently experienced by Burkina Faso, the focus should be on providing economic opportunities 
for young people. The focus on youth requires a gender perspective to develop effective and well targeted programs. 
Unless young women receive adequate training and have prospects of steady employment, the possibility of higher 
birth rates will undermine the country’s economic gains. Similarly, technical training and the creation of viable jobs for 
young men, in the agriculture sector particularly, is a precondition for sustainable development and peace. Ensuring 
that Burkina Faso’s youth are directly empowered with income earning activities, have access to education and training 
opportunities, and a voice in local decision-making is critical for the country’s stability and sustainable development.

a)  

 
D. Project Description  

 
19. The proposed project with a total cost of US$259.6 million will be structured as an Investment 
Project Financing (IPF) implemented over a period of six years. It will be funded by (i) two IDA credits for 
a total amount of US$200 million - a regular IDA credit of US$50 million and a Scale Up Facility (SUF) of 
US$150 million, (ii) a GoBF contribution of US$13.0 million, (iii) beneficiary contributions for US$29.4 
million, and (iv) Partner Financial Institutions (PFIs) credit of US$17.2 million. The project has three 
technical components structured around three core activity clusters: raising productivity in irrigated 
production systems; improving competitiveness and linking farmers to markets; and promoting private 
sector-led agribusiness development. A fourth component will cover project coordination activities 
capacity strengthening as well as establishment of a Contingent Emergency Response Component (CERC).  

COMPONENT 1 – ENHANCING AGRICULTURE PRODUCTIVITY (US$108.9 million of which US$97.2 million 

IDA and US$11.7 million GoBF) 

20. Component 1 aims to remove constraints to farm productivity, mainly in irrigated production 
systems. It will have three sub-components: (i) irrigation development, including attendant land-tenure 
arrangements and support to the input supply chain; (ii) agriculture advisory services; and (iii) support to 
producer groups. The project will mainstream gender and youth dimensions in all its activities, giving them 
preferential treatment particularly in project-provided agriculture training and services, as well as funding 

                                                           
9 Agribusiness entrepreneurs are defined as economic operators intervening both at production level as well as downstream of 
production, i.e. post-harvest, storage, processing and marketing including input suppliers and service providers.

of investment initiatives. This will be achieved by targeting economic activities in which women and youth 
predominate.  

21. Sub-Component 1.1: Irrigation infrastructure and land tenure (US$86.7 million of which US$75.0 
million IDA and US$11.7 million GoBF). Sub-Component 1.1 aims at supporting productive land 
development by increasing the provision of irrigation water and securing land tenure on project sites. 
Irrigation infrastructure will focus on both rehabilitation and development of irrigated perimeters. 
Emphasis will be placed on climate-proof design and construction to ensure efficiency and climate 
resilience. Sub Component (SC)1.1 will be implemented in close liaison with the Bank-financed PARIIS 
project (FY17). 

22. Irrigation development and rehabilitation. This activity will consist in rehabilitating and 
developing the irrigation and drainage infrastructure on five selected sites the project area (see annex 2, 
appendix 1), and supporting the attendant collective institutional and organization arrangements. 
Irrigation infrastructure works will cover a total of 4,497 ha over five collective irrigation schemes to be 
either fully developed (2,947 ha) or upgraded/ rehabilitated (1,550 ha), for both smallholders and 
agriculture entrepreneurs10. The project will not finance activities related to construction and/or 
rehabilitation of dams.   

23. Land tenure. The project will support arrangements to ensure proper rights to cultivate for 
farmers benefiting from irrigated land allocation, and due compensation (to be funded by the GoBF) for 
those who will lose their lands or income losses in the process of land reallocation. It will support MAAH’s 
dedicated land tenure services (DGFOMR) at the central level and in the seven communes adjacent to the 
project irrigated perimeters. Secure land tenure will also incentivize the adoption of new technology to 
increase productivity and climate-smart practices to provide adaptation and mitigation co-benefits.  

24. Sub-Component (SC) 1.2: Agriculture advisory services (US$4.1 million IDA). Sub-Component 1.2 
aims to improve the delivery of advisory and outreach services, with a focus on extension activities 
regarding more productive and sustainable agricultural practices under irrigation conditions. This will be 
achieved by providing catalytic support towards strengthening the capacity of MAAH’s services 
(Directorate General for Agricultural Extension, DGPV) and other relevant institutions dedicated to 
delivering demand-driven agri-food-oriented extension and outreach services. In doing so, the project will 
scale up results achieved by the WAAPP project to enable a wider adoption of Good Agriculture Practices 
(GAPs). This Sub-Component will provide funding for the following activities inter alia: (i) preparation of 
specialized extension guides and provision of training regarding different Good Agriculture Practices GAP), 
e.g., the use of the Farmer Field School (FFS) approach, Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) techniques 
(including bio-compost), Integrated Pest Management (IPM), System of Rice Intensification (SRI) and/or 
gender-oriented practices; (ii) capacity building and dissemination of the related knowledge regarding 
production and certification of improved seeds and planting material; (iii) development of an e-extension 
platform, using digital solutions and applications to modernize and increase the outreach of advisory 
services; (iv) training for DGPV staff through participation in specialized forums, provision of scholarships 
for diploma courses in selected fields, organization of exchange trips, etc. SC1.2 will also finance 
investments to support extension services such as office rehabilitation and equipment (including 
computer equipment), technical equipment and vehicles for DGPV and its communal offices in the project 

                                                           
10 Smallholders will be allocated plots of 0.5 or 1.0 ha each for a total of 3,497 ha, and agricultural entrepreneurs tracks of land of at 
least 10 to a maximum of 50 ha each for a total of 1000 ha.  NB. The project will also develop, in the form of individual investment sub-
projects under Component 3 private sites intended for arboriculture, for a total of 1,000 ha under small irrigation systems (pumping, 
Californian, drip, and solar powered irrigation systems that reduce energy use, etc.)

areas. 

25. Sub-Component (SC) 1.3: Support to producer organizations and input supply (US$18.1 million 
IDA). Sub-Component 1.3 has a two-pronged objective: (i) to strengthen and/or facilitate the creation of 
Agricultural Producer Organizations (OPAs), including economic interest groups, and cooperative societies 
of different types, and (ii) to facilitate the supply of inputs required for targeted crops. Objective (i) will 
be achieved through MAAH’s dedicated services (DGFOMR)11, as well as the assistance of specialized non-
government organizations (NGOs) or service providers. SC1.3 will place special emphasis on developing 
Water Users Associations (WUAs) to strengthen water management. Strengthened institutional and 
organizational arrangements will allow farmers to have greater participation in decisions, leading to more 
sustainable water use and more equitable sharing of the benefits. This will also contribute to enhance 
resilience through promoting a stronger sense of ownership, and greater efficiency and accountability, in 
water use and land development. Under objective (ii), input supply to farmers will include the provision 
of the required means of production to develop cropping systems on irrigated land. This will follow the 
technical guidance of extension services received under Sub-Component 1.2. The project will make 
available to smallholder farmers the package of inputs, improved seeds and small implements through 
the current national programs for a period of two years under the same subsidy conditions as those 
granted under these programs.   

COMPONENT 2 – IMPROVING COMPETITIVENESS AND FOSTERING MARKET ACCESS (US$34.6 million of 

which US$33.7 million IDA and US$0.9 million GoBF) 

26. Component 2 aims to improve competitiveness and foster access to markets through three sub-
components aimed at (i) capacity building of MAAH central directorates regarding sanitary and phyto-
sanitary control, development of quality norms and standards, and support to market knowledge; (ii) the 
provision of marketing facilities; and (iii) construction/ rehabilitation of rural road infrastructure. 

27. Sub-Component (SC) 2.1: Sanitary and phyto-sanitary control, development of quality norms 
and standards, and support to market knowledge (US$5.2 million IDA). Sub Component 2.1 will focus, 
firstly, with regard to sanitary and phyto-sanitary control, on the regulatory framework to ensure that 
appropriate food safety regulations and means are in place to enable the country to serve the needs of 
the agriculture domestic and export markets. To that end, it will provide support to MAAH’s dedicated 
services (DGPV), including its decentralized phyto-sanitary control posts in the project area. Capacity 
building will focus on specialized areas such as food safety analysis and control. The project will also 
provide funding for logistical support and equipment of the Laboratory for Agri-food Analysis (LAPA) (e.g. 
for control of aflatoxin in maize, pesticide content in agricultural products, herbicide control, etc.) and for 
the rehabilitation of the two regional laboratories for seed control in the project area. Concerning the 
shea sector, the project will support the Institute for Research in Applied Science and Technology (IRSAT) 
for the definition of semi-industrial technological packages to reduce energy (fuelwood) consumption. 
Secondly, with regard to the promotion of the quality of agricultural products, the project will focus on 
the technical norms and trading labels so that they conform to international standards (HACCP, ISO and 
others).  To this end, it will provide training and technical assistance to MAAH’s dedicated services 
(DGPER). For the shea butter value chain, the support will aim at developing a national standard of 
production to ensure quality consistency along the chain. Thirdly, in terms of market knowledge, the 

                                                           
11 Regarding the shea nut value chain and other carbon-related activities, support to producer organizations (TFK) and biodigester 
compost suppliers will be done through the dedicated services of the Ministry of Environment, Green Economy and Climate Change 
(DGEVCC)

project will finance the collection of market information regarding the project-supported commodities. It 
will support the strengthening of MAAH’s Agricultural Market Information System (SIMA), including data 
collection on specific targeted markets. Information and awareness workshops on SIMA will be organized 
throughout the project area, including radio broadcasts, so that potential users are aware of SIMA 
existence and know how to access it. MAAH’s dedicated services (DGPER), as well as the Network of 
Chambers of Agriculture (RECA) will be supported so that they can contribute to SIMA data collection and 
diffusion efforts.  

28. Sub-Component (SC)2.2: Marketing infrastructure (US$7.2 million IDA). SC2.2 aims to strengthen 
the link between producers, off-takers and processors to ease access to market outlets. The project will 
support marketing and storage infrastructure, essentially the construction/ rehabilitation of sixteen 
purchasing counters (PCs), as well as 117 small storage facilities in strategic areas in the four regions 
covered by the project.  PCs are marketing platforms, the purpose of which is to avoid direct field 
purchases from farmers and reduce asymmetric information that expose producers to buyer pressures. 
PCs will meet the required criteria of relevance, viability, cost-effectiveness, as well as job creation, 
especially for women and youth. Attention will be paid to the management and maintenance of these 
counters in collaboration with the end-users and local authorities (see Annex 2, Appendix 3). 

29. Sub-Component (SC)2.3: Rural tracks and roads (US$22.2 million of which US$21.3 million IDA 
and US$0.9 million GoBF). SC2.3 aims to reinforce the connection of producing areas targeted by the 
project with the supply sources for productive inputs and market outlets for commodities produced. It 
will include the construction and rehabilitation of rural roads and tracks to ensure all-weather access 
throughout the year to all the project-targeted irrigated areas. A total length of about 344 km of tracks 
and road sections have been selected in concert between MAAH and the Ministry of Infrastructure (MI). 
SC2.3 will finance the technical, socio-economic and environmental studies, road works, as well as 
maintenance over a period of two years. The implementation of SC2.3 will be carried out under MI’s 
supervision through its Directorate General of Rural Tracks (DGPR). The execution of road works will be 
entrusted to private civil engineering companies, and/ or projects as part of their interventions in the 
producing areas targeted. Attention will be paid to the planning and maintenance of tracks and roads 
using national norms.  SC2.3 will provide technical assistance and training to DGPR, its decentralized 
structures and local communities involved in the project area as required to oversee the construction and 
maintenance of the project rural roads and tracks. 

COMPONENT 3: PROMOTING PRIVATE SECTOR-LED AGRIBUSINESS DEVELOPMENT (US$89.5 million of 

which US$42.9 million IDA, US$29.4 million beneficiaries and US$17.2 million PFIs) 

30. Private sector development is the major thrust of the project strategy for developing value chain 
activities. Accordingly, Component 3’s objective is to enable the country’s private agriculture and agro-
processing sector to become more competitive on domestic and external markets, by helping producers, 
processors and off-takers/ traders develop and finance their investment initiatives. Component 3’s 
activities will have a two-pronged focus on: (i) the development of business plans; and (ii) the provision 
of investment financing under the project’s Cost-Sharing Facility (CSF) for project-supported crop 
production, value addition and commercialization.  

31. Sub-Component (SC)3.1: Development of business plans (US$4.5 million IDA). The objective of 
this sub-component is to support eligible beneficiaries in developing business plans which can be eligible 
for funding under the project Cost Sharing Facility (CSF). It will assist eligible value chain operators to (i) 
identify potential investment activities aligned with the project’s objectives, (ii) select potential partners

Burkina Faso Agriculture Resilience and Competitiveness Project (P167945) 

 

 

  
 Page 13 of 27  

 

with whom they can establish partnerships; and (iii) develop viable business plans to secure access to 
project funding; these business plans will include the required specifications to conform to the eligibility 
criteria for the CSF, including the fiduciary and safeguards aspects. The above support will be provided 
through technical assistance (TA). The TA providers terms of reference will include organization of 
sensitization campaigns to inform potentially interested operators, support for the development of 
investment sub-projects eligible for CSF funding, training as needed and assistance for the beneficiaries’ 
selection process and subsequent implementation of the selected sub-projects. 

32. Sub-Component (SC)3.2: Private investment financing (US$85.0 million of which US$38.4 million 
IDA, US$29.4 million beneficiaries and US$17.2 million PFIs). This sub-component will address the 
financing constraints of the agribusiness sector by improving access to finance. It will fund a Cost Sharing 
Facility (CSF) to provide partial support to agriculture and agri-business operators in the form of Matching 
Grants (MGs) to finance their investment Sub-Projects (SPs). The MG mechanism will target (i) individual 
smallholder producers, Agriculture Producer Organizations (OPAs), cooperatives, and Small and Medium 
Enterprises (SMEs) that need financing to create, upgrade and/ or modernize their production, storage 
and processing facilities, as well as (ii) all other private sector players and entrepreneurs involved in the 
targeted agriculture value chain (e.g. traders, transporters, equipment manufacturers, service providers, 
compost providers) with similar needs. MGs will be provided under two windows, for micro and medium/ 
large sub-projects respectively, under different terms and conditions with the MG representing between 
30 to 80 percent of eligible costs. PFIs will provide a minimum of 15 to 35 percent of sub-project funding, 
except for micro sub-projects which will not require supplementary PFI funding.  In partnership with the 
DGEVCC, all MG proposals will be assessed through an ex-ante calculation on the carbon impact and the 
most effective projects may be supported to access carbon finance12. Women and youth (18 to 35 years)13, 
will receive special treatment, especially as regard their very small and/ or start-up enterprises; their 
personal contribution requirement to the funding of sub-projects will be lower than for their male and 
adult counterparts. The initial permanent working capital requirements will be eligible for MG funding. 
The funds will be disbursed directly on behalf of the beneficiary from the project account to a dedicated 
account for SP implementation opened with the PFI. The beneficiary will have the fiduciary responsibility 
regarding the use of the funds. The eligibility and selection criteria of the beneficiaries, as well as 
procedures to be followed all along the investment cycle, will be detailed in the specific project 
implementation manual (PIM) of the CSF. Goods to be funded under sub grants will be procured in 
accordance with the provisions of Financing Agreement, the PIM, the Procurement Guidelines and the 
Anti-Corruption Guidelines, and should not include any expenditures on the negative list set forth in the 
ESMF or the IPMP. 

COMPONENT 4: PROJECT COORDINATION, INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY STRENGTHENING AND 

CONTINGENT EMERGENCY RESPONSE COMPONENT (CERC) (US$26.6 million of which US26.2 million IDA 

and US$0.4 million, GoBF) 

33. Component 4 will (i) support project coordination and institutional strengthening of MAAH; and 
(ii) include a CERC.

million of which US26.2 million IDA and US$0.4 million GoBF). The Project will be managed by a Project 
Management Unit (PMU), housed within the Coordinating Unit of the Budget Program for Hydro-
Agriculture and Irrigation Development which is one of the six MAAH budget programs. Hence, the PMU 
will be integrated into the MAAH administrative structure as part of the sector-wide approach recently 
adopted by the Government under the budget programs. SC4.1 will fund (i) the establishment and 
operation of the PMU through provision of appropriate staffing and operating resources to take charge 
of project management including resources for fiduciary management, safeguard compliance, Monitoring 
and Evaluation (M&E), knowledge management and communications, and (ii) institutional capacity 
strengthening (training, equipment, office rehabilitation, etc.) for the key MAAH directorates and services, 
including their decentralized services, and the National Council for Food Security (NCFS); this will also 
include construction of an office building to host all projects under the Budget Program for Hydro-
Agriculture and Irrigation Development. To promote consultations at the grassroots, the sub-component 
will also fund a full set of Citizen Engagement activities. The general intervention principle under SC4.1 
will be to harmonize and/or pool resources with other similar externally-funded projects. In this respect, 
the PMU may share staff and operating resources with other units whenever possible to economize 
resources and take advantage of economies of scale14. 

35. Sub-Component (SC)4.2: Contingent Emergency Response Component (CERC) (US$0.0 million). 
Component 4 includes the creation of a project CERC under the oversight of the NCFS at MAAH. The CERC 
will be a mechanism to provide funding for emergencies. It will have a zero initial funding allocation. In 
the event of a crisis, the Government will be able to request the World Bank to reallocate project funds 
to the CERC to cover the costs of the emergency response and recovery. Detailed operational guidelines 
acceptable to the World Bank for implementing the project CERC activities will be prepared during the 
first six months of project implementation. All expenditures under the project’s specific CERC will be in 
accordance with World Bank OP 10 (Investment Project Financing). They will be appraised and reviewed 
in order to be acceptable to the World Bank before any disbursement is made. Disbursements will be 
made against an approved list of goods, works and services, required to support crisis mitigation, 
response, recovery and re-construction. 
 
Project Beneficiaries 
 

36. The project is expected to benefit directly and indirectly all economic agents in the project areas 
operating along the targeted value chains from production to market, including at the processing, storage, 
transport and trading stages. The total number of project beneficiaries is estimated in the order of 150,000 
individuals (see Annex 2, Appendix 4). 

37. Direct project beneficiaries are first and foremost all the smallholder crop farmers, processors, 
traders and marketers who will be involved in project-supported activities at farm-gate level and 
downstream of production. These include prominently the smallholders and entrepreneurs who will 
benefit from irrigation development, extension and subsidy for the new technology packages, and the 
project matching grants as part of project financing windows. Other direct beneficiaries will include: (i) 
the staff of MAAH agricultural extension support services and other services directly targeted by project 
activities who will receive technical support and training, and (ii) the off-takers and transporters who will 

                                                           
14 A collaboration with DGEVCC is expected for the screening of the carbon impact of the matching grants as well as the valorization of 
the project activities on the carbon market whenever they fit under one of the existing or future carbon projects developed in the 
country.

use the purchasing counters, and tracks and roads. The project will mainstream gender and youth 
dimensions in all its activities, giving them preferential treatment particularly in project-provided 
agriculture training and services, as well as funding of investment initiatives. This will be achieved by 
targeting economic activities in which women and youth predominate. These include small-scale agro-
processing activities such as mango drying, and activities in value chains dominated by women such as 
shea nut collection and processing. Youth will be targeted for any project activities focused on training to 
upgrade their skills, and activities generating jobs such as high labor intensity methods.  

38. Indirect project beneficiaries include all stakeholders who will benefit from project spillover 
effects both at national and local level, i.e., (i) at farmgate level regarding production: other crop farmers 
neither directly involved in project-supported irrigation perimeters, nor targeted by the project extension 
activities being outside the production basins; they will benefit particularly from project spillover effects 
regarding improved crop management, higher quality crop inputs and services, better defined market 
norms and standards and improved financing conditions as a result of the project; (ii) at post-harvest and 
market level: buyers and processors, value chain service providers, including private inputs providers 
(seeds, fertilizers, feed, equipment suppliers) who will benefit from overall increased supply of 
commodities produced and traded due to better roads and tracks; and (iii) on the consumption side: 
domestic consumers in Burkina Faso who will benefit from increased quantity of food and attendant 
nutritional benefits at household level. 
 

E. Implementation 
 

Institutional and Implementation Arrangements  
. 

39. The MAAH will have overall responsibility for project implementation, including management of 
environmental and social risks; it will liaise closely with the MI for implementation of rural tracks and roads 
activities, MEEVCC for the shea nut value chain development and with the Ministry in charge of Commerce, 
Industry and Handicraft (MCIA) for private sector development and agro-processing. The project’s governance 
structure will be modeled after the PARIIS project arrangements, including a Review Committee15 (RC) and a 
Project Management Unit (PMU) at the central level as well as three regional units based at MAAH’s regional 
offices and one regional unit hosted by AMVS. The RC will meet at regular intervals, at least once a year. It will be 
chaired by MAAH’s Secretary General and serve as guidance body. It will approve the Annual Work Plans and 
Budgets and progress reports. The PMU, based in Ouagadougou, will be fully mainstreamed into MAAH’s structure 
as advocated by authorities alongside other national project implementation units. It will come under MAAH’s 
Budget Program for Hydro-Agriculture and Irrigation Development which is one of the six MAAH budget programs.  

40. Details regarding PReCA’s organizational arrangements are presented in Annex 1. The PMU will sign 
partnerships or technical agreements with MAAH’s and other ministries’ directorates to carry out project activities 
within their respective mandates. The National Coordinator of the project will be de facto the head of Budget 
Program for Hydro-Agriculture and Irrigation Development as per the new decree organizing the budget 
programs16.. The National Coordinator will delegate the management function of the project to a Project Manager 

                                                           
15 The RC will include representatives of the MAAH (General Secretary-SG, Cabinet, General Directorate of Studies and Sector Statistics-
DGESS, DGPV, DGFOMR, DGPER); the Ministry of Economy and Finance (DGCOOP, DGEP, DGB); National Agriculture Chamber; Coordinators 
of projects and programs in the agriculture sector; representatives of financing partners, DCMEF/MAAH, DAF/MAAH, DGEVCC/MEEVCC  
and DMP/MAAH will also be invited to participate as observers.

who might be competitively recruited or appointed following the World Bank non-objection. His/her signature 
will be required to commit project financing. S/he will be assisted by a team of high caliber who might be 
competitively recruited or appointed, covering technical, fiduciary, social and environmental safeguard functions 
deemed critical for proper project implementation and management. As needed, some staff may be shared with 
other projects under the budget program. 

41. MAAH has been responsible over the past decade, and is still responsible currently, for implementing 
several important World Bank-funded projects. It has acquired capacity to support the different PMUs from 
technical, financial management, safeguards and M&E viewpoints. Similarly, the other ministries which will be 
involved have enough capacity to implement project activities. This is the case of MI which has managed several 
externally-funded projects related to road infrastructure. Detailed implementation arrangements will be worked 
out as part of the PIM to ensure that MAAH and other ministries maintain enough implementation capacity, 
promote complementarity and avoid overlap between the different projects under their watch. The PIM will 
compile all procedures for PReCA’s operational implementation, encompassing the administrative, fiduciary, 
M&E, procurement and social and environmental safeguards procedures. It will include detailed TORs for all PMU 
staff. Drawing on the experience of other World Bank-financed projects, specific sections of the PIM will be 
prepared for (i) the Cost Sharing Facility (CSF) and (ii) the Contingent Emergency Response Component (CERC). 

 
    
F. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 
 

Four administrative regions have been selected for project implementation in the Western part of the 
country: Douna in Léraba province, Banzon in Kénédougou Province), Dourou in Passoré province and Bissan 
and Dangoumana Mouhoun in Mouhoun province.

SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 

 

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The operation will finance the rehabilitation and 
development of irrigated perimeters. It is also 
expected the construction or rehabilitation of all-
weather rural roads to fully opening up throughout 
the year all the project-targeted producing basins. In 
addition, the project will fund the construction of 



 

The World Bank  
Burkina Faso Agriculture Resilience and Competitiveness Project (P167945) 

 

 

  
 Page 17 of 27  

 

market facilities of public interest at national and/ or 
regional level. Furthermore, the Banzon's irrigation 
scheme will be rehabilitated. Consequently, an 
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) 
was developed for that irrigated perimeter and an 
Environmental and Social Management 
Framework(ESMF) was produced for investments 
that detailed studies are not available and locations 
unknown to date. Thereafter, both instruments were 
reviewed, consulted upon and disclosed publicly. 
The ESIA was disclosed in Burkina Faso on April 4 
and at the World bank website on April 5, 2019 
while the ESMF was disclosed in Burkina on March 7 
and at the bank's website on March 27, 2019. 

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No This policy is not triggered by the project. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

Irrigation schemes are potentially known for hosting 
natural habitats, more specifically aquatic species 
habitats. However, it is not anticipated that planned 
investments will impact negatively natural 
habitats.This policy is  triggered to draw the 
attention of the Project Management Unit (PMU) 
when civil works are going to be undertaken in 
irrigation schemes areas. The ESMF prepared in line 
with the OP4.01  includes a section for a proper 
management of Natural habitats that might be 
located irrigation schemes areas. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 No 

This policy is not triggered since the Project will not 
affect forests nor forest-dependent communities, 
and the Project will also not involve or support 
changes in the management of forests. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

The project intends to support agricultural 
intensification. That may lead the producers to the 
use of chemical products such as pesticides. To 
anticipate and prevent any wrong use of pesticides 
with their adverse impacts on environment and 
communities, an Integrated Pest Management Plan 
(IPMP) was developed as a separate instrument. Like 
the ESMF, this safeguard tool once prepared, was 
reviewed, consulted upon and disclosed in Burkina 
Faso on March 7 and at the World bank website on 
March 27, 2019. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 
In order to anticipate and to be sure that all the 
precautions have been taken to protect and 
safeguard physical cultural resources, a section 



 

The World Bank  
Burkina Faso Agriculture Resilience and Competitiveness Project (P167945) 

 

 

  
 Page 18 of 27  

 

addressing these concerns has been included in the 
ESMF. This section will show how to handle chance 
finds of cultural assets within the project area. This, 
because activities related to the construction and 
rehabilitation of irrigated perimeters, feeder roads, 
markets facilities and other infrastructure works will 
induce excavations with potential discoveries of 
physical cultural resources. 

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 No 
There are no Indigenous People as defined by the 
policy in Burkina 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

The project will finance activities that could induce 
potential adverse social impacts that may lead to 
land acquisition and/or restrictions on access to 
resources and sources of income or livelihoods: 
rehabilitation and development of irrigated 
perimeters, construction or rehabilitation of all-
weather rural roads to fully opening up throughout 
the year all the project-targeted producing basins, 
construction of market facilities of public interest at 
national and/ or regional level. Furthermore, the 
Banzon's irrigation scheme will be rehabilitated. 
Consequently, a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was 
developed for that irrigated perimeter and 
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was produced 
for investments whose detailed studies are not 
available and locations unknown to date. Thereafter, 
both instruments were reviewed, consulted upon 
and disclosed publicly. The RPF was disclosed in 
Burkina on March 22 and at the Bank's website on 
March 27, 2019. As for the RAP, it was disclosed in-
country and at the bank's website on April 5, 2019.  

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

The policy is triggered because the project will 
intervene in irrigation schemes that rely on existing 
dams. The project will not have direct intervention 
on dams. The situation of existing dams is described 
as follows: 
 
Dourou dam: This dam is located upstream of 
Dourou irrigation scheme and has a capacity of 83 
Hm3 and a 10.5 m height. A review of Dourou dam 
safety conditions was commissioned by the Ministry 
of Agriculture and financed by the WBG project 
PARIIS in 2017. The report was approved by the 
Ministry and the World Bank in February 2017.  The 
remedial works related to the structural stability of 



 

The World Bank  
Burkina Faso Agriculture Resilience and Competitiveness Project (P167945) 

 

 

  
 Page 19 of 27  

 

the dam identified in this study were carried out in 
2018 under the State budget as evidenced during a 
WBG mission in November 2018. Further studies 
shall be carried out to assess the suitable  option for 
increasing the discharge capacities of the spillways. 
The hydrological risk has been identified as one of 
the most critical dam safety risks by the independent 
dam safety assessment in 2017. 
 
Mouhoun / Léry dam: Regarding the Sourou Valley 
where the project will finance the construction of 
Dangoumana and Bissan schemes, the 
Mouhoun/Léry dam (580 Hm3 / 8 m) was 
rehabilitated in 2014 through the project “Projet de 
Développement de l ’Agriculture (PDA)” financed by 
the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) with 
complementary works financed by the Government 
in 2017 and 2019. The MCA project also financed, in 
2014, a review of the Operation and Maintenance of 
the Mouhoun /Léry dam and recommended 
procedures for the O&M during the different 
seasons and in case of extreme events (floods); 
these recommendations are currently followed by 
the entity in charge of the dam operation, the 
Mouhoun Water Agency (Agence de l’Eau du 
Mouhoun). The O&M Plan should be updated along 
with a comprehensive dam safety assessment  taking 
into account the reservoir operation of the recently 
constructed  Samendéni dam in the upstream of the 
river 
 
Samendéni dam: Two hundred kilometers upstream 
Mouhoun/Léry dam, on the Mouhoun river, the 
Government of Burkina Faso has built in 2017 
another large dam, with a capacity of 1,050 Hm3 and 
a height of 23.9 m. The reservoir has been filled for 
the first time in 2018. The overall impacts of this 
dam on the WBG investments in Bissan and 
Dangoumana would be positive: (i) the dam will 
contribute to better control flood during the rainy 
season which will reduce the risks downstream and; 
(ii) the Samendéni dam will increase the flow on the 
dry season, which will increase the water availability 
for irrigation in the Sourou Valley. The independent 
dam safety assessment and preparation of dam 
safety plans; i.e.  O&M Plan covering  



 

The World Bank  
Burkina Faso Agriculture Resilience and Competitiveness Project (P167945) 

 

 

  
 Page 20 of 27  

 

Instrumentation Plan, and Emergency Preparedness 
Plans, shall be undertaken in an expeditious manner.  
 
During project implementation, dam safety risk 
assessments and dam safety plans (including O&M 
plans, Instrumentation plans and Emergency 
Preparedness Plans) will be carried out as well as 
periodic dam’s safety inspections for the Dourou 
dam, the Mouhoun/Léry dam and the Samendéni 
dam and have been included in the Financing 
Agreement as Disbursement Conditions before the 
start of irrigation schemes’s construction. If some 
additional remedial works are identified for the 
dams, the Government will finance such 
complementary remedial works or safety-related 
measures. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 

The proposed project finances the rehabilitation and 
development of irrigation schemes that will draw on 
an international waterway and its tributaries. In 
accordance with the policy, riparian countries and 
the Volta Basin Authority were notified in April 2019. 
The Volta Basin authorities and riparian countries 
expressed their no-objection to the project. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
The project coverage is not located in a Disputed 
Area. 

 
 

KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The operation will finance the rehabilitation and development of irrigation schemes. It is also expected the 
construction or rehabilitation of all-weather rural roads to fully opening up throughout the year all the project-
targeted producing basins. In addition, the project will fund the construction of market facilities of public interest at 
national and/ or regional level. Some of these infrastructures may have major environmental and social impacts. 
Irrigation investments may have adverse but limited environmental impacts on water resources, for the most part, 
and will require the resettlement of some local communities. The main environmental safeguards issues for the 
project relate to water pollution, construction waste management, water abstraction and changes to water outflows 
from the rivers and associated impacts on downstream human needs and aquatic habitats, and biodiversity. 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area: 
Irrigation investments in the project area may have a medium to long term impact on water cumulative off-takes from 
the waterways. The long-term social impact is also of importance, as agricultural development may lead to intense 



 

The World Bank  
Burkina Faso Agriculture Resilience and Competitiveness Project (P167945) 

 

 

  
 Page 21 of 27  

 

migration within the Project intervention area. Among the more beneficial potential indirect long-term impacts are 
the use of more water-saving irrigation systems and technologies. This will be further supported by sustained dialogue 
on water management in the project area and the proposed measures aimed at reducing water consumption for 
irrigation. This will include different measures and incentives to facilitate the adoption of water saving techniques, as 
well as a more transparent planning of public and private investments in the coming years. Lastly, in compliance with 
the triggering of OP7.50, a notification letter was sent to each of the other five riparian countries and the Volta Basin 
Authority (VBA).  The countries and the VBA expressed their no-objection to the project 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts. 
The rehabilitation of the irrigated perimeters and of the access roads are crucial to the achievement of the project 
objectives and they will be done with minimal effect to the environment and all precautionary measures will be taken 
to avoid causing any irreversible damage to the environment. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The project is rated as Environmental Assessment Category “A”, requiring a full environmental assessment. The 
following environmental safeguard policies are triggered: Environmental Assessment (OP/ BP 4.01); Natural habitats 
(OP/ BP.04); Dam Safety (OP/ BP 4.37); Pest Management (OP 4.09); Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12); Physical 
Cultural Resources (OP/ BP4.11) and Projects on International Waterways (OP/ BP 7.50). 
 
The project has adopted a framework approach to deal with environmental matters. This is justified since exact 
locations for a substantial number of program activities, particularly those of the sub-projects, which may have 
environmental potential adverse impact, have not yet been determined with certainty. Therefore, an Environmental 
and Social Management Framework (ESMF) has been prepared in line with OP/BP4.01. This ESMF includes specific 
chapters on Natural Habitats and Physical Cultural Resources in compliance with OP4.04, OP4.37 and OP/BP4.11 
respectively. With respect to Pest Management in line with the OP4.09 triggering, a Pest Management Plan has been 
developed as a stand-alone document. In addition to the above-mentioned documents, the Borrower has prepared an 
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for developing and expanding the Banzon irrigation scheme as 
part of project investments. Lastly, with the aim of being in full compliance with the triggering of OP7.50, a notification 
letter was sent to each of the five other members countries of Volta Authority Basin that replied positively, granting 
their agreement for the project approval. 
 
The ESMF lays out procedures for screening and mitigating impacts from construction and operation of the irrigation 
schemes, and includes the following: (a) checklists of potential environmental and social impacts and their sources; (b) 
procedures for participatory screening of proposed sites and activities and the environmental and social 
considerations; (c) procedures for assessing potential environmental and social impacts of the planned project 
activities; (d) institutional arrangements for mitigating, preventing, and managing the identified impacts; (e) typical 
environmental management planning process for addressing negative externalities in the course of project 
implementation; (f) a system for monitoring the implementation of mitigation measures; and (g) recommended 
capacity building measures for environmental planning and monitoring of project activities.  
 
The PMP encourages the use of organic fertilizers and biological technics to fight against agriculture predators. In 
addition to that, it sets up guidance and guidelines with the aim to protect population health and environment 
integrity in promoting best practices in the case of use of chemical products. 
 
The RPF document outlines the principles and procedures for resettlement and or compensation of subproject-



 

The World Bank  
Burkina Faso Agriculture Resilience and Competitiveness Project (P167945) 

 

 

  
 Page 22 of 27  

 

affected people, and establishes standards for identifying, assessing and mitigating negative impacts of program 
supported activities. In addition, the RPF will guide the preparation and implementation of RAPs for each individual 
sub project that triggers the involuntary resettlement policy. Specific ESIAs and RAPs will be prepared for relevant 
activities before project implementation along with Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs). The ESIAs 
will provide mitigation measures for all the potential impacts as a result of the triggering of the above-mentioned 
safeguard policies. 
 
In addition to these above mentioned 03 documents, the borrower has also prepared 01 ESIA and 01 RAP for Banzon’s 
irrigation scheme that was clearly identified as being part of futures investments. 
 
All of these 05 safeguard instruments have been reviewed by the banks’ specialists, consulted upon and disclosed in 
Burkina Faso and at the Bank’s website as follows. 
 
-ESMF, disclosed in Burkina Faso on March 7 and at the World bank website, on March 27, 2019.   
-PMP disclosed in Burkina Faso, on March 7 and at the World bank website on March 27, 2019.  
-RPF disclosed in Burkina Faso, on March 22 and at the World bank website on March 27, 2019.    
-ESIA disclosed in Burkina Faso on April 4, and at the World bank website, on April 5, 2019.   
-RAP disclosed in Burkina Faso and at the World bank website on April 5, 2019.   
 
The Project Management Unit (PMU) carry out the screening for all investments will determine the actions necessary 
to comply with environmental and social safeguard policies and national legislation. It will determine whether an ESIA 
and/or RAP, or both, will be required and will prepare appropriate safeguards instruments for each of the sub-
projects.  The PMU will commission the preparation of detailed ESIAs and RAPs to be carried out by independent 
consultants, based on terms of reference (TORs) to be reviewed by BUNEE and the Bank. The PMU will be responsible 
not only for the overall implementation of the PMP, ESMF, RPF and specific safeguard instruments required for 
specific Project activities (i.e. ESIAs and/or RAPs), but also for the internal monitoring of proposed mitigation 
measures. All site-specific safeguard instruments will be submitted to BUNEE for decision before submission to the 
Bank for review, clearance and disclosure in-country and on the Bank’s website. 
 
Responsibility and oversight of the Project’s overall compliance with national and Bank safeguard policies will be 
devolved to the environmental Safeguards Specialist and social Safeguards specialists within the PMU, as the main 
persons in charge of project implementation and monitoring of safeguard aspects. They will be working in close 
collaboration with BUNEE. BUNEE will not only conduct periodic monitoring of project’s compliance with proposed 
mitigation of changes, but also changes in environmental resources (i.e., water and soil quality, flora and fauna, vector 
ecology, soil erosion etc.) from the baseline. 
 
Further, all civil works, for developing or expanding irrigation schemes; construction and rehabilitation activities of 
other types of infrastructure, will be contingent on broad-based and sustained consultation with local communities in 
project’s intervention area. Mitigation measures for identified environmental and social impacts, including avoiding or 
sparing cultural and historical resources and other environmental clauses, will be properly implemented by 
contractors and sub-contractors, as specified in the safeguard instruments and bidding documents. Selected 
contractors and their Resident Engineering Teams will be required, each, to hire an environmental and social experts 
with strong skills in Occupational Health and Safety issues for the environmental specialist and Labor influx and 
Gender Based Violence (GBV) for the social specialist, whose roles are to ensure specific Environmental, Safety, Health

The BUNEE will be responsible for ensuring the Project activities are implemented in accordance with national laws 
while the World Bank’s specialists will make sure that all investments that may have potential adverse impacts are in 
full compliance with environmental and social safeguard policies triggered by the project. 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, 
with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The preparation of the safeguard documents (i.e. ESMF, PMP, RPF, ESIA and RAP) followed a broad-based and in-
depth consultation approach with and interviews of relevant stakeholder groups in the public and private sectors and 
civil society. These consultations include Producer Organizations, particularly those within or in the vicinity of the 
Project intervention area, key Ministries and Government agencies, in particular Ministries of Agriculture, Water 
resources, Environment, Health, the Plant Protection Agency, pesticides wholesalers and retailers; BUNEE, the 
national agency in charge of review and enforcement of environmental legislation and regulations; health care 
personnel and NGOs.  
 
While local populations were enthusiastic about and confirmed their interest in the proposed investments, they 
nonetheless raised a few issues that prevail in current exploitation and management practices in the project area. 
Producers and local Government representatives have requested to be fully involved in the design and 
implementation of land allocation process; fostering marketing and commercialization of agricultural produce 
domestically, as well as in the sub-region; Fostering a dynamic framework for dialogue and consensus building 
between crop producers and livestock producers, strengthened by binding laws and regulations designed to 
avoid/minimize conflicts between them; concerted efforts and synergy among sectoral agencies for environmental 
sustainability in the project intervention area. In particular, participants wished close involvement of the forestry and 
nature conservation departments in the project implementation, in order to minimize deforestation, river banks 
degradation; proliferation of water borne diseases; existence of prohibited pesticides, inadequate storage and misuse 
of pesticides; lack of opportunities of women in productive agriculture. These concerns have all been reflected in the 
safeguards documents and appropriate recommendations have been formulated.

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) reveals that Kenya?s economy is the ninth largest in Africa and 
fifth largest in Sub-Saharan Africa (after Nigeria, South Africa, Angola, and Sudan)  . Kenya?s 
growth compares favorably with other countries. It no longer lags behind its regional peers or 
other lower-middle-income countries. Average growth between 2010 and 2013 was 6.2 percent?
significantly higher than the 5.3 percent average for Sub-Saharan Africa. Kenya?s 2013 growth 
rate of 5.7 percent was above the 5.0 percent average growth rate for lower-middle income 
countries.  In December 2014, Kenya?s GDP was estimated at US$55.2 billion (up from US$44.1 
billion before rebasing), with GDP per capita standing at US$1,246 (up from US$994). Kenya is 
now a lower-middle-income country, according to the World Bank classification, with Gross 
National Income (GNI) per capita of US$1,160 in 2013.   The economy was estimated to have 
grown 5.4 percent in 2014 and expected to grow by 6 percent in 2015 on the backdrop of 
significant improvement in external and internal balances, such as falling oil prices; and public 
investment, mainly in infrastructure (energy and the standard gauge railway). The World Bank 
projects that Kenya?s GDP will grow 6.6 percent in 2016, and 7.0 percent in 2017. 
 
2. Although poverty rates in Kenya seem to have fallen, formidable challenges at reducing 
poverty and increasing shared prosperity, in particular in rural areas, remain. Poverty reduction 
has been driven by solid growth across most sectors of the economy. But improvements in 
income are not evenly shared amongst people and inequality appears to be rising among regions.  
According to the World Bank Group Kenya Country Partnership Strategy (CPS 2014-2018), 
Kenya?s poverty rate has been falling?from 47 percent in 2005/06 to about 39 percent based on 
best estimates in 2012/13. But in the remote, arid, sparsely populated north-eastern parts of the 
country (Turkana, Mandera, and Wajir), poverty rates are above 80 percent.  The scale of 
consumption poverty in Kenya is staggering, and is concentrated in rural areas. Based on the last 
national household budget survey, close to half of the population (nearly 17 million Kenyans) was 
poor in 2005. The vast majority of the poor lived in rural areas and were more likely to depend on 
income and consumption from crops and livestock, as their main source of livelihood. Revised 
poverty estimates indicate that in 2013 nearly 4 in 10 Kenyans continue to live in extreme 
poverty.  
 
3. As the roles of national and county governments are restructured, and new county 
institutions are created, a fundamental challenge is to maintain the delivery of agricultural 
services. Under the new constitution adopted in 2010, the central government is devolving 
responsibility for multiple functions to 47 elected county governments and providing a minimum 
of 15 percent of national revenues to counties to carry out those functions. The main functions for 
agriculture (crop and animal husbandry services, extension, agricultural marketing and other 
related services) were transferred in August 2013 (the national government remains in charge of 
policy and research). With some exceptions, County agricultural services are in an embryonic 
state, with limited and in some cases no technical and/or operational capacity.
Sectoral and Institutional Context
4. In Kenya, agriculture remains one of the most important sectors of the economy. But 
about 83 percent of Kenya?s land area is in the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs), which are 
mainly pastoral areas and the remaining 17 percent (where 80 percent of population lives) is 
classified as medium to high agricultural potential zone. In 2013, the sector contributed almost 27 
percent to the national GDP . The crops, livestock and fisheries sub-sectors contributed 
approximately 78, 20 and 2 percent to agricultural GDP respectively. The sector employs more 
than 75 percent of the workforce (also accounts for more than one-fifth of formal employment), 
generates most of the country?s food requirements, and plays a key role in poverty reduction. It

also generates nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of merchandise exports and roughly 60 percent of 
foreign exchange earnings.  
 
5. Overall, Kenya?s agricultural sector performance has been highly volatile with growth 
rates dipping into negative territory in nine years between 1980 and 2012 (Figure 1 below). 
Kenya?s agricultural growth rate has averaged between 3.4 percent during 1995-2003 and 
decreased to an average of 2.1 percent in 2003-2011 period. Recent years have witnessed 
increased volatility in agricultural growth rates with debilitating impacts on rural households 
incomes and employment; urban and rural food security, poverty reduction and the country?s 
overall economic growth. The sector?s growth in real gross value-added decelerated in 2013 to 
2.9 percent from a revised growth of 4.2 percent in 2012. The lowest agricultural GDP growth 
rate and value-added was noted in 2008, during a period which Kenya experienced the post-
election violence following the country?s 2007 general elections. 
   
6. Extreme weather events, largely droughts and to a lesser extent floods, have been the 
principal driver behind the volatility in the agricultural sector?s performance in Kenya.  The 
frequency and intensity of severe weather events have increased and this trend will be further 
amplified in the future as temperatures rise due to climate change . The World Bank?s agricultural 
sector risk assessment (2014) highlighted that recurring drought has profound effects on the 
agricultural sector, particularly in maize (main staple food) and livestock (in pastoral systems) 
production. Frequent drought events resulted in precipitous crop losses, livestock deaths, spikes in 
food prices, increased food insecurity and malnutrition for the poor and led to rural population 
displacement (temporary migrations).  
 
7. Kenya?s strong reliance on rain fed maize production system in meeting its food needs 
and growing consolidation of production toward maize (and dry beans) has rendered the country 
increasingly vulnerable to supply disruptions and food shortages. Amid declining yields, 
productivity gains have come largely through land expansion into marginal areas that receive 
lower and more variable rainfall. This trend, coupled with Kenya? increasingly erratic rainfall, 
has made the country?s maize production more susceptible to moisture stress and year-on-year 
yield variability, with significant implications for national food security.  This has contributed to a 
growing structural deficit in maize/food production, a gap currently filled by rising imports, 
aggravating the country?s exposure to globally-driven commodity price shocks. Emergency food 
aid and other ex-post responses has helped fuel growing dependency and declining resilience, 
particularly among the poorest and especially those in the ASALs. 
 
8. Livestock production plays an important socio-economic role in many areas across 
Kenya, particularly in the ASALs where it accounts for as much as nine-tenths of employment 
and family income. Extensive livestock systems and pastoralists in Kenya?s northern rangelands 
are particularly vulnerable to the effects of drought. Estimated losses to livestock populations 
from droughts that have occurred within the most recent decade amount to more than US$1.08 
billion. Ancillary losses related to production assets and future income and the costs of ex-post 
response measures are likely several times that figure. The increased incidence of droughts across 
the ASALs in recent years means that affected communities have less time to recover and rebuild 
their assets. This has weakened traditional coping mechanisms and handicapped household 
resilience against future shocks. 
 
9. Climate variability is already having an impact on agriculture and food security in Kenya,

as a result of increased prevalence of extreme events (especially droughts) and increased 
unpredictability of weather patterns.  For example, severe droughts that occurred in 1991/92, 
1995/96, 1998/2000, 2004/2005, and 2008-11, resulted in precipitous crop losses, livestock 
deaths, spikes in food prices, increased food insecurity and malnutrition for the poor, and led to 
rural population displacement (temporary migrations). Two noteworthy extreme climate events 
are the 1998 El Nino and the 2009 drought, which resulted in a combined total cost of US$2.8 
billion (about 7 percent of the 2010 GDP equivalent).   Frequent droughts also make Kenya 
significantly food insecure.  In 2015, it ranked 83rd of 109 countries, on the Global Food Security 
Index (GFSI).   Kenya is also highly vulnerable to climate change risks. The Center for Global 
Development ranks Kenya 13th out of 233 countries globally for ?direct risks? due to ?extreme 
weather? and 71st out of 233 for ?overall vulnerability? to climate change, even when adjusted 
for coping ability.  
 
10. Kenya?s average annual temperatures increased by 1Â°C between 1960 and 2003 , and 
by 1.5Â°C in the country?s drier regions.   Climate change is projected to reduce agricultural 
yields and livestock productivity, worsening the effect of climate shocks on the food system. 
Agriculture in Kenya is largely (98 percent) rain fed and thus extremely vulnerable to increasing 
temperatures and droughts.  Estimates of crop yield and livestock losses will vary greatly, but 
most global climate models project severe and adverse consequences, especially for the most 
food-insecure regions.  In Kenya, studies also show that by 2030, under a business as usual 
scenario, climate change will most likely reduce yields of staple crops (by 12 percent in maize, 23 
percent in rice, and 13 percent in wheat).  Crop land suitability is also expected to change, 
especially in wheat and maize. Depending on the region and types of production systems, water 
scarcity will result in less productive pastures, lower dairy yields, and higher risk of the spread of 
diseases.   
 
11. Climate change will exacerbate the vulnerability of Kenya?s agricultural sector as 
projections show increases in mean annual temperature of 1Â°C to 1.5Â°C by 2030. 
Consequently, changes in rainfall distribution and more frequent extreme events, such as 
prolonged drought and floods are predicted to result in more water shortages, especially in ASAL 
regions. While precipitation is projected to increase between 0.2 and 0.4 percent per year in 
Kenya, the direction and magnitude of change will vary considerably across regions, and 
warming-induced increases in evaporation rates are likely to offset the benefits of precipitation 
increases in some regions. Meeting this challenge will require both investments in building 
resilience to near-term shocks and in adapting to long-term climate change. In this context, 
climate smart agriculture (CSA) offers an appropriate strategic framework for responding to and 
reducing the adverse effects of climate change.  
 
12. Agriculture is the largest source of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in Kenya, 
contributing about 58.6 percent to total GHG emissions. Contributions of other sectors to national 
GHG emissions are: energy (25.3 percent), industry (3.2 percent) and waste management (1.2 
percent).   The agricultural sector is also a key driver of deforestation and land degradation, which 
account for an additional 32 percent of national GHG emissions.  Agricultural emissions are 
likely to increase from 20 MtCO2e in 2010 to 27 MtCO2e in 2030, largely driven by livestock 
methane emissions, which account for 96.2 percent of agricultural emissions. Agriculture, 
therefore, needs to reduce its GHG emissions and become part of the solution to tackle climate 
change. The sector plays an important role in sequestering carbon in soil and trees on farms.  It 
has the biophysical potential to offset and sequester about 20 percent of total annual emissions

through improved soil management techniques.   Currently, the world?s soils hold three times 
more carbon than the atmosphere. Soils also have significant potential to absorb a larger amount 
of carbon from the atmosphere than they currently do.  Restoring this carbon to the soil will not 
only sequester carbon from the atmosphere, but also boost productivity, increase water retention 
(leading to greater resilience when droughts occur), bring land back into production (thereby 
reducing pressure on biodiversity and forests), and boost incomes (thereby benefiting the rural 
poor). Similarly, Kenya?s livestock GHG emission intensities (i.e. amount of GHGs emitted per 
unit of product) amongst the highest in the world; this is mainly due to low livestock productivity. 
With the continuing rising demand for livestock products this threatens to become a growing 
problem.  Increasing livestock productivity (e.g., through improved forages and providing 
adequate year-round feed resources) would increase incomes, protect people?s asset base, as well 
as reduce GHG e/unit of product.  
 
13. The proposed CSA project can help Kenya meet the rising demand for food; and attain 
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of ending poverty (SDG1) and hunger (SDG2), and 
combating climate change and its impacts (SDG13). But this would require investing in 
agricultural technologies, innovations and management practices (TIMPs) that would lead into 
CSA?s triple-win: increased agricultural productivity, enhanced resilience to climate change, and 
reduced GHG emissions. 
 
14. Kenya has a wide spectrum of CSA policies, strategies and plans that would help secure 
the triple-win. The Vision 2030 recognizes the significance of agriculture to its goal of achieving 
an average GDP growth rate of 10 percent per year up to the year 2030. This level of growth will 
be crucial for attaining the SDGs 1 and 2 of ending poverty and hunger, respectively.  Kenya?s 
Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS, 2010?2020) operationalizes the Vision 2030 
by focusing on transforming smallholder agriculture from low-productivity subsistence activities 
to more innovative, agri-business oriented agriculture. Regarding adaptation to climate change, 
ASDS prioritizes investments in weather information systems, research on drought tolerant crop 
varieties, soil and water conservation, water harvesting, and strengthening integrated pest 
management systems. For livestock, it prioritizes improved management of grazing systems, 
biogas, livestock diversification, and improved breeding of animals.  
 
15. Kenya also has a National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS, 2010) that 
provides a framework for integrating climate change into development priorities. The National 
Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP, 2012)  operationalizes the NCCRS, and emphasizes low-
carbon, climate-resilient development pathway for the economy that is critical for achieving SDG 
13 of combating climate change and its impacts.  In the NCCAP, Kenya planned for a low-carbon 
Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) pathway for six sectors, namely energy, 
transport, industry, agriculture, forestry and waste management.  The first activity undertaken 
under the NAMAs process was the analysis of emissions from the forestry and agriculture sectors. 
Selected practices for mitigation in the NCCAP included restoration of forest on degraded lands; 
REDD+; agroforestry; increase tree cover to 10 percent of total land area; conservation tillage; 
limiting use of fire in cropland; rangeland management; improved cook stoves; biogas; and 
management of agricultural wastes. The proposed Project will support these interventions, which 
are aimed at achieving the CSA triple-win of increasing productivity, building resilience to 
climate change, and reducing GHG emissions. 
 
16. The Kenya Climate Change Bill (2014) is about to be approved by the President, after

undergoing a public hearing and passing through the Senate. More recently, Kenya has developed 
a Climate-Smart Agriculture Program (CSAP, 2015?2030), that will be jointly implemented by 
MoALF, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MENR), and the Ministry of Water 
and Irrigation (MoWI). The Vision for the CSAP is a ?climate resilient and low carbon growth 
sustainable agriculture that ensures food security and contributes to national development goals in 
line with Kenya Vision 2030.?  In addition, Kenya has a National Policy on Climate Finance 
(2015) that seeks to position Kenya to better access climate finance through a variety of 
mechanisms. With support from the World Bank, the International Center for Tropical 
Agricultural (CIAT) recently developed a Kenya CSA Country Profile. The Profile systematically 
assesses the state of CSA nationally, including agricultural practices that deliver higher 
productivity, improved resilience, and lower emissions. It also assesses the institutional, policy, 
and finance entry points for taking CSA options to scale. The Profile will be an important 
mechanism for building awareness of country options, facilitating dialogue, and helping identify 
high-interest CSA options and opportunities for investments to deliver on the triple win. The 
Profiles coupled with prioritization tools  can provide in depth analyses of agricultural practices, 
detailed assessments of their ?climate-smartness?, and costs and benefits of various investments. 
The ongoing development of County-level CSA risk profiles and prioritization of interventions 
would bring this information to the relevant level of devolved governance in Kenya. 
 
17. At the international level, Kenya has been actively engaged in dialogue on mainstreaming 
climate change into agricultural policies, plans, and actions. The country is a signatory to the 
United Nations Conventions on Combating Desertification (UNCCD), Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC) and Conservation of Biological Diversity (UNCBD). Regionally, 
Kenya is implementing the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme 
(CAADP) Framework (2010) and the East African Community Climate Change Policy 
(EACCCP). Both of these frameworks emphasize sustainable land and water management for 
improved agricultural productivity through research, technology adoption and dissemination; and 
agricultural GHG emissions reduction. In July 2015, Kenya declared its Intended Nationally 
Determined Contributions (INDC) to UNFCCC that by 2030, the country seeks to abate its total 
GHG emissions by 30 percent relative to the ?business as usual? scenario of 143 MtCO2-e. It is 
suggested that US$40 billion would be required to finance the mitigation and adaptation efforts 
across six key sectors until 2030.

18. The Kenya CPS (2014-2018) highlights achieving rapid and uninterrupted growth over a 
decade or more as the foundational challenge for Kenya. The CPS indicate that for Kenya to make 
a huge dent on poverty, support for the growth and realization of people?s potential must focus on 
sectors and locations where the majority of the poor can benefit. In rural areas, the single most 
sustainable impact would be to improve agricultural performance, both in terms of increased 
productivity and resilience to shocks, including climate change risks. The proposed KCSAP aims 
at fulfilling two priority domains of the CPS: (i) Domain 2 ? ?Protection and potential for shared 
prosperity?, KCSAP will contribute to Outcome 4 (Greater agricultural productivity), and 
Outcome 6 (Improved capacity to manage risks from Climate Change); and (ii) Domain 3 ? ?
Consistency and equity in delivering a devolution dividend?, KCSAP will contribute to Outcome 
8 (Better provision of agricultural extension services by counties) and Outcome 9 (Adequate 
systems to monitor performance of services delivery by counties). The proposed project is also 
well aligned with current GoK policies and priorities as articulated above.  
 
19. The proposed Project is also in line with the Africa Climate Business Plan: Accelerating

Climate Resilience and Low-Carbon Development. The Plan aims at boosting the region?s ability 
to adapt to the changing climate while reducing GHG emissions through a number of concrete 
actions in various sectors. For agricultural sector, the Plan is focusing on promoting climate-smart 
agriculture, creating climate-resilient landscapes, and promoting integrated watershed 
management. It underscores that there is a range of agricultural management solutions, which can 
improve crop productivity, enhance resilience to climate shocks and reduce carbon emissions.

C.  Proposed Development Objective(s)

Proposed Development Objective(s) (From PCN)
20. The proposed development objective is to increase agricultural productivity and build 
resilience to climate change risks in the targeted smallholder farming and pastoral communities in 
Kenya. 
 
21. The PDO is informed by the CSA concept; one that ambitiously aims to integrate climate 
change risks responsiveness into agricultural development activities. The CSA outcomes are 
increased productivity, enhanced resilience, and reduced GHG emissions. While the concept is 
new and still evolving, many of the practices that make up CSA already exist worldwide and are 
used by farmers to cope with various production risks – particularly droughts and floods. The 
utility of CSA then comes in as a way of explicitly integrating productivity, adaptation, and 
mitigation planning, often done in isolation; and understanding of expected outcomes of CSA 
investments on different users and locations over time.

Key Results (From PCN)
22. Achievement of the proposed PDO will be measured using the following outcome 
indicators: (i) Increased yields of selected crop and livestock value chains (percent); (ii) Direct 
project beneficiaries adopting TIMPs leading to CSA triple-win (percent);  (iii) Increased land 
covered due to adoption of agro-forestry and sustainable land management (SLM)  practices 
(percent); (iv) Improved access to agro-weather, technical and market information by direct 
beneficiaries(percent);  and (v) Direct project beneficiaries (number), of which female (percent).  
A detailed results monitoring framework and indicators will be developed during the project 
preparation, and enhanced by quantitative modeling of uncertainties along the impact pathway .

D.  Concept Description

A. Concept  
 
23. Climate resilient agriculture that increases productivity requires a major shift in the way 
land, water, soil nutrients and genetic resources are managed to ensure that they are used more 
efficiently, effectively and equitably. Making such a shift requires considerable investments in 
ongoing and new technologies, rural/production infrastructure, financing/credit mechanisms, as 
well as improving farmers? access to climatic information and markets. Actions to build climate 
resilience can, in many cases, also mitigate climate change by reducing GHG emissions or 
increasing carbon sinks.  
 
24. Kenya has three main agricultural production systems. The smallholder mixed crop-
livestock system found in areas that receive more than 1,000 mm of rainfall annually (high 
potential zones), spreading from central Kenya, through the central Rift Valley to western Kenya 
and the coastal strip. This system takes the form of a maize-based, dairy production system with 
or without cash crops, such as coffee, tea and horticulture. The crop-livestock-tree production

(Agro-silvo-pastoral) system found in areas that receive between 750 and 1,000 mm of rainfall 
annually (medium potential zones). This system focuses on integration of livestock and crops, soil 
and water conservation, and growing drought tolerant and early maturing crops. In some areas, 
irrigation schemes have also been set up to enhance crop production. The pastoral/extensive 
livestock production system  found in areas receiving 200?750 mm of rainfall annually (low 
potential zones), stretching from north and north-eastern Kenya to the southern parts bordering 
Tanzania. Livestock production, mainly beef animals and small ruminants, are the major 
enterprises under small-scale, but also some large scale ranches 
 
25. KCSAP will primarily focus on supporting interventions aimed at increasing productivity 
and building resilience to climate change, with reduction of GHG emissions as a potential co-
benefit , where possible and appropriate, through: (a) Promoting sustainable, community?driven 
rangeland management and improved access to quality livestock services in ASALs (i.e. in 
pastoral/extensive livestock production systems); (b) Improving water/soil management, 
especially within smallholder maize systems in the marginal rainfall zones (i.e. in smallholder 
mixed crop-livestock, crop-livestock-tree production (Agro-silvo-pastoral systems), and crop-
forest production (agro-forestry)); (c) Supporting the generation and dissemination of improved 
agricultural technologies,  innovations, and management practices, and building a sustainable 
seed system; and (d) Enhancing access to quality climate/agro-weather, advisory services, and 
market information among farmers/herders for improved decision making. 
 
26. KCSAP interventions will be concentrated in selected counties within the crop-livestock-
tree production system and pastoral/extensive livestock production system (mainly in ASALs), 
with high potential for increasing production, but ones that are also prone to droughts. To 
maximize the impact of project interventions, about 15 - 20 counties will be selected using these 
criteria: (a) vulnerability to climate change, extreme weather events, and variable rainfall; (b) 
potential for increasing agricultural and livestock production; (c) current share in national 
agricultural production; (d) climate change projections; and (e) poverty distribution and rates. The 
project design would be informed by the following seven main principles:   
 
(i) Prioritization of promising TIMPs: CSA is very context specific?what is CSA in one 
place is not necessarily CSA in another place?so there is a need to prioritize technologies that are 
most promising for specific places and provide the best value for money. The CCAFS-CIAT CSA 
Prioritization Framework is one such approach that entails a series of activities to filter a long list 
of possible CSA options into a set of best-bet practices and services for an area ;   
 
(ii) Scaling-up promising TIMPs: The Bank and other donor-funded projects in Kenya, such 
as the Kenya Adaptation to Climate Change in Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (KACCAL) and Kenya 
Agricultural Productivity and Sustainable Land Management Project (KAPSLMP) have used 
participatory and community-driven development (CDD) approaches to pilot a number of 
adaptation and mitigation TIMPs including financing options, such as the Payment for Ecosystem 
Services (PES). While existing TIMPs are a good starting point and their broader application 
needs to be scaled up, new technologies must be developed to achieve the CSA triple-win;  
 
(iii) Value chain (VC) approach:  An approach that focuses on developing priority, promising 
agricultural and livestock commodities in the respective counties, through interventions covering 
production, value addition and links to markets will be taken. This approach will look at supply 
chains, delivery channels, and enabling environment issues, to identify and address bottlenecks

and leverage points in the chains. Innovation platforms and methodologies, such as LINK  
developed by CIAT provides approaches for developing innovative business models that take a 
value chain approach and link smallholder farmers to markets; and IFC can finance private sector 
investments, such as in animal health services, commercial-scale bio digesters, solar-pumps, 
micro-and-drip irrigation, seed production and distribution, on-farm storage, weather info/
advisory/climate services, rural credit, and processing facilities; 
 
(iv) Gender sensitivity: Looking at various interventions through a gender lens to ensure that 
the project benefits women as much as possible. Alternative livelihood interventions would be 
primarily geared for women participants. Special care would be paid to ensure that intervention 
do not contribute to increased drudgery and burden for women; 
 
(v) Nutrition informed: Favoring those interventions and leveraging activities that have a 
direct and indirect links with improving the nutritional outcome (dietary/nutrients diversification 
using fruit tree and vegetables ) of the project beneficiaries, particularly women and children 
under the age of five;  
 
(vi) Collaboration with other World Bank Group Agencies: The VC development approach 
will require a close collaboration with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the 
Multilateral International Guarantee Agency (MIGA), which have greater roles to play in 
agricultural value addition, linking smallholder farmers to markets (i.e. inputs, outputs and 
financial markets); and abating political risk for local and international private investors, 
respectively; and 
 
(vii) Complementarity with other interventions: Ensuring that synergies and alignment with 
other Bank-funded projects, such as the National Agricultural and Rural Inclusive Growth Project 
(NARIGP), and the Rural Roads Project (RRP), given that could be operating in the same 
counties, will allow for greater complementarity and impact. 
 
27. Although reduced GHG emissions might be co-benefits, these will nonetheless be 
measured. At appraisal stage, the project will undertake GHG accounting to estimate the impact 
of project interventions against a baseline. It is expected that by improving per unit efficiency, the 
project will have a positive impact on GHG net emissions.  
 
Project Components  
 
28. The proposed project will comprise four components briefly presented below: 
 
Component 1: Upscaling Climate-Smart Agricultural Practices (US$100 million) 
 
29. This component aims at supporting and incentivizing smallholder farmers to implement 
TIMPs that provide triple-wins: increased productivity, stronger resilience and reductions in GHG 
emissions, as co-benefits. It will comprise two subcomponents. 
 
Subcomponent 1.1: Supporting Pastoral/Extensive Livestock Production Systems (US$40 
million) 
 
30. Livestock production is a key contributor to CSA?s three strategic outcomes: (i)

agricultural productivity and food security - animals contribute directly (through meat and milk 
output) and indirectly (through fertilization, draft power) to food production and also to income 
diversification; (ii) adaptation to climate change - livestock represents a diversification asset, a 
coping mechanism for households (risk management tool, that contributes to household 
resilience), and a contributor to the management of organic matter in soils (through manure), 
which improves water retention and drought resistance; and (iii) mitigation - there is typically a 
great potential for reducing GHG emission intensity among low productivity ruminant systems, 
and carbon sequestration in pastures.  
 
31. This subcomponent will therefore support interventions aimed at: (a) increasing 
productivity of livestock (e.g. feeding practices, animal health, herd management and off-take 
rates); (b) promoting integrated soil fertility and SLM practices based on crop-livestock 
integration (e.g., manure management, biogas production, use of crop residues and food products) 
and modern inputs; and (c) supporting market access (e.g., stock routes/migratory corridors, 
watering points, quarantine or holding grounds and animal markets). 
 
32.  In the arid lands, ensuring that pastoralists can access feed and water resources at critical 
times is essential to resilience. Demography and increased pressure on land and water are greatly 
challenging the traditional arrangements through which sedentary and mobile populations have 
managed resources. The project will thus support the development of new management practices 
and institutional arrangements that can secure pastoralists? access to resources, especially during 
drought and the dry season. In the semi-arid lands, interventions may aim at increasing the 
efficiency of animal production (e.g., feeding practices, animal health, herd management and off-
take rates), increasing crop-livestock integration (e.g., manure management, use of crop residues 
and food by-products), and increasing institutional mechanisms and markets for resilience.  
 
33. Interventions inter alia could promote: (i) innovative rangeland co-management (state and 
local community) approaches that leverage customary forms of collective action and economic 
instruments to reward sound pasture management; (ii) development of fodder production, storage 
and marketing; (iii) small-scale fattening operations managed by pastoral communities, to which 
young animals from mobile herds could be sent for fattening before commercialization; and (iv) 
sustainable resource use practices, including  contour ridges and barriers, cisterns for storing 
rainfall and runoff water, controlled/rotational grazing, grazing banks, homestead enclosures, 
residue/forage conservation and other practices ensuring access to feed and water resources 
during drought. ILRI has relevant research outputs to contribute to these interventions.  
 
Subcomponent 1.2: Supporting Smallholder Mixed Crop-Livestock-Tree Systems (US$60 
million) 
 
34. The smallholder mixed crop-livestock-tree systems account for more than 70 percent of 
total maize output in Kenya. Characterized by low productivity, these systems are increasingly 
vulnerable to extreme and variable weather. Thus, achieving national food security will require 
concerted efforts and targeted investments to improve yields and strengthen their resilience. 
 
35. This subcomponent will therefore focus on: (a) improving water and soil management; 
(b) promo ting livelihoods and crop diversification, including drought-tolerant crops (e.g., 
legumes - beans, cowpeas, pigeon pea etc.,), intensive dairy production and agro-forestry systems; 
(c) investing in small-scale irrigation development; and climate risk mitigation initiatives,

including exploring the smallholder adapted crop insurance options.  
 
36. KCSAP support under this component will aim at promoting sustainable intensification 
and increasing climate resilience of Kenya?s small-scale, rain fed production systems. This will 
be achieved through myriad, yet mutually-supportive interventions designed to improve crop 
yields and reduce losses (pre-and post-harvest) in the near-term, and to mitigate climate change 
impacts via adaptation over the long-term. Project interventions will focus on, inter alia, curbing 
rainfall run-off, improving soil nutrition and moisture holding capacity, and strengthening 
fertilizer- and water-use efficiency. This will be achieved via incentivizing broad farmer adoption 
of improved water, soil and land resource TIMPs. To promote income diversification, the project 
will promote take-up of animal husbandry, micro-gardening, agro-forestry and other income 
generating activities less dependent on rainfall. 
 
37. KCSAP investments will be guided by County Integrated Development Plans (CIDPs)  
and community priorities. Integrating project activities within the CIDPs will ensure alignment, 
sustainability and optimization of outcomes. In the case of high agricultural (medium-to high 
rainfall) potential areas in the central and western highlands, interventions will broadly focus on 
improving maize yields and farm-gate prices via quality, drying and storage upgrades. In more 
marginal, more variable rainfall zones, greater emphasis will be placed on stimulating farmers? 
uptake of more robust, drought-tolerant crops (e.g., cowpeas, cassava, millet and sorghum). 
Project interventions will also aim to enhance risk-sharing and strengthen smallholder access to 
markets across target food commodity chains via catalyzing upgrades (i.e. product, process) and 
downstream linkages (horizontal and vertical).   
 
38. Matching grants will be provided to common interest groups (CIGs) organized along the 
VCs to finance community micro-projects. The grants will enable smallholder farmers adopt 
TIMPs developed under Component 2. Making direct payments to farmers conditional on 
adoption of climate adaptation and mitigation practices will lead to better CSA triple-win 
outcomes.  
 
Component 2: Strengthening Climate-Smart Agricultural Research and Seed Systems (US$60 
million) 
 
39. Building strong research capacity and seed systems at the national level is critical for 
achieving the CSA triple-win: increasing productivity, building resilience and reducing GHG 
emissions. Strong and sustained support to agricultural research and development (R&D) can 
have large payoffs as evidenced by R&D?s significant contribution to the impressive agricultural 
growth achieved in Brazil, China and India. More broadly, returns to investment in agricultural 
research have been high and the benefits will only rise as the losses from climate-induced crop 
and livestock systems failure increase. Investments in seed and animal breeds research and their 
market-driven distribution systems will better equip farmers and livestock keepers with timely 
access to quality, affordable seeds (also for forage crops - grasses, legumes, herbage, fodder trees 
and regeneration practices) and planting materials; and animal breeds that respond to their 
specific needs (e.g., higher-yielding, fast maturing, drought resistant, and heat tolerant breeds) 
and that would help them better manage growing climate change risks. This component will have 
two subcomponents ? supporting CSA research and innovations, and building competitive and 
sustainable seed system.

Subcomponent 2.1: Supporting Climate-Smart Agricultural Research and Innovations (US$40 
million) 
 
40. A renewed urgency, and international and national commitment, is needed to sustain CSA 
research to deliver needed science-based solutions. Kenya should act now given that developing 
improved TIMPs can take many years. Developing improved seeds, planting materials and 
livestock breeds that are more adapted to changing climates to meet rising food demand, while at 
the same time reducing GHG emissions will need significantly more investment in agricultural 
research and development.  It also requires commitment to strengthen the Kenya Agricultural and 
Livestock Research Organization (KALRO); build partnerships with international research 
institutes (e.g., CGIAR institutes, such as the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) and the 
International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), International Center for Tropical Agriculture 
(CIAT), ICRISAT, which operate in Kenya) and local universities (e.g., University of Nairobi, 
Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT), Moi and Egerton); and 
engage the private sector (contracted extension services delivery model) to facilitate the uptake of 
TIMPs at local levels.  But agricultural research and innovation processes require long-term 
political commitment, financial stability, human resources, and institutional strength. Thus this 
subcomponent would finance activities aimed at strengthening national agricultural research 
system (NARS) and competitive collaborative research grants focusing on CSA research and 
innovations. 
 
Subcomponent 2.2: Building a Competitive and Sustainable Seed Systems (US$20 million) 
 
41. Kenya has one of the more developed cereal (maize and wheat) seed systems in Africa 
with over 70 registered seed merchants. But legume seed systems are poorly developed. Highly 
regulated, the formal cereal seed system produces over 30,000 tons of seed per annum. But only 
supplies about one-quarter of the country?s total seed needs. The remaining supply mostly comes 
from recycled seeds. While robust seed research by KALRO and CIMMYT, among others, have 
resulted in the release of dozens of improved maize and other varietals (e.g., drought-tolerant, 
high-yielding, disease-resistant, and short-season) that can help farmers better respond to climate 
and market signals and manage uncertainty, adoption among smallholders remains low. Even in 
ASAL regions that receive less than 500 mm of rainfall per annum, farmers continue to grow 
maize rather than drought-tolerant crops, such as sorghum and millet.  Such areas could benefit 
more from short duration legumes, such as beans, cowpea and pigeon pea. As a result, the 
productivity of many staple crops (e.g., wheat and maize) remains below regional averages.  
 
42. The project will promote pluralistic seed systems model depending on level of crop 
development. Working with KEPHIS , Kenya Seed Company (KSC), KALRO, CIMMYT , 
ICRAF  and other stakeholders, KCSAP will finance activities geared towards strengthening seed 
research (e.g., seed production and processing equipment, TA and training, grants for community-
level seed multiplication, etc.,), as well as promoting commercially viable multiplication and 
distribution systems to ensure that farmers and pastoralists have access to the right seeds at the 
right time. Specifically, KCSAP will finance interventions related t o: (i) strengthening the 
capacity of KALRO?s research centers/institutes in the production of foundation seed; (ii) 
supporting private sector companies involved in the commercial seed production and community-
based seed multiplication systems; (iii) promoting the use of selected drought-resistant seeds; (iv) 
strengthening seed associations and inter-professional organizations; (v) supporting innovative 
mechanisms of seed marketing; and (vi) strengthening seed policy, production and distribution

strategies and institution al support to the national seed control and certification agency.  
 
Component 3: Supporting Agro-weather, Market, Climate and Advisory Services (US$30 million)
 
43. Improving productivity and resilience of smallholder farmers requires access to timely, 
cost-effective, and personally relevant information on improved agricultural practices, markets, 
prices, inputs, weather?and news of impending disasters. Integrating information on weather and 
markets into planning for CSA interventions and sustainable agriculture development entails: (a) 
use of modern tools for climate data sourcing and analysis, including automatic meteorological 
measurements and satellite data products on a near real-time basis; (b) analysis of weather risks 
and assessment of impacts using advanced crop?weather interactions modeling; (c) formulation of 
highly practical advice that farmers can apply directly to their operations; and (d) dissemination 
of weather and market advisories to farmers using modern information and communication 
technologies (ICT). 
 
44. The quality of these climate and market information services are critically low or non-
existent in many parts of Kenya. Under this component, KCSAP will address this obstacle by 
developing modern agro-weather forecasting and dissemination tools, as well as marketing 
information system to help farmers address the challenges of climate variability and change and 
enhance their resilience. 
 
45. Building on infrastructure already provided to KALRO under the Kenya Agricultural 
Productivity and Agribusiness Project (KAPAP), as well as experiences of BNPP-funded Agro-
weather Tools for Climate Smart Agriculture pilots in Embu, Kenya,  this component will finance 
interventions related to the following: (i) improving agro-meteorological forecasting and 
monitoring; (ii) developing climate-smart, location-specific agro-weather and market information 
system and advisories using ?big data?; and (iii) building institutional and technical capacity for 
agro-meteorological observation, forecasting and market advisory dissemination.  
 
Subcomponent 3.1: Improving Agro-meteorological Forecasting and Monitoring (US$15 million) 
 
46. One of the main obstacles to effective meteorological forecasting is Kenya?s limited 
agro-meteorological observation network. To improve data collection and geographic coverage, 
existing agro-meteorological and hydro logical stations will be upgraded, whilst modern, near real 
time automated weather stations (AWS) will be installed in areas lacking the facilities. KCSAP 
will work with other initiatives that are already in-place to expand the country?s agro-
meteorological and hydrological network to meet international standards. This subcomponent will 
therefore finance the following investments: (a) installation of new AWS, hydrometric stations 
and rain gauges to complement existing weather infrastructure; (b) upgrade and modernization of 
the existing agro-meteorological network and priority hydrological stations country-wide; (c) 
establishment of agro-meteorological centers in targeted counties to improve drought and flood 
forecasts; and (d) development of the Kenya Meteorological Services (KMS) early warning 
system (EWS), and building institutional capacity for disaster preparedness and mitigation.  
 
Subcomponent 3.2: Developing Integrated Weather and Market Information System (US$5 
million) 
 
47. Systems that integrate agro-weather and market information are either non-existent or

rudimentary in Kenya. KCSAP will address this problem under this subcomponent by financing 
activities related to: (a) developing ?big data? for CSA; (b) developing Market Information 
Systems (MIS) and services; and (c) delivering integrated weather and market advisory services 
using ICT.  Big data  crop-weather analytics help farmers in making decisions on what, when, and 
where to plant. Using advanced statistical and data mining/machine learning algorithms,  time 
series data of crop yields will be combined with weather observations at daily resolution  from 
agro-meteorological stations and satellite data,  soil and management factors to reveal climate and 
weather patterns, and detect the limiting factors for crop production. This would subsequently be 
used to generate timely and site-specific recommendations on crop cultivars, soil preparation, 
sowing rate and time, fertilization, irrigation, pest and diseases control, harvest time, and storage 
options. Access to reliable market information from the MIS using ICT empowers farmers to 
obtain and negotiate fair market prices for their crops subsequently improving their income and 
livelihoods. It also reduces their overall risk and results in greater price stability in supply and 
demand, in addition to improving overall market transparency. Using multiple ICT channel to 
reach target users will allow bi-directional information exchange - allowing the collection of data 
from farmers, as well as information delivery to farmers. Rapid and geographically targeted agro-
weather information will be disseminated using SMS and smart phone applications, and through 
more conventional radio, television, bulletins and print messages. Interactive Voice Response 
(IVR) systems that render weather conditions into human speech will also be incorporated. 
 
Subcomponent 3.3: Building Institutional and Technical Capacity (US$10 million) 
 
48. The capacity for agro-meteorological observation, forecasting and advisory dissemination 
needs to be strengthened at the MoALF, KMS, KALRO, and at county governments. KCSAP will 
finance activities related to human and institutional capacity building at these agencies. This will 
include: (a) defining proper configuration of the main elements of the system; including 
automated monitoring, new forecast techniques, big data analytics and modernization of 
management; (b) analyzing and utilizing big data for various purposes; and (c) providing the 
hardware and software needed for interaction of data from a variety of sources in a way that is 
efficient and scalable. Capacity of scientists at national and county levels will be strengthened in 
the area of crop modeling, using both deterministic and statistical models of different complexity 
levels. KCSAP will partner with national and international research and academic institutions to 
provide state-of-art training in agro-meteorology, climate science, including downscaling and 
weather predictions, artificial neural network and machine learning applications, seasonal 
forecasting, ICT, GIS and remote sensing. KALRO?s capacity to implement a national soil 
information service based on soil spectroscopy and remote sensing technology to help target 
interventions and monitor impacts on soil health will be further enhanced . 
 
Component 4: Project Coordination and Management (US$20 million) 
 
49. The Project will be implemented by MoALF with close collaboration with MENR and 
MoWI at the national level and county governments at subnational level. Activities financed 
under this component will comprise coordination, fiduciary aspects, M&E, safeguards monitoring 
and compliance, and day-to-day implementation of the project; and consists of three 
subcomponents. 
 
Subcomponent 4.1: Project Coordination (US$15 million)

50. The purpose of this subcomponent is to ensure that the project is implemented in 
accordance with the Financing Agreement. A Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and a small team 
of experts located at the national and participating county levels will be established. Costs related 
to national and county level project coordination (i.e., salaries of the contract staff, operations and 
maintenance (O&M), office space rental, fuel and spare parts of vehicles, office equipment, 
furniture and tools, among others) will be financed. Safeguards monitoring and compliance will 
be carried out under this subcomponent.  
 
Subcomponent 4.2: Monitoring & Evaluation and Impact Evaluation (US$5 million) 
 
51. An M&E system will be established to collect and process appropriate information, to 
verify the output, effects and eventually the impacts of project activities over time. Baseline 
information for M&E will be collected as part of the preparation process. In addition to the 
routine M&E functions (e.g., data collection, analysis and reporting), it will also finance the 
baseline, mid-point and end of project impact evaluation of the project; and the development and 
operation of the ICT-based Climate Smart Agriculture Information System. Where possible, 
M&E approaches will be harmonized with continental and global efforts (e.g., Global Alliance for 
CSA and the Alliance for CSA in Africa) to build robust and harmonized evidence of the impacts 
of TIMPs supported by the project to achieve CSA triple-win.  
 
Subcomponent 4.3: Contingency Emergency Response (US$0 million) 
 
52. This subcomponent will finance natural disasters risk management (DRM) activities in 
the agriculture sector. The contingency emergence response financing will be triggered through 
formal declaration of a national emergency and upon a formal request from the GoK.  In such 
cases, funds from unallocated category and other project components could be reallocated to 
finance emergency response expenditures and meet crises and emergency needs.  
 
53. The subcomponent will finance the training and capacity building for disaster risk 
management (DRM); community-managed disaster risk reduction (CMDRR) interventions; 
development of an EWS; and response, mitigation, recovery and reconstruction following 
climate-induced natural disasters. Implementation of this subcomponent will follow the 
provisions of the DRM Manual. 
 
54. Annex 3 outlines in more detail some key interventions envisioned under each project

II. SAFEGUARDS
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis (if known)
29. The project will be implemented at selected locations on a national scale. The activities will 
be implemented in the rural areas and will include projects in rural infrastructure, such as watering 
points, quarantine or holding grounds and animal markets of fodder production, storage and 
marketing sustainable resource use practices, including  contour erosion and barriers, cisterns for 
storing rainfall and runoff water, controlled/rotational grazing, grazing banks, homestead enclosures, 
residue/forage conservation and other practices ensuring access to feed and water resources during 
drought, agro-forestry projects and hydromet systems/stations.

B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
30. The MoALF will the implementing agency of KCSAP. MoALF will work closely with 
MoENR and MoWI. These ministries have adequate capacity and experience of implementing Bank-
funded projects, including knowledge for implementing World Bank safeguards in the devolved 
context. However, the implementation of previous projects identified a number of significant 
capacity issues in monitoring and enforcement of environmental and social safeguards compliance. 
KCSAP will allocate resources to build the counties’ capacity in for safeguards implementation, 
based on institutional capacity assessment that would be carried out at the project preparation stage.

D. POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental Assessment 
OP/BP 4.01

Yes The initial scoping of the proposed project 
interventions suggests that due to the nature of 
proposed activities, the potential environmental and 
social impacts will be moderate, largely reversible 
and site-specific. The identification mission noted 
that the potential project investments in rural 
infrastructure and agriculture VCs will trigger the 
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01). 
 
Given that specific micro-project designs and 
locations would not be known at the time of project 
preparation, the project will take framework 
approach to managing safeguards. There are three 
framework reports that will need to be developed by 
GoK: (a) Environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF); (b) Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF); and (c) Vulnerable and 
Marginalized Group Framework (VMGF). These 
frameworks will need to cover the types of activities 
envisioned; identify potential impacts of these 
activities; propose screening mechanisms and 
processes of assessing their impacts; and designing 
mitigation measures. The scope of these frameworks, 
the exact implementation arrangements and costs 
will be identified during project preparation. The 
preparation of ESMF, RPF and the VMGF will 
include wide public consultations and will be 
disclosed prior to project appraisal. During project 
implementation, based on the screening, an 
Environmental Assessment (EA)/ Environmental 
Management Plans (EMPs), Resettlement Action

Plans (RAPs) and Vulnerable and Marginalized 
Group Plans (VMGPs) will be developed for 
individual subprojects.

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 TBD Applicability of this policy will be confirmed during 
project preparation, based on the target areas of 
project interventions.

Forests OP/BP 4.36 TBD Applicability of this policy will be confirmed during 
project preparation, based on the target areas of 
project interventions.

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes The project is envisioned use of agrochemicals to 
implement activities such as fodder production and 
agro-forestry projects. A Pest Management Plan 
(PMP) will be prepared to promote the adoption of 
an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, 
which stresses non-chemical pest management 
methods as much as possible, with use of 
agrochemicals only as a “last resort” when  
other methods are not sufficiently effective. The 
PMP would describe specific actions needed to be 
implemented, timeframes, estimated costs, 
monitoring indicators, institutional and beneficiary 
roles and responsibilities etc.).

Physical Cultural Resources 
OP/BP 4.11

TBD Applicability of this policy will be confirmed during 
project preparation, based on the target areas of 
project interventions.

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 
4.10

TBD Applicability of this policy will be confirmed during 
project preparation, based on the target areas of 
project interventions. Should it be confirmed during 
the project preparation that the implementation will 
cover the areas where vulnerable and marginalized 
groups are present, the project will prepare the 
VMGF, which will then guide the preparation of 
VMGPs, where required.

Involuntary Resettlement OP/
BP 4.12

Yes The project activities may require land acquisition 
and may result in the loss of community resources. 
To guide the process of compensation, the project 
will prepare the RPF and publicly disclose it in 
Kenya and in the World Bank InfoShop prior to 
project appraisal.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 

 
1. Over the last two decades, Morocco has achieved relatively strong economic and social outcomes thanks to a 
series of reforms which resulted in the improvement of the well-being of its population. In the 2000-2017 period, 
Morocco’s real per capita GDP almost doubled from US$1,727 to US$2,948. Extreme poverty dropped to a level of 1 
percent and the national poverty rate declined to 4.8 percent. The main reforms which led to these achievements were 
(i) stabilization of the macroeconomic framework by reducing domestic and external vulnerabilities, (ii) enhancement of 
fiscal and financial policy frameworks, and (iii) support of economic diversification and competitiveness.  

 
2. Over the past 10 years, however, growth has been on a downward trend, and the economy has not generated 
enough jobs to reduce the persistent high rate of unemployment, especially among the youth and educated. Real GDP 
growth decelerated from an average of 4.8 percent over 1996-2006, to 4.6 percent over 2007-2011, to only 3.4 percent 
over 2012-2017. During the first half of 2018, GDP growth fell to 2.8 percent. Morocco continues to face high 
unemployment rates and substantial urban-rural disparities. Morocco has close to 34 million inhabitants of which 13.6 
million live in rural areas (WB, 2019). Approximately 1.1 million people in the country are unemployed; they represent 9-
10 percent of the working-age population and 20 percent among the youth. Poverty rates in rural areas remain twice as 
high as the poverty rates at national level and the rural population accounts for 79.4 percent of the poor. While inequality 
as measured by the Gini coefficient at national level declined from 40.7 to 39.5 between 2007 and 2014, it remains high. 

 
3. Morocco is highly exposed to climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects a 
continued warming trend for Morocco. Every decade since 1970, a 0.5 degrees Centigrade temperature increase has been 
observed, greatly exceeding the global average by about 0.15 degrees. Unless strong action is taken to mitigate this trend, 
additional temperature increases of as much as three to seven degrees Centigrade are projected for Morocco by 2100. 
The largest increases (four to seven degrees) are anticipated for the summer months (June, July, and August). Annual 
precipitation is projected to decline by 10-40 percent, including a 10-30 percent decrease during the wet season from 
October to April, and a 10 to 40 percent decrease during the dry season, from May to September. As a consequence, 
droughts and other extreme weather events will be increasing in frequency and intensity in Morocco. 
 
4. To address those challenges and to foster the structural transformation of the economy, the Government of 
Morocco has launched a number of ambitious sectoral programs. Those programs, which cover the main economic 
sectors including the agri-food sector through the Plan Maroc Vert (PMV), which aims to promote market-oriented 
agricultural growth, doubling sector value added and creating 1.5 million jobs, have started to generate results in terms 
of increased investments, growth and diversification within each sector. Considering the remaining challenges, however, 
and while pursuing its macroeconomic reform agenda, the Government of Morocco is now looking at ways to increase 
the impact of those sectoral programs on growth, income generation and employment creation. A new strategy for the 
agricultural sector, building on the achievements of the PMV will focus on creating a rural middle class with a strong focus 
on increasing human capital and ensuring the sustainable management of natural resources.

Sectoral (or multi-sectoral) and Institutional Context of the Program 
5. Morocco’s agri-food sector can contribute to economic growth, boost shared prosperity, and increase jobs, 
incomes, and livelihoods. The agri-food sector is a key growth area. The sector represents 15 percent of GDP, 23 percent 
of exports, and close to 30 percent of employment. From 2000 to 2015, the non-agriculture sector’s GDP grew at a slower 
rate than overall GDP, meaning that agricultural GDP was the fastest growing sector in Morocco (CEM, World Bank, 2016). 
Agriculture is the only source of employment and income for 80 percent of the rural labor force, hence growth in the 
sector results in substantial reductions of poverty rates. To ensure the sector’s continued performance and contribution 
to Morocco’s economic development, a stronger focus on job creation in agri-food value chains and on the sector’s 
resilience to climate change is needed. 

 
6. Increasing farm incomes and creating more and better rural jobs is a priority for Morocco’s agricultural 
transformation. Today, Morocco’s agricultural sector lies between the transition and urbanized agriculture stages in its 
agricultural transformation process.1 Hence, Morocco’s agriculture has yet to reach its full export and production 
potential, which could further boost shared prosperity in the country. Furthermore, Morocco is not tapping into the 
potential of its women and youth. Women are highly appreciated for their work ethic and rigor, but often lack access to 
the necessary assets such as extension services, finance or social security, which keeps them trapped in low-pay jobs. 
Morocco’s young population offers exceptional knowledge in new digital technologies but has difficulty in finding 
appropriate employment. Supporting growth in agri-food value chains—beyond agricultural production, and developing 
storage, processing, distribution, transport, logistics, retailing and other services—could ensure that Morocco’s food 
system increasingly contributes to job creation in the country. Furthermore, necessary policies and investments can 
improve the quality and quantity of jobs and facilitate the inclusion of more women and youth. 

 
7. The agri-food sector also needs to adapt to a rapidly changing climate. Moroccan agriculture is strongly exposed 
to climate change. With rising temperatures and high levels of water-stress, Morocco is likely to face longer and more 
frequent periods of drought over the coming decade, less predictable rainfall and more frequent extreme weather events. 
In addition, agriculture and land use activities represent a substantial share of greenhouse gas emissions, although their 
overall volume remains low. To ensure the sector’s sustainability, Morocco has incorporated the climate change issue into 
its development strategies in order to manage its impact and reduce vulnerabilities. Morocco’s vision is to make its 
territory and people more resilient to climate change while ensuring a rapid transition to a low carbon economy.  

 
8. Digital technologies offer solutions to the challenges faced by Moroccan agri-food value chains. Driven by both 
public and private sector, the digital transformation of Moroccan agriculture has begun. The sector is experiencing various 
digital improvements related to satellite imagery, internet and mobile phone-based technologies, IOT networks and E-
commerce platforms. The main examples of these digital solutions include: (i) Databases such as FERTIMAP2, Crop Growth 
Monitoring system (CGMS)3, Système d'information sur les prix des produits agricoles (ASAAR4), RNA (National Agriculture 

 
1 A country’s transition from an agriculture-based economy to a developed one can be broken down into five stages: (i) agri-based, (ii) pre-transition, (iii) transition, 
(iv) urbanised, and (v) developed. Policy priorities differ depending on where a country stands in the agricultural transition process. ‘Agricultural Transformation 

Process maps’ help decipher the different stages of agricultural development and where countries are located. Thes maps are created by taking into consideration (i) 

the percentage of farming jobs, and (ii) the primary agriculture’s share of total GDP and allow for the country categorization mentioned before. 

2 This provides (i) knowledge of soil fertility; and (ii) ad-hoc cost-effective fertilizing recommendations based on soil fertility map and soil sampling. The initiative runs 

on a GIS platform accessible online.  
3 It allows forecasting yields of cereals through (i) weather data processing (9km x 9km resolution); and (ii) simulation of crop growth. The platform is online

Registry)5, and ARDNA6; (ii) digital farm management services delivered to large cooperatives or producers/exporter 
associations7; (iii) a dynamic banking sector within which digital solutions (FinTech) are catching on8;  and (iv) E-commerce 
platforms that are starting to turn to food trade9. The digital transformation of agriculture in Morocco will require a 
significant effort in building domestic capacity to manage the access and use of data, build digital infrastructure in rural 
areas, improve the regulatory framework, foster the demand/adoption of digital solutions, boost the supply of technology 
by start-ups and SMEs, disseminate digital technical knowledge and improve academic currincula to address the market 
demand for digital expertise.  

 
9. The development of digital technologies in agri-food value chains will be underpinned by the overall digital 
economy.10 The Plan Maroc Numérique 2020 (Digital Morocco Plan) was developed by the Ministry of Industry, 
Commerce, Investment and the Digital Economy (MICIEN) and is the vision for the development of the digital economy in 
Morocco. This strategy aims by 2020 to digitize 50% of administrative procedures and bills, connect 20% of Moroccan 
SMEs, , and position Morocco as a digital hub. The transformation of the administration towards digital constitutes the 
backbone of this plan. The plan rests on three pillars i) Digital Transformation of the economy and national government, 
ii) Digital Hub for Africa, and iii) Digital Foundations including data infrastructure, digital skills and digital regulations and 
frameworks. In 2016, the Digital Development Agency (ADD), was created to undertake the implementation of the Plan 
Moroc Numeric 2020 and support the implementation and development of the digital economy, by encouraging the 
dissemination of digital tools and promoting their use among the population. The Digital Morocco Plan for 2020's major 
measures aim to authorize the entry of new players, to set up an investment-friendly legal and regulatory framework, and 
to use Public-Private Partnerships to deploy broadband infrastructure in areas that are less profitable for private 
investors.   

 

10. Digital Economy. Considering the current situation of broadband in Morocco, and the country's ambition to 
become a regional leader and to rise to the level of economic development of upper-middle income countries, the 
Moroccan government now faces the need to introduce a second wave of reforms in the broadband sector. Following the 
example of international best practices, Morocco should primarily strive to: (i) increase coverage for the remaining 40% 
of the population (who live in more remote, sparsely populated semi-urban and rural areas with poor and/or no 
profitability); (ii) encourage the arrival of new players (without limits on their numbers and without prohibiting 
infrastructure deployment) on all market segments (international gateways, backbones, backhauls, access); (iii) introduce 
regulation for open and non-discriminatory access to communications networks (wireline infrastructure, civil engineering 
and easements); (iv) promote private investment in telecommunications; and (v) improve regulatory framework for the

7 This is the case of AGRIDATA (http://agridata-consulting.com/en/ ) working with APEFEL (fruit and vegetable exporter association), Maroc Citrus (citrus exporter 

association) and COPAG (large cooperative active on dairy, meat, citrus and vegetables). 
8 Crédit Agricole du Maroc (CAM) stands out as it started the implementation of a “digital agenda” in 2011. 
9 Jumia is entering into niche products sold by cooperatives and is increasing its sales volumes of processed food for supermarkets.  
10 This is aligned with the Digital Economy for Africa (DE4A) Initiative, which aims to digitally connect every individual, business and government in Africa by 2030 and 
ensure that each person is digital-enabled and ready to thrive in the digital economy. This includes every farmer and agribusiness. In order to digitally enable the 

broader food system in Morocco, there needs to be a concentrated effort to build up the core foundations of the digital economy including digital infrastructure, digital 

platforms, digital skills, digital financial services and an environment supportive of digital business and entrepreneurship. A simultaneous effort will be needed to 

mitigate the growing risks of the digital era including cybersecurity, data privacy and protection and market concentration. This becomes relevant for the large portion 

of rural inhabitants in Morocco.

use of new digital technologies like IoT, Drones, Artificial intelligence key to the modernization and improvement of 
efficiency in the agriculture sector.11 

 
Relationship to CAS/CPF 

 
11. The proposed operation is fully aligned with the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) 2018-2024. In particular, 
it is aligned with Strategic Focus Area A (Promoting job creation by the private sector) and Strategic Focus Area 3 
(Promoting inclusive and resilient territorial development). Specifically, the proposed operation would support CPF 
Objective 2 (Increase opportunities for private sector growth with a focus on MSMEs and youth employability) as well as 
CPF Objective 10 (Strengthen adaptation to climate change and resilience to natural disasters). Under CPF Objective 2 the 
CPF foresees to crowd-in the private sector to generate further growth and job opportunities. Under CPF Objective 10 the 
CPF envisages to support climate adaptation and resilience in sectors threatened by climate variability and change. Yet, 
the activities of the operation will also indirectly touch upon Strategic Focus Area B (Strengthening human capital), as the 
Program aims at building, strengthening and protecting human capital by extending academic curricula and developing 
digital extension services. Given the strong focus on gender and digital technologies in the Program, the Cross-Cutting 
Themes ‘Gender’ and ‘Harnessing Digital Economy for Jobs and Faster Growth’ are equally broadly covered in the Program. 

 
12. The proposed operation also supports the new MENA Regional Strategy on Economic and Social Inclusion for 
Peace and Stability. In particular the Program is aligned with (i) Pillar 1 on Renewing the Social Contract as it emphasizes 
more inclusive economic growth and the protection of natural resources which are considered public goods to be 
preserved as part of the intergenerational social contract, and (ii) Pillar 2 on Strengthening Resilience to Shocks, such as 
climate shocks. The Program is also aligned with the new enlargement of the strategy which focuses on youth, 
entrepreneurship, and technologies. In particular, the Program touches upon (i) human capital development, and (ii) 
digital transformation. With respect to human capital development the Program focuses on improving the quality of 
extension services and access to the social protection systems. With respect to digital transformation, the Program aims 
at improving skills for youth and women, support entrepreneurship and SMEs, improve contestability in markets, including 
via disruptive technologies. The regional strategy has an equally strong focus on gender equality and female 
empowerment, which is clearly reflected in the operation. 

 
 
 
Rationale for Bank Engagement and Choice of Financing Instrument 

 
13. The World Bank has been engaged in the agricultural sector in Morocco for almost three decades and supported 
the PMV since its inception, through operations which have collectively built capacity and systems in the agriculture 
sector. This included: (a) a DPL series in support of the PMV (2011 to 2014, USD 408 million) with a focus on institutional 
and regulatory measures to – among others - improve the efficiency of domestic markets by reducing marketing costs and 
improving marketing services through the modernization of wholesale markets and slaughterhouses; improve the 
effectiveness of the agricultural innovation system; and establish an effective food safety management systems; and (b) 
two investment operations (Modernization of Irrigated Agriculture in Oum Er Rbia Basin Project, 2010-2017, US$ 70 million 
IBRD; Large Scale Irrigation Modernization Project, 2015-2022, US$150 million IBRD) with a focus on improving water 
service to small farmers in large scale irrigation perimeters as a prerequisite to the adoption of improved irrigation 

 
11 The Program will be able to build on and create synergies with other WB sector projects, such as (i) the ‘Financing Innovative Start-ups and Small and Medium 

Enterprises Project’ (P150928), which aimed at increasing private equity and quasi-equity finance for innovative startups and small and medium enterprises in Morocco, 

and (ii) the ‘Financial Inclusion and Digital Economy’ project (P 168587), which focuses on fostering financial inclusion and contributing to digital transformation for 

individuals, enterprises, and entrepreneurs.

technologies and increase in agricultural water productivity. Furthermore, a PforR supporting the PMV (2018-2022, US$ 
200 million IBRD) aims to increase the volume of added-value products commercialized in the olive and citrus agri-food 
value chains. In addition, sustainability of the agricultural sector in rainfed marginal areas has been addressed through 
two dedicated grants by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) (Integrating Climate Change in the Implementation of the 
Plan Maroc Vert Project, 2010-2015, US$4 million; and Social and Integrated Agricultural Project, 2013-2017, US$6 million) 
focusing on climate change adaptation, biodiversity and land conservation. The proposed operation would complement 
and build on these project experiences by putting a stronger focus on equity/job creation and resilience/environmental 
sustainability in agricultural value chains, while also ensuring the sustainability of the investments made in earlier 
projects/programs, in particular the irrigation IPFs. 

 
14. The GoM is now seeking assistance to support the development and implementation of the new phase of the 
PMV—a new agricultural strategy currently being finalized. The GoM has demonstrated its commitment to results and 
reforms through the implementation of the PMV and the development of the new agricultural successor program of the 
PMV, which will be finalized in September 2019. During the preparation of the CPF 2019-2024, the MAPMDREF has asked 
for the continuous support of the World Bank to strengthen its agriculture sector by leveraging digital and climate smart 
technologies. On January 29, 2019, the GoM officially solicited World Bank financing and technical assistance to implement 
the new agricultural strategy. The request also stressed two angles to design the support: digital technologies and climate 
smart agriculture.  

 
15. The final choice of the instrument will be made during project preparation and appraisal.  
 
C. Program Development Objective(s) (PDO) and PDO Level Results Indicators 
 
Program Development Objective(s) 
 
The Morocco Digital and Climate Smart Agriculture Program aims at increasing the adoption of digital and climate-
smart technologies in agri-food value chains in Morocco. 

 
PDO Level Results Indicators 
 
At PDO-level, it is proposed that the following three indicators would be used to assess the PDO results: 
 

• Number of farmers and agri-food SMEs adopting climate-smart technologies and practices;  

• Number of farmers and agri-food SMEs adopting digital technologies.  
 
D. Program Description 

 
 

 
16. The Government’s program is the next phase of the Plan Maroc Vert (PMV). The proposed projectwill focus on 2 
key areas of the Governement’s program: the diffusion and adoption of i) climate smart technologies and practices and ii) 
digital technologies in agri-food value chain. The Program will mainly focus on building the ecosystem and setting up the 
incentive schemes to enable the private sector to provide digital and climate smart technologies and farmers and agri-
food SMEs to adopt them. The increased adoption of these technologies will transform the Moroccan agri-food sector and 
will contribute to reaching the higher-level objectives of the new strategy: i) Creating jobs in rural areas (especially for the 
youth and women); and ii) Managing natural resources in a sustainable and climate-resilient way.

17. The PMV was launched in 2008 to modernize and foster the growth of the agri-food sector. The PMV aims to 
transform the agri-food sector into a key source of economic growth that contributes to employment creation and poverty 
reduction in rural areas, while promoting the sector’s integration into the global economy, and helping the sector adapt 
to climate change. The PMV includes a set of transversal institutional reforms, as well as an investment support program 
based on public-private partnerships. At sub-sector level, specific targets and actions have also been jointly negotiated 
between MAPMDREF, the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and representatives of the private sector 
(Interprofessions) through Contrat-Programmes (CPs, result-based agreements) in 19 sub-sectors. For each action, the 
CPs define the respective contributions of the public and the private sectors. The PMV has also been translated into 
agricultural development plans endorsed by each region. 
 
 
 
E. Initial Environmental and Social Screening 
 
18. In terms of environmental and social risk management,  the concept stage examination of potentially critical 
aspects based on the PforR E&S tool for initial screening of types of risks shows that:  
 

a) Environmental and social risks: Initial assessments show that social and environmental risks are expected to be 
moderate, and that E&S management capacities are likely to be adequate to manage risks related to the social and 
environmental context of the project. In accordance with OP 9.00 the project would not finance activities expected to 
have significant adverse impacts that are sensitive, diverse, or unprecedented on the environment and/or affected people. 
The project’s operation proposals will be screened during program preparation and implementation for such adverse 
impacts. If such activities are likely to occur within the project, they should be excluded from PforR support. An 
Environmental and Social Systems Assessment (ESSA) will be conducted during preparation to ensure E&S risk 
management capacities are adequate, that screening capacities are adequate, and that eventual gaps are mitigated during 
implementation. In fact, the project is likely to yield important benefits for producers and processors in selected sub-
sectors, both through its institutional strengthening activities and the specific investments to be financed. Physical 
investments are expected to have no negative social impacts in terms of resettlement and land acquisition, while they 
may yield environmental benefits, particularly by developing climate-smart value-chains and improved environmental 
management practices. Overall impacts are expected to be positive, through improved environmental management 
practices along value-chains, and increased capacity and economic returns for beneficiaries;  

 
b) Capacity of National Systems: Morocco has a legal framework in place for environmental and social management and 
impact assessments, and reliable country systems to manage the risks associated with project activities. The key legislative 
text is Law no. 12-03 of May 12, 2003, aimed at minimizing the negative impact of projects and improving ecological 
sustainability. Regarding land tenure, the protection of property is ensured by Article 35 of the new Constitution of 2011 
and implemented through numerous laws. The Constitution also establishes equality, inclusiveness, participation (art 136, 
139), including disclosure and consultation processes, the right of petition, grievance redress mechanisms as well as citizen 
engagement (art 19, 136, 139, 156). Moreover, Morocco has adopted in March 2014 a National Charter of the 
Environment and Sustainable Development. As the main beneficiaries of the Program include farmers, SMEs and 
agribusinesses, it will be important for project design to identify cultural, social, economic, geographical and political 
constraints to equitable access to project benefits, giving special attention to the needs and concerns of women, youth 
and the most vulnerable groups. Some specific weaknesses still do exist and will have to be managed through the ESSA 
and Program Action Plans; for instance, timely compensation in cases of land acquisition. The need for coordination of 
safeguards standards and procedures across a number of agencies executing program activities deserves particular

attention. Any specific weaknesses pertaining to the execution of the project’s activities will be the subject of corrective 
actions recommended in the Program Action Plan; 
 
c) Reputational and political risk: The PMV is not seen to be a controversial program and has been widely supported by 
beneficiaries. Program assessment should review both the overall decision-making processes and allocation of resources 
to strengthen social inclusiveness (e.g., ensuring that women, youth, and vulnerable groups at least have a fair opportunity 
to benefit from the Program). The primary reputational risk to the Bank is that the Program may not deliver the scope and 
scale of benefits envisioned, or that the explicitly environmental and social aspects of the program development objective 
cause the program to somehow become associated with broader social or political protest causes.

I. Project Context
Country Context
Ethiopia is a large and diverse country. It is land-locked and located in the Horn of Africa, with an 
area of 1.1 million km2. Its bio-physical environment includes a variety of ecosystems, with 
significant differences in climate, soil properties, vegetation types, and agricultural potential, 
biodiversity and water resources. Ethiopia is a country of many nations, nationalities and peoples, 
with a total population of 91.7 million (2012).  Only 17 percent of the population lives in urban 
centres, the great majority of them in Addis Ababa. At a current annual growth rate of 2.6 percent, 
Ethiopia’s population is estimated to reach 130 million by 2025, and is projected by the UN to be 
among the world’s ten largest countries by 2050. Ethiopia is vulnerable to terms of trade shocks 
from international food and fuel prices, and to large domestic weather-related shocks as 
demonstrated by the 2011/12 East Africa drought. 
 
Ethiopia has a federal, democratic government system, established in the early 1990s, with nine 
autonomous states (‘regions’) and two chartered cities. Decentralization of governance to the

regional and district (woreda) levels has been actively pursued since 2003. The Ethiopian People’s 
Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) has been in power in Ethiopia since 1991. EPRDF 
comprises four regionally-based parties from the four major regions (Amhara, Oromia, Southern 
Nations, Nationalities and Peoples (SNNPR), and Tigray). The long-serving Prime Minister, Meles 
Zenawi, (from Tigray) died in August 2012 and was succeeded by Hailemariam Desalegn (from 
SNNPR) who has pursued largely the same policies. The next national elections are scheduled for 
2015. 
 
Ethiopia has experienced strong economic growth over the past decade. Economic growth averaged 
10.7 percent per year in 2003/04 to 2011/12, compared to the regional average of 5.0 percent. 
Growth reflected a mix of factors, including agricultural modernization, the development of new 
export sectors, strong global commodity demand, and government-led development investments. 
Private consumption and public investment have driven demand side growth, with the latter 
assuming an increasingly important role in recent years. On the supply side, growth was driven by 
an expansion of the services and agricultural sectors, while the role of the industrial sector was 
relatively modest. Recently, annual growth rates have declined slightly, but still remain at high 
single-digit levels. Growth in the export of goods has also moderated in recent years and a decline 
was observed in 2012/13 for the first time since 2008/09. There have been bouts of high inflation in 
recent years and, while inflation is currently much lower, keeping it down remains a major 
objective for monetary policy. 
 
Ethiopia is one of the world's poorest countries, but has made substantial progress on social and 
human development over the past decade. The country’s per capita income of US$470  is 
substantially lower than the regional average of US$1,257 and among the ten lowest worldwide. 
Ethiopia is ranked 173 out of 187 countries in the Human Development Index (HDI) of the United 
Nations Development Program (UNDP). High economic growth, however, has helped reduce 
poverty in both urban and rural areas. Since 2005, 2.5 million people have been lifted out of 
poverty, and the share of the population below the poverty line has fallen from 38.7 percent in 
2004/05 to 29.6 percent in 2010/11  (using a poverty line of close to US$1.25/day). However, 
because of high population growth, the absolute number of poor (about 25 million) has remained 
unchanged over the past fifteen years. Ethiopia is among the countries that have made the fastest 
progress on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and HDI ranking over the past decade. It 
is on track to achieve the MDGs for gender parity in education, child mortality, HIV/AIDS, and 
malaria. Good progress has been made in universal primary education, although the MDG target 
may not be met. Reduction of maternal mortality remains a key challenge. 
 
GoE is currently implementing its ambitious Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP; 
2010/11-2014/15), which sets a long-term goal of becoming a middle-income country by 2025, 
with growth rates of at least 11.2 percent per annum during the plan period. To achieve the GTP 
goals and objectives, GoE has followed a “developmental state” model with a strong role for the 
government in many aspects of the economy. It has prioritized key sectors such as industry and 
agriculture as drivers of sustained economic growth and job creation. The GTP also reaffirms 
GoE’s commitment to human development. Development partners have programs that are broadly 
aligned with GTP priorities. 
 
The World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, FY13-16) builds on the progress 
achieved by Ethiopia in recent years and aims to help GoE address structural transformation and 
assist in the implementation of the GTP. The CPS framework includes two pillars. Pillar One,

“Fostering competitiveness and employment”, aims to support Ethiopia in achieving: (i) a stable 
macroeconomic environment; (ii) increased competitiveness and productivity; (iii) increased and 
improved delivery of infrastructure; and (iv) enhanced regional integration.  Pillar Two, “Enhancing 
resilience and reducing vulnerabilities”, aims to support Ethiopia in improving the delivery of social 
services and developing a comprehensive approach to social protection and risk management. Good 
governance and state building form the foundation of the CPS. In line with the GTP, gender and 
climate change have been included as cross-cutting issues to strengthen their mainstreaming across 
the portfolio. The programs of IFC and MIGA are well aligned with the CPS framework, 
contributing mainly to the strategic objectives under Pillar One.

  

Sectoral and institutional Context
The agricultural sector remains a dominant sector in the Ethiopian economy and an important 
source of economic growth. Although there is an on-going structural transformation in the 
Ethiopian economy, predominantly from agriculture to services and manufacturing, agriculture still 
comprises 45 percent of total output and continues to dominate employment (78 percent). The 
sector is also a major contributor to export earnings, with over 80 percent of goods exports. Despite 
its declining share in the economy, the agriculture sector is growing rapidly. Over the past 15 years 
the average rate of growth has been around seven percent per year according to official statistics. 
Sources of growth have come from an increased area under cultivation and from increased 
productivity, the latter driven by large public investment in the sector, including agricultural 
extension, rural roads, and advances in public policy such as improvements in land tenure security. 
In addition to contributing to economic output and exports, agricultural growth is correlated with 
poverty reduction, for smallholder farmers and also through positive impacts on non-farm rural 
economies. 
 
Although Ethiopia has a trend of negative overall balance of trade, the country has consistently had 
a positive balance of trade in the agriculture sector. The agriculture imports per capita and exports 
per capita stood at $13.28 and $18.27 respectively in 2011. The top three agriculture exports have 
been coffee, oil seeds and pulses while the largest imports have been cereals, edible oils and sugar. 
In spite of the positive trade balances in the sector, marketing (including intra-regional trade) in the 
sector is constrained by mixed and often unfavorable policies for input and output markets and poor 
infrastructure leading to high transportation costs. There remains considerable potential for both 
increased exports from the sector and further import substitution, especially for cereals 
(predominantly wheat) and sugar.   
 
The further growth of the agriculture sector is expected to feature prominently in the second phase 
of the GTP (GTP-II), currently under preparation.  Maintaining the current growth rate in the sector 
will be challenging as recent gains from land expansion may be exhausted, and further increases 
will need to come from increased agricultural productivity. Progress requires both investment and 
policy reform.  The general thrust on policy reform is to pursue agricultural transformation by 
increasing private sector investment and value added in the country to increase the value of exports. 
In 2012, the Government agreed a G8 New Alliance framework for Ethiopia with a number of 
commitments for policy actions to facilitate the expansion of private investment.  Under this 
framework, the Government intends to focus its efforts in particular on: i) increasing stability and 
transparency in trade policy; ii) improving incentives for the private sector investment; iii) 
developing and implementing a transparent land tenure policy; and iv) developing and 
implementing domestic seed policies that encourage increased private sector involvement in this

area. To support the transformation agenda, the Government established the Agricultural 
Transformation Agency (ATA) in 2011 to support the Ministry of Agriculture to advance policy 
and build capacity.  Notable achievements include the new Agricultural Cooperatives Development 
Strategy and the passing of the Seeds Proclamation. 
 
The Government’s agricultural development strategy focuses on both encouraging large scale 
investment in commercial agriculture and support to smallholder farmers, who in 2012/13 
contributed 96 percent of the total agricultural production according to official statistics. To 
increase agricultural productivity of smallholders and their transformation to commercial farmers 
requires a strengthening and focusing of support services and infrastructure, and greater private 
investment to support input and output value chains.  To drive this transformation, the Government 
is moving towards focused support to specific commercialization clusters targeting areas with the 
highest potential for the production of commodities for which Ethiopia has a comparative 
advantage and can stimulate agro-processing and value addition.   
 
Despite the large investment into public agricultural services, especially into extension, which has 
seen a rapid rise in the number of extension workers and beneficiaries served year on year, there are 
capacity weaknesses which continue to inhibit the identification and dissemination of technologies 
to support increased productivity.  Strengthening research and extension linkages, further expansion 
and capacity of the extension service and enhancing farmer access to inputs are required to support 
investments in extension workers.  Improving agriculture research has been prioritized in GTP and 
the same is expected in GTP II because of the pivotal role it plays to improve agricultural 
productivity and production and recognizing that in recent years it has been underfunded.  Animal 
health and production services also suffer from capacity limitations and low outreach, leading to 
low productivity and quality across a range of animal products.  
 
Access to and application of agricultural inputs is a decisive factor to improve agricultural 
productivity and production.  In addition to improved seeds, animal breeds and fertilizers, there is 
considerable opportunity to promote the use of machinery for production and post-harvest 
activities.  Innovations such as row planters for teff have had a considerable impact on productivity. 
However, input markets in Ethiopia are typically overly dependent on cooperative unions and the 
agro-dealer market is small and underdeveloped.  While cooperatives can play an important role in 
linking smallholder farmers to input and output markets, they are often hampered by weak 
management and facilities, and currently only handle a small percentage of agricultural output.  
There is potential for strengthening cooperatives while also enabling greater private engagement in 
both input and output markets.  
 
Output marketing system and infrastructure in Ethiopia are dominated by traditional, informal 
exchanges. For a large part of the country, this means trading with limited infrastructure. There are 
few market structures, storage, loading and unloading facilities, quality checking and banking 
services in or around most of the market centers. This has resulted in the cost of trading being very 
high due to cumbersome conditions for transaction, low product qualities and post-harvest losses.  
Value chains (other than for coffee which has a relatively efficient market structures) are therefore 
characterized by an absence of market participants, market inefficiencies and limited value addition. 
With increasing agricultural surpluses, rapid urbanization and increased opportunities for agro-
industrial investment, there are gaps in the current functioning in a number of value chains which 
are prioritized under the commercialization cluster approach to achieving transformation.

Agricultural water development is crucial to improve smallholders’ livelihood and income in 
Ethiopia, since irrigation can help farmers increase their crop production, increase crop varieties, 
and lengthen their agricultural seasons. From a very low base, over the next five years there are 
targets to increase the total area of irrigated land from the current 640,000 hectares (about 4 percent 
of currently cultivated land) to about 1.8 million hectares. Small Scale Irrigation (SSI) and Rain 
Water Harvesting (RWH) will account for about two-thirds of this expansion, as these technologies 
require lower capital and technical investments and they are possible on small plain areas. Beyond 
the next five years, plans are to reach the full irrigable potential of the country of over 5 million 
hectares. Household irrigation as well as medium- and large-scale schemes will be an important 
strategy to achieve this goal, in combination with exploring and developing groundwater potential, 
especially given that an estimated 85 percent of Ethiopia’s total surface water irrigation potential is 
estimated to be in large-scale schemes.  
 
Future agricultural growth needs t o be sensitive to gender.  On average, female farm managers in 
Ethiopia produce 23 percent less (in terms of gross value of output) per hectare than their male 
counterparts. Differences in both the levels of productive factors used and the returns that these 
factors generate drive this gender gap. Future inclusive agricultural growth should consider: (i) the 
promotion of labor-saving technologies for women; (ii) the provision of relevant information to 
female farmers, customized to the needs of female farmers; and (iii) the easing of the time burden 
of household responsibilities, by providing services to reduce the time that female farmers need to 
perform household duties to enable them to devote more time to productive farm activities. Recent 
research demonstrates the potential of women to contribute to agricultural growth and improve 
outcomes, including improved nutrition.   
 
In Ethiopia, forty percent of children under the age of five suffer from stunting as a consequence of 
chronic and cyclical malnutrition. The National Nutrition Program (NNP) was revised in 2013 to 
strategically address the nutrition problem in the country to include initiatives that have emerged 
since the 2008 NNP, including taking into account the multisectoral and multidimensional nature of 
nutrition and the linkages among key implementing sectors, one being agriculture.  This program, 
endorsed by the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Health and another eight line Ministers, 
includes a strategic objective to strengthen implementation of nutrition sensitive interventions in the 
agriculture sector. The initiatives focus on improving the consumption of diversified diets at the 
household level through: (i) diversification of crop, fruits and livestock production; (ii) promotion 
of appropriate technologies for food production and processing through the handling, preparation 
and preservation for food diversification to ensure nutritious food utilization;  (iii) building the 
capacity of Development Agents (DAs) at community level and agriculture program managers at all 
levels to implement nutrition sensitive agriculture;  (iv) supporting local complementary food 
production and creating economic opportunities for women through development groups and 
cooperatives; and, (v) supporting agricultural research centers to develop seeds of high nutritional 
value.  Thus, it calls for aligning the agricultural growth programs to improve nutritional status. 
 
With the limits of bringing uncultivated land under production being met, the likelihood of climatic 
variability and the potential degradation arising from more intensive production practices increases, 
and thus there is an urgent need for agriculture to conserve resources and reduce degradation. In 
recent years, considerable amount of work in natural resource conservation and development work 
has been undertaken. In 2013/14 alone, the communities undertook natural resources conservations 
work on 20.15 million hectares of land throughout the country, according to official statistics.  This 
current momentum of community mobilization in natural resource conservation by pursuing

activities such as slope stabilization, watershed approaches to water management and reduction of 
tillage should be sustained to make the sector more resilient and sustainable. 
 
The opportunities for inclusive and sustainable growth in the sector are strong as is the 
Government’s commitment to achieving ambitious growth and transformation targets.  The 
Agricultural Sector Policy and Investment Framework (PIF), 2010 – 2020, provides an investment 
framework to align the investment and policy priorities with higher level goals to transform the 
sector and is designed to operationalize the CAADP Compact signed by the Government and its 
development partners. Under the PIF, there have been concerted efforts to collaborate and partner 
on investments and the Agricultural Growth Project (AGP I – P113032) was a clear output of this. 
The first phase of the program was financed to around US$350 million, including US$150 million 
from IDA, US$50 million from the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP), a US
$50 million Multi-donor Trust Fund with contributions from the Netherlands, Canada and Spain, 
and parallel financing from USAID and Italy.  Currently, AGPI operates at  kebele levels (the 
lowest administrative unit) in 96 woredas of the four regions of Amhara, Oromia, SNNPR and 
Tigray and has provided support for improved public agricultural service provision, technology 
transfer, improved market access and marketing, infrastructure (household and small-scale 
irrigation, feeder roads and market centers) and capacity building.  The project further explicitly 
aims to increase the participation of women and youth in the sector.  The proposed project therefore 
aims to build on AGP1, to scale up the geographical extent, consolidate the investments, and meet 
the emerging challenges of the sector outlines above. 
 
Under AGPI, the project has been operating in 4 regions (Amhara, Oromia, SNNP and Tigray), 96 
woredas and 2,423 kebeles, targeting 1.57 million direct beneficiaries.  The AGP2 project would 
cover 157 woredas, which would include all woredas targeted under AGP1 plus an additional 61. 
The woredas are distributed among the following regions: Amhara, Oromia, SNNPR, Tigray, 
Benshangul-Gumuz, Gambella, Harari and Dire Dawa Administrative Council. The expansion into 
the new regions and Dire Dawa would be on a limited scale, with two woredas in each of 
Benshangul-Gumuz and Gambella, and one in each of Harari and Dire Dawa.

responsibilities, the MoA will use - or will establish in the new targeted regions - the institutional 
mechanisms already established for AGP 1 at Federal, Regional, and Woreda levels, i.e: (i) the 
Steering Committees (SCs), (ii) the Technical Committees (TCs), and (iii) the Project’s 
Coordination Units (CUs). The existing composition of these Committees will be reviewed in order 
to include new implementing agencies such as the Ethiopian Institute for Agricultural Research 
(EIAR). At the Zonal level, the Zonal Agriculture Office (ZAO) will provide technical support, 
extension services and M&E to the group of woredas under its authority. The ZAOs will coordinate 
with the Woreda Offices of Agriculture (WOA). 
 
Implementation of the project will be decentralized. Federal implementing agencies will provide 
guidance and support to regions, spearhead most institutional capacity building activities and 
undertake monitoring, evaluation and communication activities. At regional and woreda levels, the 
Bureaus/Offices of Agriculture will assume primary responsibility for execution of the project.  
Implementation of AGP at the regional level will also be supported by relevant service providers 
and institutions.  
 
The annual planning process will follow a two-pronged approach associating: (i) a demand-driven 
approach based on the Community Level Participatory Planning (CLPP) approach adopted for AGP-
I in which communities are assuming primary responsibility for identifying and executing the 
community-based investment of the project, and (ii) a strategic-based approach in which 
investments are pre-identified through the Kebele, Woreda and Regional development plan or 
through specific feasibility studies, and implemented in close collaboration with the community 
after a consultation process. At the woreda and kebele levels, the implementation of the project 
would be undertaken jointly by Woreda Office of Agriculture through the Woreda Development 
Committee (WDC), the Kebele Development Committee (KDC), and the communities. The WDC 
and the KDC will be guided by their respective SCs and TCs.

B. Introduction and Context 
 
Country Context 
 
Ethiopia, with a current estimated population of 102.4 million1 (2016), has seen rapid economic growth over the past 
decade and is one of the fastest growing economies in the World. The IMF predicted the growth rate of Ethiopia to be 
8.5 percent in 20182.  The rapid economic growth over the past decade3 has not been able to generate adequate 
employment opportunities and Ethiopia needs to generate 1.7 million jobs4 every year to provide gainful employment 
to youth who are entering workforce. The arid and semi-arid low-lands, accounting for 60 percent of land area with 12 
to 14 percent of population, comprising of pastoral and agro-pastoral (PAP) communities lag behind in most of the 
social and economic indicators and their livelihoods are highly vulnerable to a multitude of shocks, primarily droughts, 
which is being exacerbated by climate change.  

 
 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 
 
The pastoral and agro-pastoral system are complex systems that need to balance the dynamic interplay between

people, livestock and environment resource base. The complexity of these livelihood system is getting exacerbated, 
driven by multiple factors droughts, degradation of rangelands, active conflict and insecurity, constrained livestock 
mobility and access to key resources etc. All these changes are resulting in significant changes in PAP production and 
livelihood systems. The commercialization pull is resulting into a category of commercially oriented large-scale herd 
owners who are successfully managing the transition. The stress-push has resulted into a category of population who 
has moved-out of pastoralism either being forced out by successive droughts or opting out since the pastoral livelihood 
is no longer viable or being pulled-in towards other market opportunities. Despite the complexity and high stress 
environment, there are significant economic opportunities in the pastoral and agro-pastoral areas and a significant 
proportion of population is still engaged in pastoral and agro-pastoral systems while others are pursing alternate 
livelihood opportunities.  

 
 
Relationship to CPF 
 
The operation features in the Bank’s CPF for FY 17-21 under the Building Resilience and Inclusiveness Pillar. In addition, 
it strongly contributes to “Promoting Structural and Economic Transformation through Increased Productivity’ pillar.  
The project will contribute to CPF result framework targets of enhance resilience, increase in agricultural yield, job 
creation, natural resource management, climate co-benefits, improved service delivery, as well as Ethiopia’s targets of 
National Adaptation Plan and Second Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP-2).  

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s)  

 
 
To Enhance Livelihood Resilience and Commercialization of the Production Systems among PAP Communities in 
Ethiopia.  
 

 
Key Results (From PCN) 

 
The key PDO level Indicators includes:  

1. Number of direct project beneficiary (disaggregated by gender)  
2. People provided with access to improved Economic and Social services (disaggregated by service type and 

gender)  
3. Proportion (volume and value) of production sold by targeted beneficiaries for selected products  
4. Range and agricultural land area (in HA) under improved natural resource management practices 
5. Percentage increase in yield of selected crop and livestock commodities  
6. Jobs created (disaggregated by gender) 

 
 
D. Concept Description 

 
A comprehensive and integrated approach, rather than discrete interventions, that addresses multiple dimensions of 
livelihood is needed to address the binding constraints described above. By understanding the needs of different 
beneficiary groups, pastoralists, agro-pastoralists, and households pursing or intending to pursue alternate livelihoods, 
and designing intervention packages to meet their specific needs, this project aims to support livelihood resilience and 
commercialization through the following project components. The project would invest in improving the overall

enabling environment of rangeland management, pastoral risk management, and institutional development and 
capacity building which will contribute to increased resilience of the PAP communities and production systems.  To 
improve livelihoods, the project would support improving productivity and commercialization of pastoral and agro-
pastoral production system, small scale irrigation in lowland areas, and promoting livelihood diversification. To project 
would support improving access and utilization of basic social and economic services among the target communities 
through a decentralized Community Driven Development approach, which will be complimented by a strategic inter-
community, and inter woreda investments with the purpose of improving prevention and preparedness against 
disasters.  

 
    

  SAFEGUARDS 

 
A. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known) 

 
The project will be implemented in the Pastoral and agro-pastoral areas of Ethiopia. The geographical coverage of the 

project would include regions of Afar, Ethio-Somali, Oromia and SNNPP. 
 
B. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 

 
The borrower has implemented a number of Bank projects and have moderate institutional capacity for implementing 

safeguard policies.The project implementation arrangements will largely follow the existing mechanisms for the ongoing 
PCDP III with slight modifications to capture recent developments. 
While implementing various World Bank Financed infrastructure projects (PCDP I-PCDP III), the Borrower has gained 

experiences in preparing safeguards instruments (ESMF, RPF, ESS and ESMP documents) to identify and address potential 
environmental and social risks. The Ministry of Federal and Pastoral Development Affairs (MoFPDA) has implemented 
three successive phases of Pastoral Community Development Project (PCDP) under an Adaptable Programme Lending 
(APL) spanning 15 years, which has been jointly supported by the World Bank and IFAD. It is, therefore, proposed that this 
new LRCP will utilize the existing experience that has been built up with the ongoing PCDP III safeguard implementation 
arrangements. MoFPDA has the responsibility for overall coordination, monitoring and evaluation of the LRCP. Currently, 
there are safeguards specialists dedicated for PCDP III at federal and the four regional bureau levels. However, if 
Gambella and Benishagul regions will be benefited from the proposed project they are required to deploy safeguards 
experts before commencement of the project. 
Experiences revealed that proper implementation and documentation of safeguards related matters still remains a 

challenge that needs to be further strengthened, through ensuring adequate personnel and capacity at the ministerial 
and local levels, to ensure environmental and social safeguards compliance.

Safeguard Policies Triggered? Explanation (Optional) 

Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 Yes 

The Livelihoods Resilience and Commercialization 
Project (LRCP) is expected to finance the following 
activities: pasture development, supporting area 
enclosures, Prosopis and other invasive species 
control, water resource development along cattle 
corridors, soil and water conservation measures, 
afforestation activities, small dams, flood control, rain 
water harvesting, breed improvement, feed/forage 
improvement and management, animal health 
services, rain-fed agriculture, build demand-driven 
social and economic infrastructure; which may include 
schools, health posts, veterinary posts, small water 
supply and irrigation, small feeder roads, catchment 
management improvements. Given that most of the 
aforementioned activities result in environmental and 
social risks, an environmental and social assessment is 
necessary; ergo OP/BP 4.01 will be triggered. The 
assessment will be outlined in an Environmental and 
Social Framework to be updated prior to appraisal and 
key resullts and measures will be integrated into the 
project documents (PAD, PIM, ESMF, etc.). Further, 
site specific ESIA, ESMP and PMP will also be prepared, 
as required, during project prepation.  

Performance Standards for Private Sector 
Activities OP/BP 4.03 

No 

The Project is being implemented by the Ministry of 
Agriculture. In case of any linkages to private sector 
via the commercialization component of the Project, 
these will be handled via OP 4.01. 

Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04 Yes 

Pastoral areas cover some natural habitats which are 
protected by law, such as the Awash and Yangudi Rasa 
National Parks (Afar), Yabello Sanctuary (Borena) and 
the Babile Wildlife Sanctuary (Somali). However, LRCP 
is not expected to be operated within such areas or 
other areas that qualify as critical natural habitats 
under OP. 4.04 or include any sub-projects that have a 
bearing on protected areas. However, it will affect 
rangelands and pastures, for which OP/BP 4.04 will 
apply to protect even those non-critical natural 
habitats from any adverse impacts. 

Forests OP/BP 4.36 Yes 

OP/BP 4.36 is triggered to avoid any anticipated 
potential impacts that may affect the natural forests 
found in Gambella and Benishangul Gumuze regions. 
Besides, LRCP is expected to finance afforestation and 
other natural resources management (range land 
management, area enclosure, …) related activities for

(P164336) 

 

 

  
Jun 07, 2018 Page 7 of 10  

     

which OP/BP 4.36 would apply. 

Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes 

Promotion of rain fed and/or irrigated farming where 
feasible and profitable is part of promoting sustainable 
livelihoods and may indirectly involve use of 
agrochemicals including fertilizers and pesticides for 
both crop and livestock improvements. The ESMF will 
include guidelines and procedures for the preparation 
of specific PMPs, when is required, during the project 
implementation. 

Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11 Yes 

There are few areas in the Ethiopian lowlands that 
may constitute physical cultural resources in the sense 
described in BP/OP. 4.11. Although the nature and 
scope of the LRCP sub-projects is not known now, they 
are unlikely to involve any major excavation work or 
inundation of areas with water, and are thus not likely 
to affect any physical cultural resources. Furthermore, 
subprojects will be carried out only in areas selected, 
through a broader consultative process that includes 
prior informed consent, by local citizens who would 
normally give great importance to safeguarding their 
cultural resources. Nonetheless, the policy is triggered, 
predicated on the assumption that there could be 
“chance find”. No sub-project that might have 
negative impacts on cultural property will be funded 
without acceptable mitigation measures prepared 
prior to execution of any such sub-project. There are 
national procedures and guidelines for reporting 
chance finds to be followed, and a national entity for 
coordinating and facilitating the archiving, safekeeping 
and documentation of physical cultural resources. The 
Project would work closely with the national authority, 
should any chance find issues arise. The requirements 
and standard measures of a chance-find procedure 
will also be included in the ESMF.  

Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 Yes 

The Project triggers OP 4.10 as the vast majority of 
people in the project area meet the criteria for OP 
4.10, with the project explicitly targeting lowlands in 
emerging regions. While the Project therefore will 
benefit specifically these areas, assessing culturally 
appropriate interventions as well as ensuring equal 
access to project benefits, a related Social Assessment 
shall be conducted and respective results integrated 
into the Project design. The SA will contain an explicit 
Social Development Plan and the Project will integrate 
the required measures into the PAD as well as

allocating ressources to ensure its implementation. 
Consequently it will also be addressed in the PIM and 
the ESMG. 

Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12 Yes 

LRCP interventions may involve acquisition of land and 
/or restriction of access to communal natural 
resources. Therefore, an RPF has to be prepared to 
ensure that appropriate measures are in place to 
address any issues which might arise from potential 
land acquisition and or restriction of access to 
communal natural resources under the Project. This 
RPF shall include appropriate tools to address 
potential impacts by a large number of sub-projects. 

Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes 

LRCP is not expected to finance any investments 
aimed at rehabilitating or constructing large dams. 
Although there could possibly be construction of small 
dams under LRCP, particularly for small scale 
irrigation, they may not be large (more than 4.5 
meters high) and therefore may not require special 
procedures that are normally applied for large dams to 
follow. This notwithstanding, the Project will trigger 
OP 4.37 (Safety of Dams). In cases of small dams 
construction (less than 4.5 meters), the Project will 
use the FAO ‘Manual on Small Earth Dams, A Guide to 
Siting, Design and Construction’. In addition, the 
guideline for small dam construction prepared by the 
MoA will be used to ensure safety of small dams. 
Generic dam safety measures designed by qualified 
engineers will be included in the design and 
implementation/rehabilitation of small dams; with 
respective requirements outlined in the ESMF. 

Projects on International Waterways 
OP/BP 7.50 

Yes 

LRCP could extract very small amounts of water from 
any of the shared rivers or drainage systems. This 
notwithstanding, the Project will, in accordance with 
the requirements of the policy, send renewal 
notification of intended water use to the relevant 
riparian countries. 

Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60 No 
The project is not expected to be implemented in any 
disputed areas.

 2. Project Development Objective(s) 

 

A. Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) - The PDO of the Enhancing Shared Prosperity 

through Equitable Services (ESPES) program is to improve equitable access to basic services and 

strengthen accountability systems at the decentralized level. The program is anchored around four sets 

of key results: (a) ensuring equitable access to basic services; (b) enhancing citizens’ engagement, 

environmental and social risk management capacity; (c) deepening fiduciary aspects of basic service 

delivery; and (d) ensuring quality data access and results.

 B. Proposed Project Development Objectives - Additional Financing (AF) 

 The PDO of the ESPES AF remains the same as the parent program. 

 3. Project Description 

 

ESPES supports Ethiopia’s Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer Program (woreda block grant system) 

which provides funding to close to one thousand woredas all over the country which are responsible for 

delivering basic services in health, education, agriculture, water and rural roads. The block grant 

program is a decentralized system of governance that supports flows of information, resources and 

accountability between different levels of government and between service providers and citizens. This 

system has been found to be effective in improving equitable access to services as indicated in the 

Systematic Country Diagnostic, the Poverty Assessment and the technical assessment undertaken as 

part of the preparation of the ESPES. Government ownership and commitment to the program also 

continues to be very strong. 

 

This proposed additional financing is sought to help finance the expenditures associated with the 

Government of Ethiopia’s Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer Program which provides block grants to 

region and woreda levels for delivering Basic Social Services such as health care, education, agriculture 

services, rural roads, and water and sanitation. The additional financing would (a) scale up existing 

Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) DLR targets; and (b) introduce new DLIs especially in the areas 

of citizen engagement and fiduciary management. Alongside the AF, the operation is also being 

restructured into a hybrid PforR to include an investment component to provide capacity building 

support for citizen engagement, fiduciary management, environmental and social safeguards 

management systems (ESMS), improved data production and dissemination, and program management. 

Performance of the operation has been satisfactory over the last 12 months. The closing date will also 

need to be extended from May 1, 2019 to December 31, 2022 to cover the implementation of the new 

DLIs and the capacity building component. 

 

The objective of the system strengthening and capacity building Investment Project Financing (IPF) 

Component is to improve the Government’s federal, regional and woreda level administrative systems 

for implementing and monitoring the block grant program, thereby improving the efficiency and 

effectiveness of the country in delivering basic services to all woredas. For instance, the safeguards 

capacity building element is relevant to all sectors because the woredas are responsible for 

implementing resettlement, compensation and grievance redress for all infrastructure projects 

implemented in their respective woredas. These projects will benefit greatly from enhanced local-level 

capacity citizen engagement, fiduciary management, environmental and social management, and data 

production and dissemination. 

 

The proposed AF includes an allocation of US$100 million for the IPF component which aims at 

complementing the PforR by providing technical assistance and capacity building for service delivery 

system performance. The IPF component is made up of 3 sub-components which are described below. 

 

 Sub-component 1: Strengthening Systems and Sectors (US$30 million): This component 
provides support to the service delivery systems at the federal, regional and Woreda levels. 

Support to sectors is closely tied to the availability of quality data to monitor sectoral outputs 

and outcomes (including monitoring ESPES DLIs). The component will finance key activities 



such as (a) strengthening sectoral MIS for Education, Health, Agriculture and WASH, (b) 

providing finance and TA to the SARA health survey
1
, and (c) costs related to undertaking 

behavioral change campaigns for improving human development outcomes in the bottom 20 

percent of Woredas. The component will also finance activities that strengthen the procurement, 

financial management, governance, and social and environmental systems at decentralized 

levels.  

 Sub-component 2: Citizens Engagement (US$30 million): This component will finance three 
key areas of CE, namely (a) Financial Transparency and Accountability (US$5 million), (b) 

Grievance Redress Mechanisms (US$5 million), and (c) Social Accountability (US$20 

million). In FTA, the activities include support to budget literacy, media campaigns, support for 

audit and procurement information disclosure, related training assessing the effectiveness of 

FTA, strengthening FTA/GRM/SA linkages; capacity building support to the EIO and support 

to grievance management GRM offices. With regard to Social Accountability, to inform the 

implementation of the social accountability activities, the government is undertaking a study to 

determine the best institutional arrangement. It would involve that the government hires a 

national consultancy firm to manage the individual social accountability implementers. The 

choice will depend on technical expertise and capacity as well as independence to undertake 

social accountability activities. Overall, the technical design of the on-the-ground 

implementation of social accountability in the ESPES program will be informed by the ongoing 

design on the ESAP II successor program provided that those design details are agreed within 

the timeline of the preparation schedule of the ESPES AF. 

 Sub-component 3: Capacity building and M&E (US$40 million): The objective of the 
support is to strengthen the capacity of the Central Statistics Agency to produce and disseminate 

timely and reliable statistics to monitor progress under the second Growth and Transformation 

Plan. Some support will also be provided to VERA to improve vital statistics and especially the 

interface with CSA. The capacity building support for CSA and VERA will focus on 1) data 

production and dissemination, and 2) organizational and soft statistical infrastructure and 

capacity building; and 3) improving the quality of vital statistics. This component will also 

support M&E, management and operational costs including (a) incremental staffing costs, (b) 

operational costs including audits and program monitoring and evaluation, and (c) costs 

incurred by the DLI verification agencies.  

 

 
4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis 

(if known) 

 

 

The physical setting is not relevant for safeguard analysis as the IPF component does not involve any 

capital investment or civil works and will strengthen the system by (a) enhancing citizens’ engagement, 

environmental and social risk management capacity; (b) deepening fiduciary aspects of basic service 

delivery; and (c) ensuring quality data access and results. There will be no land acquisition or restriction 

of access in this IPF component. 

The ESPES AF will be implemented throughout the country. The objective of the system strengthening 

and capacity building IPF component is to improve the government’s federal, regional and woreda level 

administrative systems for implementing and monitoring the block grant program and for improving the 

efficiency and effectiveness of the country in delivering basic services to all woredas in environmentally 

and socially sustainable manner. For instance, the safeguards local capacity building element is relevant 

to all sectors because the woredas are responsible for implementing community consultation, land

acquisition and resettlement, including compensation enforcement and oversight of grievance redress 

mechanism, etc. for infrastructure development such as rural roads project regardless of funding 

sources. These projects will benefit greatly from enhanced local-level capacity in safeguards, especially 

in relation to social impacts and aspects, which are typically weaker than biophysical aspects, at woreda 

level.

 II. KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT 

 A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 

 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and 

describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 

 
There will not be any large scale and significant and/or irreversible impacts associated with this project. 

It will actually enhance local capacity in safeguards, which will be beneficial not only to basic sectors 

but also to all sectors implementing projects in woredas.  

 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in 

the project area: 

 
The long term impacts of the project activities are positive in terms of environmental and social 

management. The safeguards capacity building at local level will contribute towards improved 



environmental and social management in project design, implementation and monitoring in both the 

public and private sectors. 

 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 

impacts. 

 Not applicable 

 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 

assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 

 

A series of legal proclamations form the basis for the environmental and social assessment and 

management framework in Ethiopia: The Proclamation on the Establishment of Environmental 

Protection Organs (No. 295/2002); the Proclamation on Environmental Impact Assessment (No. 

299/2002); and the Proclamation on Environmental Pollution Control (No. 300/2002).  

 

As part of the Management Action Plan, in response to the PBS 3 Inspection Panel investigation, (a) the 

Government has developed Environmental and Social Management Operational Manual, and (b) a 

screening tool to manage the interface between Bank-financed projects and Commune Centers, was 

developed, and it is being rolled out. An Incremental ESSA was carried out as part of the preparation of 

the ESPES AF. It identified changes or improvement to the systems in place for environmental and 

social management at all levels, including taking stock of implementation capacity and performance at 

woreda level and the identification of any areas for improvement, based on the review of the original 

ESSA and any developments since then. This has informed the preparation of the safeguards IPF 

component with regard to local capacity building. 

 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 

safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 

 
The key stakeholders are the MoFEC, MoEFCC, basic sector ministries, BoFEDs and regional 

environmental agencies and basic sector bureaus. Consultation on the Incremental ESSA will be held, 

and it will be disclosed on the infoshop and in-country before appraisal.  

 B. Disclosure Requirements

B. Introduction and Context 
 
1. This program document outlines a proposed Program-for-Results (PforR) operation in the amount of US$750 
million to support the States of the Federal Government of Nigeria in their efforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-
19 pandemic on the livelihoods of poor and vulnerable households and microenterprises in the country. The proposed 
PforR is an emergency operation designed to support budgeted program of expenditures and interventions at the State 
level targeting existing and newly vulnerable and poor households, agricultural value chains, and micro and small 
enterprises affected by the economic crisis. The operation provides financial support to the States to fulfill program 
objectives in four key results areas: (i) strengthening institutional support for coordination and delivery; (ii) increasing 
cash transfers and livelihood support to poor and vulnerable households; (iii) increasing food security and safe 
functioning of food supply chains for poor households; and (iv) preventing collapse and facilitating recovery of 
household/micro enterprises. It is fully aligned with the forthcoming World Bank 2020–24 Country Partnership 
Framework for Nigeria, as well as Nigeria’s Economic Reform and Growth Plan for 2017–20 and the National Economic 
Council’s COVID-19 action plan.1   
 
Country Context 
 

2. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, poverty and vulnerability levels were already high in Nigeria. Measured 

using the national poverty line, the poverty rate in 2018/19 was 40 percent nationally, with poverty rates significantly 

higher in rural areas (52 percent) compared to urban areas (18 percent).2 Geographically, all three Northern regions have 

higher poverty rates compared to the Southern regions. The poverty rate in the North East (70.2 percent) is more than 

seven times higher than in the South West (9.7 percent). In addition to 40 percent of the population who fall below the 

poverty line, additional 25 percent of Nigerians are vulnerable to falling back into poverty in 2018/19.3 In the North East 

and North West, most individuals are either poor or vulnerable. Besides monetary poverty, Nigeria ranked sixth lowest 

globally in the World Bank’s Human Capital Index in 2018, with one in every three children under the age of five suffering 

from chronic malnutrition. In 2018, 63 percent of children in the poorest quintile were stunted compared to 18 percent 

in the richest quintile and only 29 percent of primary school age children from the poorest quintile were in school 

(adjusting for attendance) compared to 89 percent from the richest quintile, starkly highlighting the fact that the human 

capital indicators were far worse for the poorest segment of the population compared to the averages. The COVID-19 

crisis strikes at a time when Nigerian youth were already facing severe lack of job opportunities, with overall 

unemployment increasing from 8 percent in 2015 to 23 percent in 2018.4

poverty when shocks occur (or when the poverty line effectively rises due to inflation)

3. COVID-19 is expected to negatively affect economic growth in Nigeria, primarily due to the steep fall in global 
oil prices. Nigeria enjoyed relatively high and stable economic growth from 2000-2014, before the country went into a 
recession following the oil-price shock in late-2014. Growth averaged 6.1 percent between 2000-2014 before dropping 
below 3 percent in 2015 and turning negative in 2016. Nigerian economy has been recovering slowly since with the uptick 
in oil prices, but growth has stayed below 3 percent in subsequent years. As Nigeria’s economy and the government’s 
finances are highly dependent on revenues from sales of crude oil, current projections estimate the Nigerian economy to 
contract by at least 3 percent in 2020, due to the fall in oil prices caused by COVID-19.5  It is further expected that 
consolidated government revenues will fall by US$ 12 billion (3 percent of GDP) or more, severely constraining the 
government’s ability to respond to the crisis and at a time when fiscal resources are urgently needed to protect the poor 
and vulnerable from the negative impact of COVID-19. 
 
4. While the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases have grown slowly in Nigeria compared to the West, it is already 
having a severe impact on the lives and livelihoods of Nigerians. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, the Nigerian 
government had previously announced total lockdowns in urban centers in Lagos, Ogun, and Abuja. The prolonged month-
long lockdown severely impacted informal firms and workers in urban areas first before impacting rural areas, where many 
of Nigeria’s poor reside. An economic crisis such as the one caused by COVID-19 could push large segments of non-poor 
households back into poverty. With economic growth expected to decline by at least 3 percent in 2020, the poverty 
headcount rate is estimated to increase from 40.1 percent in 2019 to 42.5 percent in 2020 and will continue to rise absent 
any change in government policy. By 2022, the forecasts suggest that almost 100 million Nigerians will be below the 
poverty line, an additional 16.4 million poor people compared with today, which arises from both the rising poverty rate 
and natural population growth. While only 15.9 percent of the current poor are urban dwellers, 29.9 percent of the new 
poor in 2020 are predicted to be in urban areas. It is expected that consumption will fall across the distribution, leading 
to a rise in the poverty headcount rate and increase in the poverty gap index.  
 
5. The Government of Nigeria has taken important measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 and has put in place 
measures to cushion the poor and vulnerable against the negative impact of the crisis. A fiscal stimulus package in the 
form of a COVID-19 intervention fund of N500 billion (US$1.4 billion), has been approved by the President to support 
healthcare facilities, provide relief for taxpayers, and incentivize employers to retain and recruit staff during the downturn. 
Regulated fuel prices have been reduced, and an automatic fuel price formula introduced to ensure fuel subsidies are 
eliminated. The President also ordered an increase of the social register by 1 million households to 3.6 million to help 
cushion the effect of the lockdown. The Central Bank has instituted a N50 billion targeted credit facility for households 
and Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) that have been affected by COVID-19. The president also approved the 
establishment of a N500 billion COVID-19 crisis intervention fund while the restructuring of the Treasury Single Account 
(‘TSA’) is in progress to better mobilize cash donations from people and corporate bodies across the country. 
 

Sectoral (or multi-sectoral) and Institutional Context of the Program 
 

 
6. The proposed PforR is part of a broader emergency package offered by the World Bank Group, which is 

anchored by the key measures taken by the government, and complemented by support from other development 

partners, to put in place measures to respond to the pandemic. The Government of Nigeria is establishing a multi-

faceted economic, fiscal and health response to COVID-19 at the federal and state level and has requested a significant 

package of support from the World Bank. Based on request from the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and Planning, 

the World Bank is preparing a multi-pronged package of support of between USD 2.5 billion and USD 3 billion over the

next six months, which includes the Nigeria CARES PforR. The broader support package includes programs designed to: 

(i) Contain the COVID-19 outbreak and prepare for a more severe outbreak (REDISSE); (ii) Immediate fiscal relief for the 

federal government (CoFFER) and funding to protect core government functions to the State level (SFTAS); and (iii) 

Support for protecting livelihoods, local economic activity, and enabling recovery (CARES and NAASP).  

 
 
7. Existing social safety nets programs can be leveraged to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 on vulnerable groups 
but the targeting mechanisms needs to be expanded and adapted to capture the people who will be vulnerable due to 
the COVID-19.  A total of more than 5.4 million Nigerians (adults and children) have benefited from existing social safety 
net interventions (Cash Transfer, Public Workfare, Special Grants to Vulnerable and Skills for Job). However, identification 
of the poor in Nigeria remains challenging due to the inadequacy of data. Multiple definitions of poverty and vulnerability 
and lack of clarity on welfare measures adds to existing challenges. In recent times, the State Social Registry and the 
National Social Registry of poor and vulnerable households have been established under the World Bank financed Youth 
Employment and Social Support Operation6 and National Social Safety Nets Project (NASSP)7 using a combined 
geographical and community-based identification and targeting system verified through proxy means testing to rank 
households. The state level registry that started in 2016 has limited coverage in many of the urban locations. There is a 
renewed effort to rapidly expand the coverage of the registries and use other objective criteria of vulnerability to capture 
the new poor especially in urban areas.  The newly created Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and 
Social Development is planning to provide the appropriate platform for interagency collaboration. The new National Living 
Standard Survey 2018/19, provides an opportunity to validate and strengthen the social registries at State and National 
level and to ensure harmonization with other existing beneficiary registries.  
 
8. The Community and Social Development Project supports the empowerment of communities and vulnerable 
groups within communities to develop, implement, and monitor social infrastructure service micro-projects (such as in 
basic services – health, education, water, roads, skills centers, among others) and natural resource management 
interventions. It also strengthens the capacity of local government authorities, LGAs and sectoral public agencies to 
support communities and build a partnership between them. The CSDP is currently managed at the State level by State 
Agencies established by Law of the States. 30 States of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory are participating 
in the project. Kaduna State has just established its own Community and Social Development Agencies CSDA. Delta and 
Rivers has CDD/PIUs imbedded in relevant Ministries that operates like CSDAs and supported by SEEFOR -a World Bank 
assisted project in the Niger Delta.  Only Lagos, Kano and Jigawa are not participating in CSDP but do have community 
engagement agencies and departments. There is a Federal Project Support unit responsible for coordination, technical 
support, monitoring and evaluation and finance resources mobilization and management. A total of 4,600 Community 
Development plans and over 600 Group Development Plans are now approved and funded as of December 2019.  The 
North East States continued to improve on the number of CDPs and GDPs. Over 2 million people are benefiting from the 
CSDP interventions in the North East while across all the participating state, well over 7 million individuals are benefiting 
from CSDP as of December 2019.  
 

 
6 YESSO a State level Social Safety Net Operation started the State Social Registry in 2015 from a USD 400m IDA credit. It also supports 3 major 
interventions at the State level- Pubic workfare, Special Grants to the Internally Displaced persons in North East and the Aged and physically 
challenged, and Skills for Job. It is closing in June 2020. 
7 NASSP, through its exiting budget available from the IDA of USD 500 million and USD 321 million from the government through Abacha Restituted 
Fund, will be scaled up horizontally and vertically to support the existing 1 million poor and vulnerable households (over 5 million people) currently 
benefiting from CCT and will enroll additional 1 million poor and vulnerable households (5 million people) from the National Social Registry to 
receive Cash Transfer support for at least 1 year to cushion the impact of COVID-19 on poor and vulnerable households.

9. The National Fadama Development Project is a state-level intervention coordinated by the Federal 
Government. Beginning in 1990 with a pilot agricultural project (Fadama I) designed to bring basic irrigation and 
productive support to farmers in selected Nigerian states, the Fadama series have evolved through two subsequent 
innovative and adaptive pro-jects (Fadama II and III) that are now well established nationally. Fadama II, launched in 2003, 
introduced a groundbreaking Community-Driven Development (CDD) model to Nigeria’s rural areas and helped 
institutionalized local stakeholder engagement in community decision making. Since 2009 when Fadama III series 
commenced, it has contributed to the Government of Nigeria’s development objectives and policy in terms of gross 
domestic product, food security, rural development, and employment generation. Cassava farmers under Fadama III, and 
it’s two additional Financing Facilities realized more than N20.6 billion as revenue and a gross margin of N13 billion in 
2019. Similarly, rice, sorghum and tomato farmers realized gross margin of N104.4 billion, N60.9 billion and N19.2 billion 
respectively during the project’s life span. The project performance evaluation report showed that 100 percent of the 
beneficiaries have increased their real income by at least 40%. Yield rose from a baseline of 5.27t/ha to 25.34t/ha for 
cassava (380.83%), 2.83t/ha to 4.93t/ha for rice (74.2%), 1.54t/ha to 2.4t/ha for sorghum (55.84%), and 1.6t/ha to 
30.44t/ha for tomato (1,802.5%).  
 
10. The Fadama structure has been successfully deployed to provide solutions to national challenges, including 
delivering inputs and services to farmers, investing in various types of productive agricultural infrastructure and assets, 
improving food supply chains in underserved areas, and supporting programs to increase employment of graduate 
youths. Specifically, the project had, in 2017 competitively empowered 6,916 unemployed youth and women graduates 
who indicated interest in becoming agricultural entrepreneurs. Fadama project has proved to be a reliable platform for 
implementing rural based intervention and activities that could target the poor and the vulnerable with sufficient national 
spread and capacity. There is a National Fadama Coordinating Unit responsible for coordination, technical support, 
monitoring and evaluation to the State Level operation.  A total of 18,650 Business Plans have been prepared and over 
220,551 farmers across 19,469 production groups in 3,051 Production Clusters have received various trainings.  In the 
Conflict affected North East region, Fadama has helped to restore the livelihoods (crops, livestock, fisheries, and non-
agricultural enterprises) of 32,480 farming households with 950,400 man-days of work provided to the beneficiaries. Over 
1,218,824 people have benefited from the Fadama interventions across the country.  
 
11. In many of the States there are SME support Agencies of the State Government and also Ministries of Commerce 
and Industry as well as Ministries of Cooperatives with programs and initiatives on promotion and facilitation of 
household enterprises (micro and small). Some of the Ministry, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) provide small loans 
and grants to registered businesses. Registration and regulations of local firms and enterprises are also managed by the 
MDAs. At the Federal level there is the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Program (GEEP) initiative administered 
by the Bank of Industry exist in all 36 States of the Federation and FCT. The GEEP provides loans of between ₦10,000 ($28) 
and ₦300,000 ($835) to traders, artisans, enterprising youth, and farmers. The program commenced in 2016 and has 
empowered 2.2 million such micro-enterprises with interest-free loans to grow their businesses up to date, making it the 
largest public microcredit program. The majority of these micro-enterprises are in over 2,100 clusters and markets across 
all 36 states of Nigeria, and the capital. As of today, about 5 million GEEP candidates are connected to the Consolidated 
Beneficiary Register for the National Social Investment Program. The number is growing. Candidates can also be served 
on other programs i.e. school feeding, cash transfers, etc. The GEEP program has over 4,300 local agents nationwide to 
verify beneficiaries and perform credit check before loans are disbursed to the beneficiaries’ mobile wallet. Funds can be 
cashed out with minimal intermediation to reduce transaction costs and fraud. The program, in addition to provide quick 
financial intermediation to the needed enterprises, can also serve in more data capture.  Partnership between state MDAs 
supporting household enterprises (micro and small) and GEEP can be a veritable mechanism especially at this time when 
local economy is at the mercy of the health crisis and the economic downturn.

Relationship to CAS/CPF 
 
12. The proposed PforR supports the World Bank Group’s Nigeria CPF for 2020-24 and is aligned with the framework 
of support proposed by the World Bank Africa region and the WBG Social Response Framework. The CPF reflects 
Nigeria’s aspiration for faster, more inclusive, and sustained economic growth in the next decade to help the government 
in its ambition to lift 100 million people out of poverty. This PforR directly supports the CPF’s Pillars on “Investing in human 
capital and social inclusion”, “Fostering Jobs and Economic Transformation”, and “Reducing fragility and building 
resilience”. More specifically, the PFORR: (i) enables the States to continue to build and expand their social protection 
systems to strengthen safety nets and basic services; (ii) prevents disruptions and job losses in agricultural supply chains 
by supporting linkages between farmers and markets; and (iii) helps micro and small enterprises wither the impact of the 
economic crisis by providing support in the form of credits and grants. The PFORR also addresses priorities outlined in the 
2019 Systematic Country Diagnostic for Nigeria by averting further erosion of human capital, supporting private firms and 
microenterprises to stay afloat, and continuing the provision of basic services to the most vulnerable groups. The PFORR 
is also fully aligned with the Africa region’s framework of protecting lives, livelihoods, and the future to address the 
pandemic and the multifaceted action plan proposed in the WBG Social Response Framework of saving lives, protecting 
the poor and vulnerable, securing jobs and the economy, and accelerating a resilient recovery.

13. The PforR instrument allows the States to access funds for budgeted programs of expenditures and comes at a 
time when the decline in revenues threatens the ability of the government to respond to the crisis. Unprecedented 
decline in oil prices (70 percent since the start of the crisis) has constrained the government’s ability to respond to the 
crisis. 80 percent of Nigeria’s exports, 30 percent of banking-sector credit, and 50 percent of general government revenues 
rely on sales of crude oil. Much of the nonoil industrial and services sectors also rely on foreign-exchange inflows 
generated by the oil industry. With the Nigerian economy expected to contract 5 percentage points below the pre-COVID 
19 economic growth forecast, States will require substantial funds to quickly and effectively respond to the crisis. Some 
of the ₦500 billion funds allocated as the federal government’s fiscal stimulus package will be implemented at the State 
level and would need to be reflected in the State government’s budget. As the PforR is designed for a 2-year emergency 
response, using and strengthening existing programs and platforms also has the added benefit of building capacity of 
those platforms to ensure sustainability beyond the duration of the program. The PforR aims to build strong coordination 
mechanisms between the Federal and State level of the government. Strong level of Federal oversight and support could 
help States lagging in capacity to implement programs to protect livelihoods and food security of poor and vulnerable 
households and facilitate recovery of local economic activities.  The PforR instrument also allows states to quickly access 
funds using existing government programs and systems, reducing the transaction processes. Finally, the program is 
designed to disburse against tangible results and provides flexibility to the States to achieve the results that are best suited 
to their needs.

14. To achieve the development objective, the proposed Program would include the following four result areas: 
  

a. Increased social transfers, basic services, and livelihood support to poor and vulnerable households; 
b. Increasing food security and safe functioning of food supply chains for poor households; 
c. Facilitating recovery and enhancing capabilities of micro and small enterprises (MSEs); 
d. Strengthened institutional support for coordination and delivery;

15. Results Area 1 aims to address the immediate needs of poor and vulnerable households by providing income 

and consumption support and access to basic services.  Through this results area, the program will support existing 
platforms that provide social transfers to vulnerable groups including the aged, disabled, and chronically ill and support 
income generating opportunities of economically active poor and vulnerable households through cash transfers and labor-
intensive public works. Existing programs that provide services to poor and vulnerable communities through funding of 
basic social and economic infrastructure microprojects will also be eligible for funding support. Selected programs must 
provide clear and measurable criteria to evaluate results that contribute to improved consumption and welfare of poor 
and vulnerable households. 

 
16. Results Area 2 will provide support to increase food security of poor and vulnerable households. Through this

results area, the P4R will support existing platforms that support poor and vulnerable households to increase production 
of food, maintain economic activities along food value chains, and enable safe access to food markets as buyers or sellers. 
The immediate needs to support agricultural livelihoods could include distribution of inputs, provision of services 
(extension, mechanization, animal services), farm agricultural assets, replacement of small ruminants, etc. Similarly, the 
future capacity to produce food could be supported through small-scale irrigation infrastructure, on-farm soil conservation 
measures, etc. Investments to increase food accessibility in future could be supported through sanitary infrastructure in 
wet markets, feeder roads to enable access to markets, increased capacity for small-scale processing, among others. The 
selected program areas must provide clear and measurable results that contribute to increasing food availability, 
accessibility and utilization and can be generated within the 18-24 months’ timeframe. 

 
17. Results Area 3 will support Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) intervention programs and initiatives at Sub-

National level in Nigeria. Leveraging existing State-level MSE platforms, the program will support initiatives that eases 
financial constraints on MSEs, provide financing to support operational expenses of existing MSEs to cover a portion of its 
operational cost including salaries of permanent staff and rental expenses, and invest in MSEs’ infrastructure and IT 
(digital) development. Existing platforms that support both formal and informal firms will be eligible. However, targeting 
mechanisms will be supported to identify vulnerable and viable firms with clear timeline to phase out in order to maximize 
the fungibility of the financing resources. 
 
E. Initial Environmental and Social Screening 
 

18. Based on current available information in terms of the scope of the Program, no high Environmental and Social 
risks are anticipated due to proposed program activities. In terms of potential environmental impacts, there could be 
risk of waste management, soil and ground water contamination, pest management, construction related risk and impacts 
including capacity to manage the grant component for MSMEs. There could be moderate risks and impacts posed due to 
small scale land acquisition causing resettlement during rehabilitation / construction of secondary / tertiary irrigation 
canals; rehabilitation of tertiary roads; rehabilitation / construction of agricultural warehouse; upgrading of sanitary 
infrastructures in wet markets. These infrastructure activities could also pose labor risks, GBV and community health risks 
when contractors/labor force are brought into remote areas for certain project activities including potential cumulative 
impacts. These will be further reviewed and assessed during the Environmental and Social Systems Assessment (ESSA) 
that would be prepared prior to appraisal. This current rating would be adjusted accordingly as additional information 
becomes available and based on the outcomes of the ESSA assessment.
