B. Introduction and Context 

 
Country Context 

 

1. Rwanda is increasingly recognized as a global exemplar in the pursuit of the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDG) and in meeting the global challenges of climate change. Rwanda’s economy has 
been amongst the fastest growing among the sub-Saharan African (SSA) region. Despite remaining one of 
the poorest on the continent with per capita incomes of US$1,720 (2015, in purchasing power parity 
terms) the economy is nevertheless undergoing rapid structural transformation. Overall Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) growth has averaged 7.6 percent per annum (p.a.) over 2000 – 15, with urbanization rates 
of 7 percent p.a. over the same period. 
 

2. After slowing to 5.1 percent in 2017, real GDP growth is expected to pick up in 2018-19, 
averaging 5.9 percent, and inflation has increased above the National Bank of Rwanda’s (BNR) target 
ceiling of 5 percent.1 BNR has raised interest rates to prevent capital outflow and this will likely force a 
tightening of monetary policy in 2017 – 18. BNR has reduced the repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.5 percent 
to encourage commercial banks to lower lending rates to drive growth in private-sector credit and 
stimulate economic growth.2 Rwanda’s large current account deficit (16 percent of GDP in 2016) has been 
exerting downward pressure on the Rwandan franc (FRw). Higher oil and commodity prices (as well as 
large purchases including new planes for the national carrier) have seen the import bill increase although 
this is expected to be mitigated by recovering commodity prices in tea, coffee and minerals – Rwanda’s 
three main exports. On the fiscal side, the fiscal deficit is expected to narrow from an estimated 4.7 
percent of GDP in 2016/17 to 4.4 percent of GDP in 2018/19, financed by external project-based debt and 
some budgetary loans from development partners and multilateral institutions.3 Notwithstanding these 
emerging domestic and international trends, the overall policy stance of the Government of Rwanda (GoR) 
is likely to remain in line with the existing Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) 
(approved in 2013) and its successor to be finalized and approved in 2018. 

 

3. Rwanda’s Vision 2050 sets an ambitious agenda for further improvements in the standard of 
living, targeting middle-income country (MIC) status by 2020. Parallel targets to reduce food insecurity 
and malnutrition and to further reduce poverty from 45 percent today (according to the national poverty 
line; the headcount rate is 63 percent according to the US$1.25 per day measure) are evidence of a deep 
political commitment to the twin goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity. Except for a period 
between 2000/01 and 2005/06 when the Gini coefficient rose slightly, rapid growth has not been 
associated with an increase in equality. At the same time, the country has embarked on several flagship 
projects to promote a highly skilled service economy, notably around conferences and hospitality and 
information and communication technology (ICT). 

 

4. However, Government spending programs are currently under pressure. The increase in total 
public spending in 2013-2015 has been exclusively for capital expenditures and net lending as recurrent 
expenditures have held steady. The adjustment program of recent years to address growing external 
imbalances restrained the overall fiscal envelope. Health expenditures, for example, have declined both

as a percent of GDP and in terms of their share in the budget in recent years. Going forward, resource 
availability will be further constrained because of a continuing decline in external grant financing. 
Although the headline fiscal deficit will be more expansionary in FY18/19, the decline in grant financing 
will continue to depress the overall fiscal envelope. Going forward, Rwanda’s fiscal spending will remain 
constrained due to the elevated debt and subdued tax revenues.  

 

5. The Government is also concerned by the emerging demographic trends and the rapidly 
expanding ambitions and expectations of new entrants to the labor market. Demographic projections 
suggest that by 2032 rural areas will be home to an additional 2.5 – 3.5 million Rwandans; land is already 
so scarce (50 percent of rural farm households farm less than 0.35ha) that few can be meaningfully 
accommodated in farming. With a working age population projected to increase from 5.2 million (in 2014) 
to 6.6 million – of which 4 million will be youth (14 – 35 years old), realizing labor productivity potential 
and meeting individual aspirations will require off-farm employment opportunities. This need not imply 
urban-based employment. Agriculture and the food system broadly (i.e. non-agriculture sector jobs 
nevertheless part of the food system such as retail, agro-processing, food logistics etc.) can provide 
substantial rural-based non-farm employment (RNFE). Current economic modeling indicates around two-
fifths of the 200,000 new labor market entrants annually could be gainfully employed in this sector.  
 

6. Continued urbanization will present many challenges as well as opportunities including for the 
agricultural sector. By 2050 Rwanda’s population is projected to reach 22 million of which 70 percent 
would reside in urban areas. Assuming similar patterns are observed elsewhere in the region, food 
preferences will change with increasing incomes, with increasing demand for more standardized and 
packaged or processed food and food safety will become increasingly important. This will threaten existing 
supply chains from domestic producers, with likely upward pressure on the food import bill and foreign 
currency reserves. At the same time, tapping into this emerging market can be an important opportunity 
for expanding domestic value chains, diversifying out of food staples and further value addition across the 
agriculture and food system. Meeting these challenges for the domestic market can also serve as a 
launching pad for successfully penetrating regional and international markets. 

 
Sectoral and Institutional Context 

7. Notwithstanding, Rwanda’s impressive progress and likely future growth, the country remains 
largely agrarian with agriculture the mainstay of jobs, income and livelihoods for much of the 
population. The sector continues to account for around one-third of GDP. Because of its forward and 
backward linkages, it remains a key driver of overall economic performance and poverty reduction 
(accounting directly for over one-third of the overall reduction in poverty from 59 percent in 2001 to 45 
percent in 2011). 
 

8. Historically, aggregate agricultural performance has been driven by productivity improvements 
and land expansion. Aggregate production of key food staples such as maize, beans, Irish potato, sweet 
potato etc. has increased steadily since the end of the Genocide. According to recent analysis by the 
International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), agriculture’s aggregate growth rate of 5 percent p.a. 
in recent years has been made up of land expansion (2 percentage points) and productivity growth (1.7 
percentage points) with the remainder from increased labor productivity. Rwanda is already among the 
most densely populated countries in SSA and land expansion has been achieved through developing inland 
swamps and valleys with rapidly declining potential for further gains.

9. Despite productivity gains, yields remain below their potential. Crop yields have greatly 
increased since 2000 but yield growth started to plateau as of 2011. (For instance, cereal and cassava 
yields have trebled, sweet potato yields have doubled yet they have made marginal progress in the last 
five years and remain at around 40 – 50 percent of their potential.) Similarly, livestock productivity has 
remained consistently low over time due to lack of good quality animal feed and poor husbandry 
management practices. Diversification into higher value crops has been limited to date, partly because of 
limited farmer knowledge and traditional risk aversion, and also because the public-sector support 
services has been excessively focused on a narrow range of food staples under the Government’s flagship 
Crop Intensification Program (CIP).  

 

10. Farm size is a major challenge.  The average is only 0.6 ha, with perhaps 0.12 ha per worker.  
Production on numerous small plots of land can impose technical inefficiencies related to water control 
and distribution, crop choice and interactions, and planting materials used, while limiting the potential 
for mechanized plowing. The government has made significant progress on land consolidation.  Land 
under consolidated use rose from 28,788 ha in 2007 to 502,916 ha in 2012, primarily through 
consolidation of production rather than of ownership (World Bank, 2014).  The consolidation process has 
not involved mandatory consolidation of ownership, and planting, cultivation and harvesting are still 
carried out by the individual land owners, albeit on a communal schedule (Pritchard, 2013).  

 

11. The agriculture value chains face key constraints at every stage. Research and extension is 
dominated by public institutions which are understaffed. There are insufficient extension services to 
support both quantity and quality, and there are weak linkages between research and extension. Input 
supply systems are driven by the public sector, there is low awareness of the advantages of quality inputs, 
domestic seed production is low and there is limited access to finance. Production potential is restricted 
by land size, subsistence and rain-fed farming, mono-cropping, limited access to irrigation and 
mechanization. Post production is impacted by poor storage techniques and insufficient storage and 
drying infrastructure and safety and quality of produce affected by poor storage and drying. Processing is 
characterized by low capacity utilization. - Less than 10 percent of total production is processed. The 
supply of raw material is irregular and limited. The agricultural workforce has a low level of technical skills. 
Finally, markets are informal and unorganized, Rwanda country branding is weak, and the price-sensitive 
domestic market poses a challenge for start ups to enter the market. 
 

12. The government has focused on extending the rural roads network with a main objective of 
connecting to regional markets and opportunities exists for scaling up regional connectivity. A 
significant proportion of Rwanda’s rural population, whose livelihoods depend on agriculture, lacks access 
to rural transport facilities, including feeder roads. In 2015, only 13,350 km of roads were in good or 
passable condition, but Rwanda targets to have 30,000 km of passable roads by 2028. Poor connectivity 
hampers agricultural development and prevents farmers from increasing access to markets, enhancing 
their competitiveness and improving their incomes and livelihoods. A national feeder roads strategy has 
been developed which establishes the Feeder Roads implementation framework with clear-cutting 
institutional responsibilities for different stakeholders in the Feeder roads sub-sector, promoting labour-
based technology in feeder roads development and outlining mechanisms for funding feeder roads 
development and maintenance.

13.  Rwanda’s proximity to many of the continent’s key food markets and increased global/regional 
consumption for key export crops including bio-fortified staples, presents significant opportunities 
(especially through EAC and COMESA) for enlarged export markets, transport corridors and cross-border 
trade cooperation. Global and regional markets for higher-value agricultural items are also becoming 
more demanding in terms of quality, food safety, and branding, but also more remunerative. Rwanda is 
well-placed to benefit from expanding regional food markets, providing the facilitating investments in 
infrastructure and institutions are in place and the private sector responds. 

 

14. Moreover, existing farming practices are ill-suited to the challenges of climate change, with the 
agriculture sector accounting for 45.6 percent of national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and poorly 
equipped to adapt to changing weather patterns. Climate change projections are highly uncertain, and 
so precise changes to agro-climatic conditions in what is an agro-ecologically diverse country are hard to 
predict. What is certain, however, is that the system is not yet equipped to model, forecast and adapt as 
changes occur and greater evidence becomes available to hone down climate change forecasts. According 
to a recent assessment by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), few climate smart 
agricultural practices are currently deployed. Current on-farm practices are leading to rapid declines in 
soil fertility and land degradation. 
 

15. In addition, Rwanda remains challenged by malnutrition especially among rural households 
with extremely small land holdings, and pervasive food insecurity. The national rate of stunting remains 
high at 38 percent while the latest Comprehensive Food Security and Nutrition Survey (2016) reports that 
around one-fifth of households remain food insecure. The pattern of stunting and food insecurity is 
complex and not only related to food availability – food insecurity is greatest in the western and northern 
areas and stunting is observed even in relatively non-poor areas due to inadequate child care and poor 
sanitation practices, in particular. A narrow focus on a few traditional food staples under the CIP resulted 
in limited dietary diversity, yet there are emerging opportunities with bio-fortification. The Government’s 
existing kitchen garden program is reportedly contributing to broader nutritional intake, although further 
improvements are required. 

 

16. In Rwanda the labor force is growing at a rapid pace annually with census projections showing 
that the working-age population will grow by about 240,000 per year between 2016 and 2025. This 
growth is substantially larger than the increase in jobs during the last 15 years. Acknowledging the 
demographic trends, the ongoing Second Five-Year Economic Development and Poverty Reduction 
Strategy (EDPRS-2) of the Government of Rwanda (GoR) has an ambitious target of creating 200,000 off-
farm jobs annually. For off-farm jobs, both the formal and informal sector will be important. The 
informal non-farm sector absorbed 70 percent of the new workers between 2006 and 2011 and will 
continue to absorb workers who seek a better living outside agriculture. Employment in the formal 
sector, while growing quickly, will remain low for the foreseeable future given it is starting from a low 
base. Even so, the sector remains important since most of the perceived ‘good’ jobs are created by the 
formal private sector. Increases in agriculture productivity and job creation in industries related to 
agriculture (agro-processing, agribusiness) will also support employment outcomes for the most 
vulnerable, unskilled workers. 

 

17. Women perform the bulk of the labor in the agriculture sector, putting in approximately 51 hours 
per week on farm and domestic duties compared to men who work 40 hours. Most women farmers lack

the means to purchase high-quality seeds and proper storage facilities to protect their crops. Many also 
never received education on effective farming methods to increase yields and to ensure that the soil on 
their land remains healthy. This creates a cycle of subsistence farming leaving very little or no profit from 
outputs for farmers to use as a source of income or capital.  

 

18. Despite the observed growth, the non-farm enterprise sector maintains a limited presence. 
Rwanda’s non-farm enterprise sector has been growing from a small base. The number of business 
establishments has increased to 149,404 in 2014 – an increase of 18 percent since 2011 – providing 
employment to 361,901 workers in 2014. However, employment in business establishments represents 
only a small portion of overall employment in Rwanda, with agriculture still being the dominant activity. 
The enterprise sector provided employment to 6.2 percent of working-age Rwandans in 2014 (361,901 
jobs of a labor force of 5,785,000). In addition, there is a limited presence of medium- and large-sized 
private firms and vibrancy in the sector has yet to fully emerge.   

 

19. Considering these trends and projections, Rwanda is committed to identifying and addressing 
the policies, regulations, and investment areas that will stimulate inclusive productivity growth for 
broadening nutritious food production and increasing private sector investment. Furthermore, there is 
commitment across the GoR to pursue new opportunities for farm income diversification to secure further 
reductions in rural poverty, strengthen resilience against the impacts of climate change and to transform 
the dominant subsistence farming sector into a competitive and market-led agriculture sector. Their 
objectives for the food and agriculture system mirror the scale of their broader national goals in terms of 
ambition and conviction to achieve them. 

 

20. To codify these ambitions and articulate a road map to achieve them, the Ministry of Agriculture 
and Animal Resources (MINAGRI) revised and updated their National Agricultural Policy (NAP) in 2017. 
The National Agricultural Policy 2017-2030 responds to the changes facing agriculture and the food system 
nationally, regionally and globally. Under this policy, the role of government in agriculture is envisaged to 
fundamentally shift from making direct interventions in the sector – especially with a focus on production 
only – to a market enabler, thereby promoting enhanced farmer cooperation and private-sector-led 
development of the agri-food economy. The policy seeks to build upon Rwanda’s growing reputation as 
supplier of high-quality, sustainably produced agri-food products, especially for the increasingly 
demanding consumers in Africa’s growing urban centers. It places added emphasis on principles of 
resilience to changes in climate and markets and seeks to seize opportunities offered by advances in 
digitalization and information and communication technology (ICT), and to leverage these also for 
vocational-skill development and for more effective sector administration. The policy also aims to 
promote inclusion through mainstreaming preferential treatment for better participation of women and 
youth in agriculture programs and development. 
 

21. MINAGRI has prepared its fourth Strategic Plan for Agriculture Transformation (PSTA 4) which 
is an articulation of how the Government proposes to implement the updated NAP. PSTA 4 is 
structured around four Priority Areas which are well aligned to the NAP. Priority Area 1: Innovation and 
Extension focuses on improving agronomic knowledge and technology in terms of basic research and 
innovation, development of efficient proximity extension services, as well as promoting knowledge and 
skills of value chain actors; Priority Area 2: Productivity and Resilience focuses on promoting sustainable 
and resilient production systems for crops and animal resources; Priority Area 3: Inclusive markets and

value addition seeks to improve markets and linkages between production and processing; and Priority 
Area 4: Enabling Environment and Responsive Institutions that provides the regulatory framework and 
defines and coordinates public sector involvement. In addition, although women and youth are 
mainstreamed across all priority areas, Priority Area 4 features specific measures and incentives to 
increase gender equity and to introduce skilled youth to commercial farming and jobs along the 
agricultural value chains. PSTA 4 builds on the experience of implementing the previous strategic plan 
(PSTA 3) and provides a basis for ‘future-proofing agriculture to prepare for risks such as those inherent 
in climate change, considering the constraints and opportunities of Rwanda’s demographic, 
geographical and strategic conditions. 
 

22. In addition to MINAGRI, key actors in the sector include the National Agricultural Export 
Development Board (NAEB) and the Rwanda Agriculture Board (RAB). NAEB is responsible for the 
implementation of policies and strategies for promoting and developing agricultural and livestock 
products for export. RAB is an autonomous body largely responsible for research and extension, 
strengthening the linkage with policy, and establish efficiency in service delivery through institutional 
integration in the agricultural sector.  

 

23. PSTA 4 will also be aligned to National Policies and Strategies including Vision 2050, the Third 
Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS III), and relevant sub-sector strategies. 
The EDPRS III was designed to address the Rwanda’s commitment to the SDGs, Intended Nationally 
Determined Contributions (INDC’s) on agriculture, and the Paris Climate Agreement.  The African Union 
has confirmed that PSTA 4 is aligned with goals of Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development 
Program (CAADP) and key regional programs. 

 

24. The proposed Program for Results (PforR) operation will be nested within PSTA 4. PSTA 4 is in 
the final stages of approval – led by a core team within MINAGRI and benefiting from a broad group of 
development partners, including the World Bank and CAADP institutions. PSTA 4 has been endorsed by 
the GoR and will be formally approved at the CAADP Business Meeting on May 15, 2018. Reflecting 
emerging best-practice with PforR operations, the specifics of the PforR Program are drawn from the 
broader PSTA 4 and nested within the Government’s strategy. 

 
PforR Program Scope 

 

25. The responsibility of agriculture public sector institutions, and of MINAGRI in particular, to lead 
the national transformation process outlined in PSTA 4 is clear. The achievement of this transformative 
agenda will require intense policy work with a particular focus on how to promote and support 
agribusiness at all stages of key value chains while balancing commercialization with the consideration of 
poverty reduction and environmental sustainability in a complex, dynamic and risk prone national and 
regional context. The nature of this leadership will be less through the direct delivery of service but will 
be through “thought leadership”, problem solving, policy definition, capacity building, joint enterprise or 
strategic partnership, resource mobilization, regulation, coordination, information management and 
communication. 

 

26. There have been several organizational reviews of agriculture sector institutions as well as review 
and reform exercises intended to inform the transformation of the public sector as a whole.  In addition,

various reports and evaluations, including the 2016 Agriculture Public Expenditure Review and the 2017 
Mid Term Review of the PSTA 3 Strategy have raised significant issues of an institutional nature.  
Furthermore, recent sub sectoral reports or strategies including the Agriculture Finance Diagnostic and 
the National Agribusiness Investment Promotion Strategy (NAIPS) make clear the need for institutional 
reform.  

 

27. The PforR Program has incorporated the recommendations from these reviews and studies into 
its design.  In addition, the design draws on the lessons learned from previous attempts to build capacity 
within MINAGRI, including the first PforR Program. Specifically, the attempts to undertake reforms 
without significant attention to a well design reform process, sustainably addressing Human Resource 
constraints, ensuring communication/coordination are prioritized and ensuring new ways of working are 
well designed and appropriately incentivized.  As a result, the PforR Program makes a sequenced, focused 
and results based approach to the institutional change process central to its design.  

 

28. The scale and complexity of PSTA 4’s institutional reform agenda is significant. However, it will 
take time for MINAGRI to fully establish and strategically apply its “thought leadership” capacity.  Many 
of the expected outcomes will only be fully delivered, at the required scale, during the latter years of PSTA 
4 implementation. In that context, the PforR Program, which supports the first three years of PSTA 4, is 
focused on a series of mutually reinforcing interventions -  some of which are activities, that will deliver 
intermediate outcomes but, more importantly, incentivize organizational reform, create new policy 
instruments, build increased capacity, and establish new systems that will build a sound institutional 
platform to enable MINAGRI to deliver PSTA 4. 
 

29. The proposed PforR operation will support the first three years (2018 – 2021) of the six-year 
strategy of the PSTA 4 (2018-2024). This period of PSTA 4 is focused on establishing a platform for change 
and new ways of working, including the way MINAGRI is structured and reflecting the way it is more 
private sector facing.  

 

30. There is a possibility of supporting the final three years through additional financing, subject and 
without prejudice to normal Bank approval procedures. The activities to be supported under the PforR 
Program correspond to the MINAGRI PSTA 4 agenda. In this context, the focus of the proposed PforR 
operation will be on strengthening the capacity of MINAGRI to increase private sector investment and to 
enable the commercialization of key agriculture value chains in Rwanda’s agriculture sector. Based on 
value chain diagnostics (further elaborated in the technical assessment ANNEX 4) and taking into 
consideration the Bank’s comparative advantage regarding the PSTA 4 Priority areas, the PforR Program 
is constructed around an organizing framework of the following four results areas: 
 

31. Results Area 1: Policy and Organizational Reform – aligned with PSTA 4 Priority Area 4: The PforR 
Program will seek to improve the structure and capability of MINAGRI in order to strengthen sector 
analysis, associated policy reforms and design/introduce relevant financing mechanisms/business models 
for attracting private sector investment. MINAGRI will demonstrate this new capacity by producing a 
Private Sector Leveraging Strategy to guide processes that will leverage private sector financing, while 
ensuring environmental and social standards are maintained. In addition, the foundations for digital data 
systems will be launched to improve management information and enable greater innovation. 
Furthermore, a new mechanism will be established to enable greater interagency coordination (including

key stakeholders such as Ministry of Trade, Financial sector actors, etc.) and communication.   
 

32. Results Area 2: Enabling Agric Commercialization - aligned with PSTA 4 Priority Area 4:  The 
second PforR Results Area focuses on specific interventions to improve the quality of public investments 
in essential value chain services to leverage commercial agriculture. This includes key areas such as 
infrastructure and research, by introducing new business models that will link public investments to 
commercial markets and leverage increased levels private sector investments. PSTA 4 advocates for 
maximizing the effectiveness and efficiency of public investment by leveraging increased private sector 
investment in service provision and delivery/management of agricultural infrastructure. 
 

33. Results Area 3: Delivery of Improved Agric Value Chain Services - aligned with PSTA 4 Priority 
Areas 3 & 4.  The PforR Program will support fostering competitive agricultural value chains, which 
requires the public sector to provide critical services to support production, processing, logistics, 
marketing and the like. This approach is consistent with MFD principles.  The public function supported 
by the PforR Program is to introduce and accelerate the expansion of services that de-risk agricultural 
investments by improving dialogue between private and public actions, increasing the use of private 
sector service delivery (e.g. out-grower schemes and productive partnerships), and expanding access to 
information and financial services. These measures will help achieve a key anticipated outcome from PSTA 
4 and will improve productivity and inclusiveness of agricultural market systems and increase value 
addition and competitiveness of diversified agricultural commodities, for domestic, regional, and 
international markets. 

 

34. Results Area 4: Efficiency in Public Expenditures - aligned with PSTA 4 Priority Area 4. The PforR 
Program seeks to incentivize the dual approach of supporting: (i) a very specific action that demonstrates 
improved efficiency in public expenditure of the core delivery agency RAB; and (ii) a more general effort 
to improve the overall expenditure among the three main agencies that account for the largest share of 
sector expenditure. Since RAB is the agency responsible for key services, improvements in the budget 
execution system will be undertaken with the goal of improving their delivery function. Standards for 
budget execution help to maximize the impact of government spending and the ability to meet such 
standards signals weaknesses that undermines value for money. It also undermines the argument for 
additional public resources since there are associated concerns over malfeasance in execution that render 
MINECOFIN reluctant to allocate additional resources. Previous audits of RAB have not been approved 
because of non-compliance in several important areas. Prior qualified audits have highlighted in detail 
where weaknesses lie and both agencies are aware of where improvements are needed. 

 

35. The implementation of the program will be sequenced.  Specifically, under Result Area 1 MINAGRI 
will develop and seek approval for a Private Sector Leveraging Strategy (with sections on selection criteria 
for private investments, contract governance, and environmental/social management).   Approval of the 
Private Sector Leveraging Strategy will enable MINAGRI to focus on the delivery of Result Areas 2 and 3.  
 

36. The Boundaries of the PforR Program are summarized below in Table 2

37. The Program boundary for PforR financing provides a clear strategic focus to the PforR Program.  
There are areas of PSTA 4 that will not be covered by the PforR Program.  These areas include the 
following: 
 

a. improved soil health and fertility  
b. conservation of biodiversity  
c. skills development 
d. animal resources and production systems  
e. nutrition sensitive agriculture 
f. mechanisms for resilience 
g. quality assurance  
h. knowledge management 

 

38. The rationale for not incorporating these areas in the PforR Program includes the following:  a) 
MINAGRI is in the process of securing both public and external resources for these areas (including 
regional IPF and GASFP), b) these areas are unlikely to provide an equivalent transformation impact and 
c) a number of these areas (e.g. mechanisms for resilience and quality assurance) could not be effectively 
supported by a PforR Program.  

 

39. The PforR Program and its sub-components aim to tackle identified climate risks and 
vulnerabilities as follows: 

• Policy and Organizational Reform. Currently MINAGRI has limited capacity to fulfil its mandate 
in policy development, inter-sector and intra- sector coordination, resource mobilization and 
M&E. The PforR Program will support improving the capability of MINAGRI to properly 
address policy challenges and direct public investments across all GoR. This new capacity will 
result in strengthen regulatory institutions and policies (including rules and regulations) which 
reduce the emissions of GHGs in the agriculture, fishing, livestock, and/or forestry sectors (a 
PAP action), improvements in data management of weather monitoring systems. 

 

• Improved coordination with relevant agencies and actors. The primary focus for the PforR 
Program is to support MINAGRI in becoming a stronger market enabler.  Improving 
interagency working and coordination is a requirement in this process. This improved capacity 
for sectoral collaboration will also be applied toward tackling climate risks and vulnerabilities.

• Commercialization of the delivery of key public goods and services. Most agriculture in 
Rwanda is practiced on steep slopes prone to erosion during the rainy season. While 
considerable progress has been made in constructing robust “bench” (wide) terraces, much 
more needs to be done to secure the land asset.  The PforR Program will support, via the 
efficient use of public funds and leveraged private investments, the restoration and 
conservation of productive landscapes.

crop and livestock pests and 

diseases  

 

DLI 4: Mechanism 

to strengthen 

public private 

dialogue (PPD) and 

specific commodity 

value chain 

platforms designed 

and implemented 

• Two mechanisms designed and budgeted: (1) 
National Public-Private Dialogues (PPD) on 
themes with strategic relevance (2) 
Commodity value chain platforms (year 1) 

• Two national PPDs held and at least 3 VC 
platforms established with operating plans 
(year 2) 

• Additional 2 PPDs held (year 3) 

• VC platforms are fully functional and yielded 
evidence of satisfactory results (as per M&E of 
operating plan) (year 3) 
 

A stronger dialogue between the 

Public and Private Sector 

(including farmer associations 

and other stakeholders) will 

allow for knowledge exchange 

and greater awareness of climate 

risks, and will encourage greater 

consensus and innovation on 

how (exposure to) risks and 

shocks can be reduced and 

managed.

DLI 6: Volume of 

private sector 

investment (in US$) 

matching public 

financing in PPP 

infrastructure 

projects  

The DLI will help to promote new financing 

mechanisms.  Only investments fully committed 

are included in the measure. 

• 4,000,0000 US$ or more (year 2) 

• 7,150,000 US$ or more (year 3) 

Investments will be targeted 

towards infrastructure (e.g. 

greenhouses, drying areas, etc.) 

that is designed to reduced the 

vulnerability of crop storage 

facilities to climate change and 

climate variability. 

 

This investment will also support 

the creation of infrastructure 

that will support improved 

business continuity during and 

after extreme weather events. 

DLI 7: Private 

sector service 

models designed, 

launched and 

achieving positive 

response    

• 6,000 farm households reached by private 
advisory services (non-outgrower scheme) 
(year 2) 

• 8,0000 additional farm households reached by 
private advisory services (non-outgrower-
schemes (year 3) 

• 10,0000 new farm household participating in 
outgrower schemes (Year 3)  

Reduction in the reliance on 

public sector as the key service 

provide will enable MINAGRI to 

refocus resources towards 

supporting farmers who have 

fewer resources to manage 

climate-related risks

40. Role of the Development Partners.  MINECOFIN and MINAGRI will be mobilizing resources to 
finance PSTA 4.  There are indications that DFID, EU, IFAD, and USAID will be providing finance via project 
based financing or programmatic financing. 
 
41. DFID is considering providing support for the PforR Program. Once this is confirmed, the most 
appropriate mechanism for their co-financing will be established (i.e., parallel financing, co-financing, 
establishment of a multi-donor trust fund, etc.). To the extent that other development partners (DPs) 
participate in co-financing the PforR Program, it is understood that their funding would need to fit in the 
overall program envelope under PforR financing and would be allocated to the same DLIs, according to a 
similar pattern of distribution (in agreement with the Common Framework of Engagement (CFE)) of the

MDTF, following all existing procedures of the PforR instrument (i.e., DLIs, verification protocols, PAP, 
Program Implementation). 
 
42. DFID, EU, IFAD, USAID, FAO and the Netherlands will continue to provide Technical Assistance 
(TA) to address the recognized capacity gaps within MINAGRI. These DPs are planning to continue TA 
support over the implementation of PSTA 4.  These same DPs are also part of the Agriculture Sector 
Working Group (ASWG), which provides an important forum to coordinate the complementarity of TA 
interventions, also as part of the annual planning and budgetary processes. Discussions are underway to 
explore the most appropriate modalities to be followed by these DPs, including co-financing the PforR 
operation. Having multiple DPs finance the PforR operation would streamline and reduce transaction 
costs for the Ministry by having one mechanism with agreed upon results and a common set of DLIs. It 
would also simplify the financing to support strategic results, whether policies, impacts, outcomes, and/or 
outputs. DPs who wish to provide co-financing under the proposed PforR operation will follow the same 
procedures as the PforR Program. 

 

C. Proposed Program Development Objective(s)  
 

Program Development Objective(s) 
  
To improve the capacity of selected public agricultural institutions and to enable an increase in commercialization of 
agriculture value chains in Rwanda  
 
 
D. Environmental and Social Effects 

 
43. The physical activities planned under this PforR Program follow the scope and nature of 
activities implemented under the previous PforR operation, and moderate adverse environmental and 
social impacts are anticipated to be site-specific and reversible. Identified impacts can be effectively 
mitigated, based on existing environmental and social systems and the solid recent track record of the 
implementing agencies compliance with both national legislation and World Bank safeguards. No 
anticipated Program activities are judged likely to have significant adverse impacts on the environment 
and/ or affected people that are sensitive, diverse, or unprecedented. However, it is recognized that the 
key sector intuitions, such as, MINAGRI and RAB will require significant capacity building to enhance E&S 
systems and staffing to ensure effective implementation and monitoring of not only public sector, but 
also PPP initiatives.  The capacity enhancement efforts for MINAGRI are included in the PforR operation, 
supported by other Donors. Based on the introduction of the new instruments and new types of 
collaboration with the private sector, the overall environmental and social risks of the PforR Program are 
proposed to be rated as Substantial. 
 

44. The previous PforR operation had several notable achievements, such as the development of a 
consolidated Environmental and Social Implementation Manual based on existing government 
guidelines; and national and district level capacity building on the application of the Manual and the 
establishment of a grievance redress call center. 
 

45. The update of the ESSA is still ongoing to incorporate a sample of the private sector entities and

assess the environmental and social systems as they are applied for potential PPP projects, especially 
focusing on Results Area 2: Enabling Agricultural Commercialization and Results Area 3: Delivery of 
Improved Agric Value Chain Services. 
 

46. Environmental Effects. The PforR Program may include small scale irrigation schemes, similar in 
scale to sub-projects under the IDA-financed Rural Sector Support Project (RSSP; phases 1 – 3), located 
in existing sites of agricultural land use, do not involve large-scale resettlement, and consist of land 
husbandry works (e.g., terracing); drainage canals and/ or dams that are not higher than 10m; post-
harvest infrastructure, markets, and community storage facilities. Based on the experience with 
implementation of support to PSTA III, the potential environmental impacts of Program activities are 
generally well known and understood by implementing authorities at the national and local levels. 
Under the previous PforR operation, MINAGRI has adopted an Environmental and Social Management 
System based on the internationally accepted best practices and more specifically, based on 
implementation of other donor-funded projects, including Bank-financed RSSP and the Land Husbandry, 
Water Harvesting and Hillside Irrigation (LWH) project. This system includes national small dam safety 
guidelines, integrated pest management plans, environmental assessments and grievance redress 
mechanisms database. It is expected that the identified environmental impacts can be: (i) avoided 
through a careful site selection process, which entails conducting feasibility studies, an environmental 
impact assessment (EIA), and social screening; and (ii) reduced with diligent monitoring of 
implementation of known and demonstrated mitigation measures. At the same time, the Program will 
have a number of environmental benefits, including (i) a soil conservation and land husbandry program 
that will contribute to more sustainable land and water management and decreased erosion; and (ii) soil 
fertility management, and advance research and seed production, which will improve agricultural 
practices and increase food security in the country. 
 

47. Social Effects. No significant changes in land use or large-scale land acquisition are expected 
from the proposed PforR. The Program continues to pay specific attention to its potential social impacts, 
based on the practices established under previous PforR operation. These include: a chance of moderate 
physical resettlement and/ or land acquisition related to Program interventions and temporary 
displacement due to land husbandry works; challenges of identifying relocation sites due to the limited 
land availability; loss of income from land due to demarcation of buffer zones; potential for limitations 
on access to natural resource use in or around protected areas; consolidation of land use; acquisition of 
land for agro-processing and off-farm activities; benefit sharing of commercial farming if land is rented; 
male capture of community institutions; obstacles for women and youth participation; difficulty of 
purchasing agriculture inputs for the very poor due to their limited access to micro finance; conflict over 
land ownership and use; and weak participatory decision making and lack of transparency. The Program 
is also expected to have significant social benefits for the rural communities in the target areas, such as 
increased productivity and commercialization of agriculture and improved quality and accessibility of 
agricultural services, thus improving citizens’ incomes and overall welfare and quality of life, especially 
for the rural poor and vulnerable. Based on the approach established during implementation of other 
Bank-supported operations, the Program targets farmer groups with specific attention to gender issues, 
including in group and cooperative leadership, inclusion of vulnerable groups, and training in conflict 
resolution and family welfare.  
 

48. Sustainability. Ensuring environmental and social sustainability of Program investments requires

mainstreaming sustainability planning at all levels of the government, including the continuous 
participation of target communities. Currently, the challenge for the sector institutions under the 
Program is to ensure that decentralized decision making, transparency, and accountability are 
institutionalized to enhance sustainability of investments. This need has been recognized by MINAGRI, 
RAB and participating private sector entities and will receive support from the DPs.  
 

49. Capacity. Institutional arrangements for environmental management, including ESIAs, are 
mandated and established at all levels of government. The legal/regulatory procedures and policies for 
expropriation of land in the country adequately respond to the relocation and compensation for loss of 
assets, services, homes, and land. However, a common challenge is the ineffective implementation of 
these requirements and responsibilities due to lack of institutional capacity and financial resources at 
the local level. The assessment of specific capacity of the private sector is ongoing, however, more 
coordination efforts will need to be made by MINAGRI to ensure effective compliance monitoring of the 
PPP interventions. The capacity-building program will continue from the previous phase and focus on 
improving the environmental and social management practices among the government agencies and 
private sector organizations, including in the areas of: (i) implementation and oversight of the 
environmental and social assessment system within the Program; (ii) sustainability aspects of site 
selection and technical designs of the land husbandry and irrigation activities; (iii) documentation of 
involuntary resettlement and project-affected people and vulnerability assessments, including, where 
necessary, preparation of resettlement action plans (RAPs); (iv) screening of potential environmental 
and social impacts and public consultation; (v) enhancing gender-sensitive capacity building of local and 
national staff and service providers and gender responsiveness in agricultural service delivery; and (vi) 
good monitoring practices, including proactive use of grievance redress mechanisms; sampling of soil 
and water quality, and others.  
 

50. OP 7.50 on International Waterways is triggered as the Program activities will involve water 
extraction for irrigation activities from the streams flowing into international basins of the Nile and Lake 
Tanganyika. Following the practice of the RSSP (phases 1-3), the Bank has notified riparian states as part 
of Program preparation. The Bank has assessed, however, that the proposed activities under the 
Program will not result in any adverse impacts to the riparian countries. Irrigation development and land 
husbandry are not expected to have adverse impacts on water quality levels. Even though agricultural 
intensification and increased use of agricultural inputs are objectives of the Program, pre-Program input 
use levels are very low, and modest increases and sustainability measures built into the Program design 
are not expected to have an adverse impact on water quality. In addition, environmental and pest 
management plans are routinely implemented in the Program to mitigate such impacts to minimal 
levels. The PforR Program will not have any adverse effects on the quantity or quality of water flows to 
any other riparian states. 
 

51. Communities and individuals who believe that they are adversely affected as a result of a Bank 
supported PforR operation, as defined by the applicable policy and procedures, may submit complaints 
to the existing program grievance redress mechanism or the WB’s Grievance Redress Service (GRS). The 
GRS ensures that complaints received are promptly reviewed in order to address pertinent concerns. 
Affected communities and individuals may submit their complaint to the WB’s independent Inspection 
Panel which determines whether harm occurred, or could occur, as a result of WB non-compliance with 
its policies and procedures. Complaints may be submitted at any time after concerns have been brought
