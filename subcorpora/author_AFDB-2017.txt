PROJECT SUMMARY 

 

Project Overview: The Cabinda Province Agriculture Value Chains Development Project 

(CPAVCDP) will provide improved production, produce conservation, storage, processing and 

marketing infrastructure necessary for selected commodity value chains: food crops (cassava, 

banana, sweet potato, peanut, and beans); cash crops (coffee, cocoa and oil palm); marine and inland 

fisheries; small ruminants; and horticulture (vegetables and fruits). The Project will rehabilitate 

water conveyance structures necessary for irrigation; train value chain actors in technical and 

managerial skills; introduce mechanization for land preparation; support adaptive research; and 

improve agricultural extension services. The Project will also rehabilitate or construct rural 

infrastructure, namely feeder roads to link production clusters to markets, agro-processing centers, 

market centers, community health centers, primary schools, potable water facilities in the 

communities and improve rural energy access. The Project will enhance access to improved 

productive resources (improved seed varieties, fish fingerlings, fertilizers, crop protection 

chemicals) through the establishment of a credit facility to be externally administered by World 

Vision International (WVI). The project will be implemented over a four-year period at a total cost 

of USD123.15 million. 

 

Needs Assessment: Angola has made remarkable progress in socio-economic and infrastructure 

development since the end of the 27-year-long civil war in 2002, but more still needs to be done to 

lift majority of its population out of poverty. The sharp and long-lasting decline in oil prices has 

derailed Angola’s economic performance. GDP growth slowed to 0.1% in 2016 down from 4.8% in 

2014. This led to a significant reduction of the nominal GDP to about USD96.2 billion in 2016 from 

USD126.8 billion in 2014. The Government of Angola (GoA) seems increasingly aware of these 

realities and has taken steps to mitigate the impact of the oil price shock on the economy. The 

Government therefore requested assistance from the Bank to strengthen investments in agricultural 

transformation through commodity value chains in order to diversify exports, reduce imports 

through value chains development, increase national revenue sources and reduce dependence on oil.  
 

Value Added for the African Development Bank: The proposed CPAVCD Project fits in with the 

two complementary pillars of Bank’s intervention in Angola in the Country Strategy Paper (CSP, 

2017-2021) as follows: (i) inclusive growth through agricultural transformation; and (ii) support to 

sustainable infrastructure development, in particular, in energy and transport. The Bank Group is 
ideally suited to support Angola through this Project because: (i) the Bank Group has gained useful 

experiences in the development of the agriculture sector in its RMCs and in particular, Angola through 

implementation of similar projects; and (ii) the project is in concordance with the Bank’s High-5 

Priorities with its numerous flagship initiatives that will be brought to bear in this project. The Bank’s 
partnership with other technical and development agencies such as the Consultative Group of 

International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) system, International Fund for Agricultural Development 

(IFAD), World Bank (WB) and others is an asset that the Bank can draw upon. 
 

Knowledge Management: The Project shall develop a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) System based 

on Geographic Information System and computer assisted technology for data collection, compilation 

and presentation. The M&E Specialist will coordinate all results and measurement activities, ensure the 

quality control and provide the necessary capacity building. In using the performance indicators and 

targets specified in the results-based framework, special note would be taken of changes that reflect 

advancement towards the translation of outputs into development outcomes. In developing monitoring 

and planning indicators, they will be sex and age disaggregated. They will be captured using analysis of 

M&E database, supervision missions, mid-term report, and periodic impact assessment and field 

exchange visits of the stakeholders. Knowledge could additionally be spread within the institution by 

showcasing the Project results using the Bank ICT infrastructure (Intranet, short documentaries on Bank 

website, etc.).

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF MANAGEMENT FOR A 

PROPOSED AfDB LOAN OF USD101.07 MILLION TO THE REPUBLIC 

OF ANGOLA FOR THE FINANCING OF THE CABINDA PROVINCE 

AGRICULTURE VALUE CHAINS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT 

(CPAVCDP) 
 

Management hereby submits this report and recommendation for an AfDB loan of USD101.07 

million to finance the Cabinda Province Agriculture Value Chains Development Project 

(CPAVCDP). 

 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE 
 

1.1 Project Linkages with the Country Strategy and Objectives 

 

1.1.1 Angola’s Long Term Plan, dubbed “Vision 2025” articulates the country’s conceptual 

view to achieve sustainable development and seeks to “extricate the country from poverty by 

promoting economic growth, macroeconomic stability and employment”. Vision 2025 was 

designed to be implemented in a period of 25 years, in three stages, with concrete objectives and 

targets and which may be adapted: 2000-2005 (peace, national reconstruction and economic 

growth startup); 2005-2015 (consolidation of national reconstruction, modernization and 

development); and 2015-2025 (sustainability and growth). The National Development Plan 

(NDP) 2013-2017 underscored aspects of the “Vision 2025” by stressing the need to: (i) diversify 

the economy; (ii) invest in infrastructure (in particular, transport, energy and water and 

sanitation); (iii) enhance better management of natural resources; and (iv) expand employment 

opportunities to reduce poverty. The new NDP 2018-2022 that is under preparation is only due 

for approval after the general elections in August 2017. 

 

1.1.2 The recent approved CSP 2017-2021 adopts a broader context of policy continuity by 

anchoring on the longer Vision 2025 of the country. It focuses on two complementary pillars: (i) 

inclusive growth through agricultural transformation; and (ii) support to sustainable 

infrastructure development, in particular energy and transport. The project is aligned to the 

Bank’s Feed Africa – Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in Africa 2016-2025; the Bank 

Group Industrialization Strategy for Africa 2016-2025; the Bank’s Private Sector Development 

Strategy 2013-2017; the Bank Group Strategy for the New Deal on Energy for Africa 2016-

2025; the Bank Group Strategy for Jobs for Youth in Africa 2016-2025; and the Bank Group 

Gender Strategy 2014-2018. Lastly, the CSP is fully aligned to the achievement of Angola’s 

SDGs, in particular, the  SDG 1 (“No poverty”), SDG 2 (“No Hunger”), SDG 5 (“Gender 

equality”), SDG 6 (“Clean water and sanitation”), SDG 7 (“Clean energy”), SDG 8 (“Good jobs 

and economic growth”), SDG 9 (“Innovation and infrastructure”), SDG 10 (“Reduced 

inequalities”), and SDG 13 (“Protect the planet”).  

 

1.2 Rationale for Bank Involvement 

 

1.2.1 In March 2015, a Middle Income Country (MIC) Technical Assistance grant of 

UA420,045 was approved for the Government of Angola to undertake a Study as part of a project 

cycle pre-investment activity. It is noteworthy that the Bank Group had not carried out an 

agriculture sector review in Angola since the Bank Group commenced operations there in 1980. 

The Cabinda Province Agriculture Value Chains Development Project (CPAVCDP) is based 

upon the technical documents produced by the Study.  

 



2 

 

1.2.2 The project fits in with the two complementary pillars of Bank’s intervention in Angola 

in the just approved CSP 2017-2021. The Bank’s strategy focuses on: (i) inclusive growth 

through agricultural transformation; and (ii) support to sustainable infrastructure development, 

in particular, in energy and transport. The agricultural transformation interventions under the 

pillar I are aligned with the Bank’s High 5s priorities of Feed Africa and Industrialize Africa, 

while the infrastructure development interventions under pillar II will help achieve the following 

High 5s: Light-up and power Africa, Integrate Africa and Improve quality of life of Africans. It 

also fulfils the requirement of the Ten-Year Strategy (TYS, 2013-2022) as it pertains to inclusive 

growth objective through the involvement of youth, women and skills development. It is also in 

alignment with Pillar 2 (improving rural infrastructure and trade-related capacities for market 

access) and Pillar 3 (increasing food supply and reducing hunger and malnutrition) of the 

Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Program (CAADP). 

 

1.3 Aid Coordination 

 

Apart from the Bank Group, development partners in the agriculture sector include the World 

Bank and the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD). The World Bank is 

supporting the Angola Market Oriented Smallholder Agriculture Project (MOSSAP) with the 

amount of USD30 million and jointly financed by IFAD with USD8.2 million and a grant of 

USD4 million from the Government of Japan. The Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) has a 

number of agricultural development initiatives with the aim of promoting the sector by providing 

an enabling environment for farmers and processors. One of the strategies is Private-Public-

Partnerships (PPP) in agricultural production. In pursuit of this, US-owned Chiquita Brands 

International recently announced plans to begin growing banana in the southern province of 

Benguela; while Brazilian-owned Odebrecht Africa Fund is investing in sugar and ethanol 

production in Malanje Province. The American company "Ellada Investiments Pty Ltd" is trying 

to invest in the production of coffee in northern Uige province; and China Development Bank is 

financing rice production in Kuando-Kubango province. Other foreign owned companies are 

expected to invest in coffee, sugar, cassava and palm oil production. Tables 1.1a and 1.1b provide 

the details of development partners’ activities in the various sectors.

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
 

2.1 Project Objectives 

 
Development objective  

 

2.1.1 To contribute to increased food and nutrition security, job and wealth creation.  

 

 Specific project objectives 

 

2.1.2 To increase farmers’ food and nutrition security and incomes through increased 

agricultural output and value addition. The Project will also contribute to enhance income of 

small and medium enterprises engaged in input supply, production, processing, storage and 

marketing of selected commodities on a sustainable basis.  

 

Project Components 

 

2.1.3 The proposed CPAVCD Project is composed of three components: (i) Commodity Value 

Chains Development; (ii) Infrastructure Development; and (iii) Project Management and 

Monitoring and Evaluation. The project focuses on the provision of the enabling environment 

for agricultural development and value addition of staple crops (cassava, banana, sweet potato, 

peanut, and beans); cash crops (coffee, cocoa and oil palm); marine and inland fisheries; poultry 

and small ruminants; and horticulture (vegetables and fruits). It will rehabilitate or construct rural 

and resilient infrastructure, namely feeder roads to link production clusters to markets, agro-

processing centers, market centers, community health centers, primary schools, potable water 

facilities in the communities and improve rural energy access. A summary of the activities is in

Table 2.2: Technical Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection 

 

Alternative Solution Brief Description Reasons for Rejection 

1. Instrument: Project vs. sector 

budget support  

Under sector budget support, 

resources are disbursed in tranches 

based on triggers agreed upon 

Assessment of sector fiduciary 

environment was not conclusive and 

had high level of uncertainty 

2. Build in credit administration 

into the project  

Create a unit within the Provincial 

Department of Agriculture to 

administer credit to beneficiaries 

No experience exists within the 

Government institutions to administer 

credit on a sustainable basis 

3. Matching grant for acquisition 

of production inputs and 

machinery 

Beneficiaries are supported with 

matching grants to partially defray 

the cost of acquiring the requisite 

inputs and machinery for 

production / processing activities. 

The mechanism has often not worked 

effectively if beneficiaries are 

expected to provide surety to access 

the credit from participating financial 

institutions. Stringent collateral 

requirements make it challenging to 

take off. 

 
2.3 Project Type 
 

The Cabinda Province Agriculture Value Chains Development Project (CPAVCDP) is an 

investment project financed by an AfDB loan.  

 

2.4 Project Cost and Financing Arrangements

2.4.3 Justification for Local Costs Financing: The AfDB loan of USD101.07 million will 

finance 100% of Goods; 82.91% of Works; 91.35% of Services; 100% of the credit fund; and 

29.01% of recurrent costs. The loan will finance 100% of foreign costs and 60.85% of local 

costs. Despite contributing 16.2% of total costs, the Government of Angola does not have the 

capacity to finance the requisite 50% of total project costs as a result of the current economic 

hardship and fiscal deficit arising from the prolonged decline in oil prices. Consequently, local 

costs have been factored into AfDB financing in order not to delay implementation of activities.  

A waiver request for financing 82.1% of the project cost through an AfDB loan is presented in 

Annex VII. 

 
2.5 Project Area and Beneficiaries 

 

The CPAVCD Project will be implemented in the four municipalities of Cabinda Province 

namely: Belize, Buco Zau, Cacongo and Cabinda with a combined human population of 688,285. 

The direct beneficiaries are the 51,000 economically active smallholders living in the rural areas 

in the four municipalities of Cabinda Province who are already or being encouraged to participate 

in agriculture. The indirect beneficiaries include existing 15 small, medium and large-scale 

entrepreneurs and business associations who provide services to the producers and processors. 

This number is expected to increase significantly when other economically active value chain 

entrepreneurs get involved in the Project. Commodity processors, marketers, agro-dealers in the 



8 

 

province will be engaged. Among the target group, women and youth play a major role in crop 

and animal production, processing, small enterprises operation and marketing. At least 50% of 

beneficiaries (women) will be specifically targeted in project activities and to reap benefits.  

 

2.6 Participatory Approach to Project Formulation, Design and Implementation 
 

During the study stages, cross-sectional consultations were held by the consultants in the four 

municipalities. A general workshop was held on 25 August 2016 in Cabinda city where all 

stakeholders were present. The general outline of the proposed project was presented and 

deliberated upon. The general workshop incorporated both plenary and working group sessions 

that were designed along thematic areas critical for the successful and logical implementation of 

the project. Comments and suggestions were later incorporated in the final documents by the 

consultants. The workshops established the desirability for interventions using the value chain 

approach. The key outcome of the consultation process was a consensus on the Project objective 

and strategy as well as the implementation arrangement. These were further validated during the 

appraisal mission of June 2017 with representatives from key Government agencies such as: IDA 

(Institute of Agrarian Development); ISV (Veterinary Services Institute); IIV (Veterinary 

Research Institute); IDF (Forestry Development Institute); the Provincial Governor of Cabinda 

and farmer cooperative heads in each of the four Municipalities. The consultation process was 

complemented at final briefing sessions with the Director-Generals of the departments, Secretary 

of State for Agriculture and the Minister of Agriculture, as well as with development partners 

such as the World Bank and FAO. The participatory approach adopted during the formulation 

will be continued during its implementation. The implementation arrangement will therefore 

include representatives of key stakeholders such as the existing farmer groups and value chain 

actors in the Project Steering Committee to ensure that their interests are taken into consideration 

at all times.  

 

2.7 Bank Group Experience and Lessons Learnt Reflected in the Project Design 

 

2.7.1 The Bank Group currently has two on-going projects in the agriculture sector as follows: 

(i) Angola Fisheries Sector Support Project (UA20.00 million); and (ii) Environment Sector 

Support Program (UA0.42 million). Though these initiatives offer great potential for agricultural 

and rural development by improving productivity and ensuring sustainable use of natural 

resources, actual implementation has been bogged by institutional and project staffing 

challenges. The Bank’s overall portfolio performance in Angola is deemed unsatisfactory with 

an average score of 2.3 out of 4. The average age of the portfolio is 3.8 years with two projects 

of more than five years foreseen to be completed by the end of 2017. Details are in Annex B1 of 

the Technical Annexes. 

 

2.7.2 The sole agriculture project financed by Bank Group to date was the Bom Jesus-Calenga 

Smallholder Agricultural Development Project (UA17.2 million ADF grant), which ended in 

November 2016. The Project Completion Report indicated that the project met most of its targets 

for rural infrastructural development and economic diversification, but it took nearly twice as 

much time to complete the construction and rehabilitation works. The Bank Group has gained 

useful experiences in the development of the agriculture sector in the country. Key lessons that 

have been learned include: (i) institutional environment under which the project operates needs 

to be optimum so as to avoid unnecessary delays to project implementation; (ii) retention of 

qualified staff is key to core management functions, to ensure timely delivery of outputs, and 

effectively achieve the development goals. It is thus envisaged that the Cabinda Province 

Agriculture Value Chains Development (CPAVCD) Project will have a specific activities on 

institutional development to bring a major transformation of the agriculture sector in Cabinda 

Province. There is no Project Completion backlog in the country.

2.7.3 The Table below summarizes key lessons learnt from closed and on-going agriculture 

sector interventions in the country, and indicates how they have informed the design of 

CPAVCD Project. 

 

Table 2.8: Consideration of Lessons Learnt in Project Design 
 

Lessons learnt  Actions incorporated into the design of CPAVCD 

Project 

The need to ensure a 

geographical focus and that 

resources are not thinly spread 

 

The Bank has adopted a cluster model where production 

and processing are in a closely-knit geographical area as 

opposed to sites in various communes. This would allow 

for optimal use of installed infrastructure and ease of 

technical assistance and supervision activities 

The need for participatory and 

socially inclusive formulation 

and implementation of 

development interventions  

The organization of three workshops that attracted all 

stakeholders and their potential involvement in 

implementing the Project would ensure ownership and 

sustainability after project investment period 

The need for decentralization 

of implementation to the 

Province where the project is 

located using existing organs  

The implementation arrangement of CPAVCD Project is 

located in Cabinda where the actual day-to-day actions are 

taking place. The recruitment of a dedicated PIU will 

ensure efficiency in delivery 

The need to ensure high state 

of readiness for project start up 

and implementation.  

 

The various technical assessments carried out during the 

Study provided the technical, engineering, environmental 

as well as procurement documents that will ensure that 

project will be implemented in a shorter period (four years 

instead the default five).   

 
2.8 Key Performance Indicators 

 

2.8.1  The key performance indicators for monitoring progress in achieving the Project 

objectives are in the results based logical framework (RBLF). These indicators include impacts, 

outcomes and outputs that will be further refined at Project start-up when more information/data 

would be available through revised assessments. Key impact indicators include level of wealth 

created along the value chains (farmers, processors, women, market operators, etc); level of food 

and nutrition security achieved; and number of jobs created. The key outcome indicator is the 

additional income earned by value chain actors.  

 

2.8.2  Outputs indicators on infrastructure development include number of climate resilient 

water control structures rehabilitated; number of wash bore/tube wells constructed, hectares of 

land with supplementary irrigation facilities; increased crop yield and hectares of land put to 

production of the commodities; number of small holders and percentage of them using good 

agronomic practices; percentage of producers trained in technical and managerial skills; and 

percentage of farmers provided with farm advisory services. Other output key indicators for 

processing, market and community development include kilometers of feeder roads 

rehabilitated; number of community markets, storage facilities constructed or rehabilitated; and 

number of social facilities rehabilitated and equipped (schools, clinics, potable water for drinking 

and processing).   

 

2.8.3 Key output indicators for the commodity value chain development include number of 

operational storage facilities and collection centers; percentage of actors trained in post-harvest 



10 

 

technologies, modern food processing, group dynamics and leadership; percentage of farmers’ 

organizations and SMEs undertaking collective marketing and purchasing. Other output 

indicators include market share of local food products vis à vis imported ones; and percentage 

of beneficiaries obtaining credit and paying back on time. Key output indicators for Project 

management include the rate of implementation of the annual work plan, number of supervision 

missions per year and number of technical and financial reports per year, rate of disbursement, 

and timeliness of reports. 

 

III. PROJECT FEASIBILITY 
 

3.1 Economic and financial performance  

 

3.1.1 A financial assessment of the project was undertaken using activity models, and on the 

basis of 2016 market prices. The objective of the financial analysis of the project activities is to: 

(i) assess the commercial viability of the proposed agricultural, livestock and value addition 

enterprises to be funded under the project; and (ii) to provide a basis for the economic analysis 

of the project. The analysis focuses on crops, livestock and aquaculture production modules and 

various agro-processing enterprises. These analyses were carried-out with financial and 

economic costs generated using Costab 32. Summary of financial and economic analysis is in 

Annex B7 and further elaborated in Annex B7 in Volume II of the appraisal report. 

 

3.1.2 The CPAVCD Project will contribute to the improvement of socio economic indicators 

especially on reduction of poverty and malnutrition, maternal and child health, reduced child 

literacy, improved schooling rate of children especially girls due to improved communication 

through rehabilitated roads, provision of schools and community health centers. 

 

       Table 3.1: Key economic and financial figures* 

 

FIRR : 19%  NPV (base case) is USD 204,698,612  

 

EIRR : 23%  NPV (base case)  is USD 317,656,845 
    

*NB: detailed calculations are available in Annex B7 

  

 Financial analysis  
 

3.1.3 Based on the above assumptions, the aggregate financial benefits from agricultural 

production and processing activities when computed against the investment costs for the project 

activities generated Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) of 19% and Net Present Value 

(NPV) of USD 204.70 million. Based on the above analysis, the project is deemed financially 

feasible. The FIRR of 19% is higher than the opportunity cost of capital (12%). 

 

 Economic analysis 
 

3.1.4 The Economic Analysis is carried out to determine the impact of the proposed project to 

the economy as a whole, to justify Government intervention with public funds. The economic 

analysis includes most quantifiable incremental costs and benefits that are associated with the 

project's investments.  

 

3.1.5 The economic analysis was conducted using the similar approach as the financial 

analysis, on the basis of shadow prices (prices in conditions of the efficient market operation) of 



11 

 

tradable goods and total cost of project. In addition, other indirect benefits were also expected, 

such as, easy access to markets through market linkages; easy transportation of goods and 

services, better health delivery systems, improvement in literacy and employment generation. 

However, these additional benefits were difficult to value in monetary terms due to the limited 

scope of this report and data limitations, hence they could not be adequately captured in the 

analysis. In these conditions, the economic analysis yielded an NPV of USD317.66 million and 

Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) of 23% as captured in the technical annexes. 

 

3.2 Environment and Social Impact 

 

3.2.1 Environment  

 

3.2.1.1 The proposed Cabinda Province Agricultural Value Chains Development project was 

classified Category 2 (validated 9th June 2017) because the project activities are expected to have 

minimal and site-specific environmental and social impacts. The project will finance 

construction and rehabilitation of small irrigation scheme, processing and storage facilities, and 

community infrastructure (heath care centers, schools and water supply and sanitation) as well 

as support activities for increased production and commercialization. These impacts can be 

managed with the application of mitigation measures elaborated in site-specific environmental 

and social management plans (ESMPs). The ESMP that was prepared in September 2016 by the 

Cabinda Province Agriculture Development Study consultants for the general project 

intervention areas will be fine-tuned for specific sites during project implementation; hence, an 

environmental and social management framework (ESMF, which was posted on the Bank’s 

website on 11th August 2017) will provide the framework for managing the environment and 

social issues and guide the preparation of environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) 

and/or ESMP as required during project implementation.  

 

3.2.1.2 The anticipated negative impacts are those associated with the construction and/or 

rehabilitation works and the agricultural production and value-chain development activities 

including  (i) loss of vegetation cover due to site clearing, soil erosion, landscape degradation 

and possible habitat fragmentation, (ii) noise, vibration and emissions from operation of 

machinery that may impair air quality and induce health implications, (iii) increased use of 

agrochemicals including pesticides and fertilizers, and (iii) wastes generated from processing 

and marketing facilities. These impacts are site specific and readily managed with the application 

of well-defined measures elaborated in site-specific ESIAs/ESMPs such as (i) refilling the 

exposed or excavated soil soon after completion of works and avoiding or minimizing 

compaction of soils, (ii) ensuring environmental flow for rivers/lakes, (iii) establishing 

sustainable water management systems, and (iv) capacity building of value chain actors to 

promote good agriculture practices, improved agriculture technologies such as integrated soil 

fertility management (ISFM), integrated pest management (IPM) and Waste-to Energy.  

 

3.2.1.3 Overall, the CPAVCDP will have significant positive impacts such as improved 

production, and competitiveness of selected agricultural commodities that will contribute to 

increased income opportunities for value chain actors, and support the local economy of the 

Cabinda province. 

  

3.2.2 Climate change 

 

The Cabinda province experiences seasonal variability of rainfall. Studies indicate that the 

province is susceptible to sea level rise, with a projection of 0.13 – 0.56m by the 2090s. Sea level 

rise can aggravate flooding events causing riverbank erosion, saltwater intrusion, infrastructure 

damages, crop failure, fisheries destruction, and loss of biodiversity. This has significant 



12 

 

implications on livelihoods of agricultural, pastoral and fisheries communities. The Project has 

been assessed Category 2 per the Climate Safeguard Screening Systems requiring the 

implementation of adaptation measures to increase the resilience of communities and the 

infrastructure to be rehabilitated to withstand the impacts of climate change. The project will 

address the potential climate risk through the implementation of practical risk mitigation and 

adaptation measures. Specifically, water harvesting technologies, and rehabilitation and 

improvement of water infrastructure to reduce the dependency on rainfall for agricultural 

activities. Furthermore appropriate measures including physical structures will be implemented 

to reduce coastal degradation as well as protect ecosystems at risk from other hazards that 

accompany floods, and land use changes. This includes construction of gabions and rip rap 

concrete pillars at Landana beach to mitigate coastal erosion; reconstruction of the existing pier 

at Landana; construction of a small floating pier for fishing boats; as well improvement of the 

irrigation and drainage schemes. The Project will prioritize the implementation of adaptations 

measures as identified in Angola’s National Adaptation Program for Action (NAPA for 

agriculture, pastoral and fisheries systems). Implementation will be monitored through the 

inclusion of appropriate indicators in the project monitoring and evaluation framework. 

Furthermore engineering designs will integrate the need to raise drainage datum and camber 

access roads to the required levels to mitigate effect of floods in order to enhance resilience of 

the infrastructure. Overall, the project promote climate smart agriculture through the use of 

improved agricultural technologies and conservation agricultural practices as a means to enhance 

the resilience of the farming systems. It is estimated that USD7.40 million (or 7.2%) of the loan 

would be used on the above mentioned activities and is considered as climate finance portion of 

the loan.  

 

3.2.3 Green Growth 
 

CPAVCD Project has been designed in congruence with the Green Growth principle of “quality 

and inclusiveness of growth”. The Project design is flexible enough to address existing and 

emerging development challenges (rapid population growth, urbanization, shifting consumption 

patterns, uneven economic growth, lack of energy access, and limited access to value addition 

by processing. The Project has been designed to be more holistic in that it has integrated 

economic, social and environmental concerns for overall improvement of human well-being in 

the Province. The Project has further considered solutions to the impact of environmental 

changes, such as land degradation, disaster risk and climate change. 

 

3.2.4 Gender  

 

Structural transformation of Africa’s agriculture is a prerequisite for enhancing agricultural 

productivity, food security and poverty reduction on the continent. However, a critical ingredient 

of such a transformation is gender equality, given its potential impact on social inclusion and 

employment generation. Unfortunately, available evidence reveals that Angola’s agricultural 

landscape is characterized by gender inequalities disproportionately against women. These 

gender-based differences ranged from access to productive resources, low rates of technology 

adoption to economic capacities and incentives. This project will address some of the gender 

inequalities in agricultural productivity, by reducing or closing women’s deficits in agriculture 

performance and will unlock women and youth’s productivity potential. The indirect effects 

include increases in female managers’ bargaining power and improvements in their social status 

as their earnings increase, better child nutrition, health, and education attainment in households 

with female-managed plots.  There is a large gap between men and women in terms of income, 

access to basic services (energy, water and sanitation), access to housing, land, credit and 

continuing education in the Cabinda Province. The project will also contribute to the 

improvement of socio economic indicators especially the Sustainable Development Goals on 



13 

 

reduction of poverty, maternal and child health, reduced adult illiteracy, improved schooling rate 

of children especially girls due to improved access roads. With gender integrated value chains, 

the project will achieve competitive domestic food supply and increase the income levels of 

farmers, processors and marketers. Through improved agricultural production, productivity and 

market linkages, expected impact include food and nutrition security, creation of jobs, of which 

women and youths account for about 50%, along the commodity value chains. For inclusivity, 

the project shall ensure professional training, access to credit and other resources to women and 

youth; facilitate acquisition of machinery and equipment among women and youth; and provide 

capacity building (agribusiness and entrepreneurial, etc.) for women and youth amongst other 

activities.   

 

3.2.5 Social Impact 

 

3.2.5.1 As the project intends paying particular attention to women as well as mechanizing and 

enhancing the agricultural processes and products, drudgery will be removed, more women will 

be empowered, more jobs created and nutrition status significantly improved in the intervention 

areas. Access to safe water and adequate sanitation in Angola is quite poor particularly in rural 

areas. This negatively affects the health status of the population, school enrolment and retention 

especially for the girl-child, agricultural productivity and poverty status of the people in general. 

The Project will drill boreholes and construct sanitary facilities in public places such as markets, 

schools and health facilities in an effort to contribute to improvement of the hygiene situation. 

 

3.2.5.2 The expected increased commercial activities particularly around the warehousing, and 

processing facilities and markets with increased influx of people of diverse cultures, beliefs and 

behaviors is likely to expose people to sexually transmitted infections such as HIV/AIDS. The 

Project shall therefore design sensitization and capacity building activities to address these health 

issues. The actions envisaged include: (i) community sensitization on good nutrition and hygiene 

practices as well as prevention and management of malaria and HIV/AIDS; (ii) improving access 

to health facilities by way of extending the feeder roads to them; (iii) rehabilitation and equipping 

community health facilities; and (iv) skills training for health care providers. 

 

3.2.5.3 In order to accommodate all these activities a total of USD34.09 million has been 

earmarked for the provision of social infrastructure such as schools, clinics, potable water and 

sanitation systems for the beneficiaries. Community mobilization and training on nutrition, 

conflict resolution and health issues have been estimated at USD5.63 million. It is also estimated 

that USD17.65 million (or 45%) of these sums will target women. 

 

3.2.6 Involuntary Resettlement 

 

There is no involuntary resettlement or land acquisition or any loss, by the population, of 

property, sources of income and livelihoods envisioned within the implementation of the Project 

activities. The project interventions will be implemented on existing agriculture and pastoral 

systems.  

 

IV- PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION 

 

4.1 Implementation Arrangements 

 

4.1.1 The Ministry of Agriculture will be the executing agency of the project. Based on the 

weaknesses identified in the agriculture project that just ended and lessons distilled by the Bank 

from its experience in implementing programs in the country, the management of the CPAVCD 



14 

 

Project emphasizes a highly decentralized but inclusive structure. At the National Level, a lightly 

staffed National Project Coordination Unit (NPCU) will be established at MINAGRI in Luanda 

to coordinate project activities in Cabinda Province and also to carry out key policy and 

institution back stopping at the Ministry of Agriculture as well as disbursement and reporting 

liaison with the Bank. The NPCU will be headed by a national Project coordinator (NPC) and 

staffed by a liaison officer, a secretary and a driver. The staff of the NPCU will be paid from the 

proceeds of the loan. Furthermore, a Project Implementation Unity (PIU) will be competitively 

recruited as a consulting firm to manage the project and be based in Cabinda town itself. The 

PIU will comprise eight key officers as follows: (i) Project Manager; (ii) Financial Manager; (iii) 

Civil Engineer; (iv) Agro-processing Specialist; (v) Financial Accountant; (vi) Procurement 

Expert; (vii) M&E Officer; and (viii) Credit Management Specialist. The setting up of the PIU 

will be retained as a condition precedent to disbursement.  

 

4.1.2 The Government will provide full time counterpart staff to understudy the consultants 

and IDA (Institute of Agrarian Development) will take over the management of the project after 

two and a half years. The Gender Expert at the Office of the Provincial Governor of Cabinda 

will assume the leadership and responsibility for all gender related aspects of the Project and will 

engage with national NGOs for support. This arrangement will provide in-house training and 

sustainability upon the exit of the consultants. The Government counterpart specialists will 

receive a predetermined monthly allowance as incentive. The existing Provincial Director of 

Agriculture shall provide oversight function on the implementation of the Project in Cabinda 

Province represented by Agricultural Development Stations in each Municipality. 

 

4.1.3 A Project Steering Committee (PSC) will be established to provide policy guidance to 

the project. The PSC will be responsible to the Minister of Agriculture. The PSC will be chaired 

by the Minister of Agriculture and will comprise a representative (of not lower than the grade of 

Director) each from IDA (Institute of Agrarian Development); ISV (Veterinary Services 

Institute); Ministry of Women and Youth; Ministry of Environment; Ministry of Finance; 

Ministry of Fisheries; Office of the Provincial Governor of Cabinda; and Departments of 

Agriculture; Forestry; and Water from Cabinda Province. A representative of the farmer apex 

cooperative association will also be in the PSC. The PSC will approve work plans and budget 

estimates for activities and monitor reports of project implementation. The organogram for 

Project implementation is presented in Annex II.  

 
 Procurement Arrangement  

 

4.1.4 Procurement of goods and works and the acquisition of consulting services, financed by 

the Bank for the project, will be carried out in accordance with the “Procurement Policy for 

Bank Group Funded Operations”, dated October 2015 and following the provisions stated in the 

Financing Agreement. Specifically, Procurement will be carried out following: 

 

 BPS – Borrower Procurement System: Specific Procurement Methods and Procedures 
(PMPs) under BPS comprising its Laws and Regulations as set forth in the Public Contracts 

Law No. 9/16 of 16 June 2016 and related implementing regulations, using the national 

Standard Solicitation Documents (SSDs) or other SDs agreed during project negotiations. 

Procurement of (i) construction of abattoirs for an estimated total amount of UA 343,360, 

(ii) construction of processing centers for an estimated amount of UA 455,500, (iii) vehicles 

for an estimated total amount of UA 350,080 and (iv) furniture for an estimated total amount 

of UA 197,910 (iii) will be procured using BPS. 

 



15 

 

Bank PMPs: Bank standard PMPs, using the relevant Bank Standard or Model Solicitation 

Documents, will be used for the procurement of works and goods and for the selection of 

consultants under the project. Works procured using Open Competitive Bidding (OCB) through 

International Competitive Bidding include : (i) construction of four clinics for an estimated total 

amount of UA780,000; (ii) construction of four schools for an estimated total amount of 

UA1,200,000; (iii) construction of one irrigation scheme for an estimated total amount of 

UA2,627,440, (iv) drainage works for an estimated total amount of UA1,833,000; (v) 

construction of a greenhouse for an estimated total amount of UA821,000; (vi) construction of 

pier (landing sites) for an estimated total amount of UA4,077,390; (vii) construction of 

warehouses for an estimated total amount of UA518,900; (viii) construction of residences for an 

estimated total amount of UA1,097,890; (ix) other infrastructures for an estimated total amount 

of UA873,750; (x) construction of Belize roads for an estimated total amount of UA10,126,900 

(with prequalification); (xi) construction of Buco Zau roads for an estimated total amount of 

UA5,183,140; (xii) construction of Cacongo roads for an estimated total amount of 

UA6,267,890; and (xiii) construction of Cabinda municipality roads for an estimated total 

amount of UA18,007,710 (with prequalification) . Goods procured using Open Competitive 

Bidding (OCB) through International Competitive Bidding include equipment related to the 

constructions for an estimated total amount of UA3,110,530. The selection of: (i) a Project 

Implementation Unity (PIU) in charge of the implementation of the project, for an estimated 

total amount of UA2,020,070; (ii) service for support to product marketing by NGOs, for an 

estimated total amount of UA291,970; (iii) two consulting firms for review of designs, for an 

estimated total amount of UA1,391,350; and (iv) three contracts for supervision of the works, 

for an estimated total amount of UA3,708,690 will be carried out using the Quality and Cost 

Based Selection (QCBS) method. The selection of audit services, for an estimated total amount 

of UA218,980, will be carried out using the Least Cost Selection (LCS) method. A policy 

advisor, for an estimated total amount of UA289,050, will be recruited using the Individual 

Consultant (IC) selection method. The personnel for the National Coordination Unit will be 

selected through selection of individual consultant method, for an estimated amount of 

UA466,860. The Bank Group has approved that a Memorandum of Understanding should be 

signed with World Vision International for the administration of the credit facility, and with a 

consideration of administration fee estimated at UA182,000. WVI has a well-established 

expertise in a wide range of technical sectors including agriculture, health and nutrition, water 

and sanitation, education, etc. in Angola since 1989 also has experience utilising credit funds 

from the Bank and other development partners.  

 

4.1.5 Advance procurement: Advance procurement mechanism will be used to select the 

project management team (project implementation unit – PIU), in order to be in place at project’s 

start. The establishment of the PIU will be a loan condition. 

 

4.1.6 Procurement Risks and Capacity Development: Country, Sector, Executing Agency 

(EA), and Project procurement risk assessments were undertaken for the project and the output 

have informed the decisions on the procurement regimes (BPS, Bank or Third party) and the 

PMPs being used for specific transactions or groups of similar transactions under the project. 

The appropriate mitigation measures and costs have been included in the procurement capacity 

development action plan (CDAP) under the project. The resources, capacity, expertise and 

experience of the Executing Agency, the Institute of Agrarian Development (IDA), are 

inadequate to carry out the procurement, as it has little experience in implementing Bank-funds 

operations and do not have procurement professionals conversant with Banks and national 

procedures. Most of the issues/risks associated with the procurement components for 

implementation of the project have been identified and include: (i) lack of capacity at the EA 

side, and (ii) weaknesses at sector level (agriculture sector, cooperatives), although some 

capacity exist for execution of smaller works and supply of vehicles and basic equipment and 



16 

 

furniture. The corrective measures which have been agreed are: (i) recruit a private project 

implementation unity (PIU), which will include procurement responsibilities; (ii) this project 

management team will prepare a project procedures manual and train appointed IDA 

staff/counterpart; and (iii) all the executing agency staff will receive adequate procurement 

orientation to enhance their procurement and project management capacity, as part of the project 

launching and during its implementation. It is expected that appointed IDA staff will take over 

the private service provider at mid-term project implementation. Detailed assessment and 

mitigations measures can be found in the Technical Annexes B.5. 

 

 Financial Management 
 

4.1.7 An assessment of the IDA (Institute of Agrarian Development) in the Ministry of 

Agriculture at the Cabinda Provincial level as Project Executing Agency (that included a review 

of the budgeting, accounting, treasury systems, internal controls, and reporting and external audit 

arrangements) was done to ascertain effective financial management of the project.  The current 

financial management of resources managed by IDA at provincial level is primarily for small 

value operating expenditures from periodic transfers made from the National office in Luanda. 

Basic manual records are maintained by an administration staff with no formal reporting and 

specific bank account maintained. At national level, the department of finance (within the 

Finance and Administrative Department at the Ministry of Agriculture) is responsible for the 

function of planning and budgeting including recording expenditures and maintaining assets 

through the use of the Government wide IFMIS (Sistema Integrado de Gestiiodas Finanqas do 

Estado) (SIGFE). The staff receive training in finance and accounting from the Ministry of 

Finance and can manage the accounting for the smaller and recurring nature of some operating 

expenses given their experience with other donor financed projects. However, given the 

complexity and size of the project to be implemented at provincial level, the existing FM capacity 

do not fully meet the Bank’s minimum requirements to ensure financial resources to be made 

available under the project would be used for the intended purposes. In this regard there is need 

for technical assistance in ensuring not only the effective financial management of the project 

but also in capacity building of the finance department at IDA. A Project Implementation Unit 

(PIU) will be competitively recruited as a consulting firm to implement the project, including 

financial management responsibilities and also training government staff with the Ministry of 

Agriculture, through IDA having the overall responsibility of overseeing its implementation.   

 

4.1.8 The project financial management activities will therefore be done by the PIU under the 

oversight of the NPCU that will include a competent accountant whose specific duties shall be 

to ensure a sustained existence of a satisfactory system of accounting, reporting and proper 

record keeping of all documentation to permit a timely production of complete and accurate 

financial reports. The finance staff in the firm will work together with the government 

counterpart finance staff that will be designated to the project at the province to enable transfer 

of skills and offering substantial operational benefits to Angola in terms of contribution to 

capacity development in order to enable them eventually take over project FM. Training in Bank 

requirements regarding financial management will be given as part of project launching and 

during its implementation. Given, the proposed arrangements, the overall FM risk for the project 

is assessed as Substantial with the risk mitigated through the putting in place of the PIU that will 

be responsible for project implementation. The detailed FM assessment including the financial 

management responsibilities of the PIU are attached in Annex B4. 

 

4.1.9 The NPCU will have overall responsibility for ensuring compliance with the Bank’s 

reporting requirements, regarding the submission of periodic progress reports with financial 

information for the Bank loan and Government contributions to the Bank within 45 days after 

the end of the respective quarter. The NPCU in liaison with the PIU will submit quarterly interim 



17 

 

unaudited financial reports covering their activities, as well as the related annual financial 

statements. The PIU will produce a project implementation manual, which will include 

comprehensive financial management procedures, describing the detailed financial procedures 

in processing, budgeting, recording, reporting and auditing of the financial transactions of the 

Project. Furthermore, external audits for the project will be done annually in accordance with a 

Bank approved audit Terms of Reference. The project external audits will be done by private 

auditors and the audit reports (including management letter) submitted to the Bank within six 

months after the end of the respective period covered by the audit with the costs of the audit 

borne by the Loan.  

 

Disbursements 

 

4.1.10 Disbursement of funds under the project shall be primarily by the Direct Payment method 

for the activities under the project. The PIU will be responsible for certification of invoices 

submitted by other service providers or contractors and preparation of disbursement application 

which will be reviewed at the NPCU and signed off by the Government designated staff and 

submitted to the Bank for payment. The Special Account method to be managed by the NPCU 

will however be used for financing the smaller and recurring nature of some operating expenses. 

The opening of a Special Account denominated in United States Dollars together with the 

associated local currency account in Angola Kwanzas at National level will be required before 

disbursement of loan proceeds. The Reimbursement method of disbursement will also be 

available.  All disbursements under the Loan will be made in accordance with the Bank’s rules 

and procedures as laid out in the Disbursement handbook as applicable. In addition, a 

Disbursement letter will be agreed upon as part of the Loan negotiations. 

 

4.2 Monitoring  

 

4.2.1 The foundation for the overall project monitoring and evaluation systems will be the 

logical framework, a series of key performance indicators and project operational manual (POM) 

which will be prepared by the PIU shortly after project loan approval. IDA will monitor overall 

operations for planning and facilitation purposes for the production aspects of the project, 

implementation of the drainage and roads infrastructure for attainment of national standards. The 

PIU will monitor and evaluate overall impact of the project and compile the project’s quarterly 

and annual reports for dissemination to the Bank Group, IDA, other line ministries, and the 

Cabinda Provincial Directorate of Agriculture. A mid-term review (MTR) will be undertaken 

two years after project start to review the project’s achievements and constraints. Similarly, upon 

completion of project investments at the end of project year four, the PIU will prepare a 

Borrower’s project completion report.  

 

4.2.2 The initial assessment of national capacity indicates a satisfactory rating. The Office of 

Planning and Statistics (GEPE) of the Ministry of Agriculture will be used to assess the 

contribution of the project towards the country and province’s development goals and objectives 

as defined in the relevant development plans. The baseline values were drawn from the NDP 

2013-2017, and the results framework of Bank’s new projects. In using the performance 

indicators and targets specified in the results-based framework, project implementers tracking 

progress towards project results are expected to take special note of changes that reflect 

advancement towards the translation of outputs into development outcomes. In developing 

monitoring and planning indicators, they will be disaggregated by sex and age. The key functions 

of the M&E Officer in the PIU will be to ensure quality and accountability of monitoring; 

information management; facilitation of knowledge building; and knowledge sharing on 

monitoring and evaluation. 

 



18 

 

4.2.3 The RBLF will form the basis for measuring outputs, outcomes and impact. Supported 

by the M&E Specialist, the PIU will prepare: (i) Annual Work Program and Budgets; (ii) 

Quarterly Progress Reports; (iii) Mid-year Progress Reports; (iv) Annual Progress Reports; (v) 

Status Reports for Supervision Missions; (vi) Mid-term Review Report; and (vii) Project 

Completion Report.  

 
4.3 Governance 

 

Based on Bank’s experience in implementing projects in Angola, the existing governance 

practices and controls have been deemed satisfactory. The implementation of CPAVCD Project 

requires good governance at all levels from the national to provincial to commune levels. This 

is in relation to better responsiveness, transparency, accountability and efficiency in the use of 

resources. Hence, the institutional arrangement has been designed to ensure good governance, 

and will serve as an instrument for achieving Project objectives.  

 

4.4 Sustainability  

 

The ownership of CPAVCD Project is made manifest by the roles that various stakeholders 

played during formulation and preparation of the Project. As the coordinator of the Study that 

gave rise to this project the Ministry of Agriculture put up a technical team of experts both in 

Luanda and Cabinda to review the various reports produced by the consultants. The intense 

interest of the Governor of Cabinda Province in this project was made manifest during the 

workshop during which she appointed her economic advisor as the focal point for the Province. 

The maintenance of the access roads and municipal infrastructure will be included in the annual 

recurrent budget of the Province as is done nationwide. The present Project will build capacities 

of the Provincial agricultural officers in agri-business management to ensure profitability for the 

value chain actors.  

 

4.5 Risk Management 

 

The current agricultural policy and sectoral strategies of Angola have been developed in a 

consultative manner with the full participation of all relevant stake holders. The Bank Group will 

engage in constant policy dialogue to ensure that the policy, institutional and funding 

(particularly public expenditure) environment remain conducive to agricultural growth and 

development. It is expected that the proposed project will contribute to reducing unemployment 

and poverty, particularly among the youth, and thereby directly mitigate some of the main 

underlying factors of social conflict. Furthermore, social risks will be reduced through gender-

sensitive approaches and ensuring that the poor are not excluded from project benefits. 

CPAVCDP is a category II intervention and will require an environmental, social and health 

impact assessment. The ESIA and ESMPs have been prepared as part of the Study and will be 

fine-tuned for specific project sites during implementation and to be examined as well by the 

Bank. The following is the main risk identified and with its mitigation measures.

4.6 Knowledge Building 

 

Knowledge building will be vital to the success of the Project. Considering the new approach in 

agricultural commodity value chains development, the results of the Project will be monitored 

closely. Knowledge will be built on the evolving concept of decentralized implementation unit 

located in the Province; the role of value chain actors including farmers and farmers’ 

organization, women, youth, private sector, commercial and public sector. Knowledge will be 

captured using analysis of M&E database, supervision missions, mid-term reports, and periodic 

impact assessments and field exchange visits of the stakeholders within and outside the 

production clusters. In addition, knowledge would be disseminated by showcasing the Project 

results using Bank’s communication systems (Intranet, short documentaries on Bank website, 

etc.). The Farmer Field Schools will serve as sources of innovative knowledge and information 

sharing learning tools empowering farmers and other actors of the value chain to train their peers, 

share knowledge and experiences, thus reducing their overdependence on the public extension 

agents. This will also expand significantly the number of value chain actors having access to the 

disseminated knowledge and information. The technical assistance supports will introduce and 

consolidate knowledge and skills, and facilitate technology and skills transfer both at the 

community and national levels.

Project Summary  
 

General overview of the project: The Support to Agriculture Transformation in the Bugesera 

Natural Region Project (PATAREB) covers Bugesera natural region comprising seven (07) 

municipalities in Kirundo Province and Gitreranyi municipality in Muyinga Province. These 

municipalities cover an area of 2 100 km ², that is 7,5 % of the national territory, and has a 

population of 1 004 907 inhabitants (2017 estimates), 519 665 of them women, or more then 

51,71% of the population within the project intervention zone (PIZ). The project targets 

economically, socially and environmentally fragile and disadvantaged communities, who 

possess significant agricultural and fish farming potential  and whose sustainable development 

will contribute to improving food and nutritional security, increase the income of vulnerable 

small-scale producers, alleviate the impact of poverty on rural households and strengthen the 

resilience of populations, including women and youth.  With a total cost of UA 12.00 million, 

fully funded from Pillar I (additional support) resources of the Transition Support Facility 

(TSF), the project will be implemented over a five-year period in  three (03) components: (i) 

Support to Agricultural Infrastructure Development; (ii) Promotion of Agricultural 

Transformation and Improvement of the Living Conditions of inhabitants; and (iii) 

Management and Coordination. PATAREB will directly benefit more than 650,000 people, 

51% of them women, and approximately 355 000 residents within the area of intervention. In 

order to ensure sustainability of investments, the participative and inclusive approach adopted 

during preparation and evaluation will continue during execution in order to associate all the 

recipients and to allow the durability of the investments. Similarly, an innovative approach to 

participative development of agricultural values chains and streams will be adopted to address 

the key constraints to durable financing of agricultural entrepreneurship within the framework 

of public-private partnerships (PPP) and improve the access to markets, guaranteeing a better 

price for producers. 

 

Needs Assessment: Burundi's agricultural sector engages more than 94% of the active 

population and accounts for more than 39% of the GDP, more than 80% of foreign exchange 

earnings and provides 95% of the dietary intake. It also accounts for 25% of government 

spending. The financing needs of the sector were estimated at approximately BIF 145 billion 

during the evaluation mission, to achieve the objectives of the National Plan for agricultural 

investment (NAIP-2012-2017) in terms of increased production and productive capital, 

organization of producers, developing profitable sectors and strengthening institutions 

providing technical support to rural areas. In 2017, the resources are estimated to be BIF 59.28 

billion, a significant deficit of over BIF 85.70 billion. The TSF resources, approximately BIF 

29.28 billion, will help to significantly reduce the financing gap, especially in the eight (08) 

municipalities in Kirundo and Muyinga Provinces. Moreover, the control of water for irrigation 

in the project area requires significant resources, as well as the dissemination of new 

technologies, creation of added value in the main agricultural sectors, sustainable promotion of 

young agricultural entrepreneurs, and strengthening resilience of socio-ecological systems. 

 

Added value for the African Development Bank: PATAREB supports the Bank's Ten Year 

Strategy 2013-2022 and the priority intervention areas funded by TSF in Burundi will support 

food and nutritional security, value chains and strengthen resilience. In particular, the project 

will contribute to reducing the Agricultural Financing Gap, serving as a catalyst for agricultural 

development of the area, by promoting a better control of water, reinforcing economic 

infrastructures, promoting appropriate technologies for food production, processing and 

marketing. In addition, PATAREB reinforces the Bank’s role in financing the agricultural 

sector in Burundi while taking into account the Bank's previous experience in similar projects. 

Lastly, it implements the Bank strategy to “remedy fragility and reinforce resilience in Africa 



 

iv 

 

2014-2019” by consolidating the role of communities, the private sector, and local NGOs in 

reinforcing resilience, local governance and citizen monitoring. This intervention will help build 

resilience and reduce situations of fragility that characterize the targeted Provinces. The project is 

also aligned to the Bank's Gender Strategy 2014 - 2018, in strengthening their right to ownership 

of developed land, economic empowerment through income generation and strengthening their 

capacity in management and in entrepreneurship. 

 

Knowledge management PATAREB will establish a baseline for land surveys (including on 

value chains), which will serve to establish a reliable database, disaggregated by gender, to 

measure results indicators and the impact of the project. A geo-referenced map will be created 

to provide information on developed sites and completed infrastructure. Specific impact 

assessment studies (quick and in-depth) will be carried out by competent firms and the results 

will feed into the project database. This information will be made available on a web site and 

will be shared with all stakeholders. The project will also support training and capacity building 

for diverse local actors, including, in the first instance, farmers within the reclaimed wetlands 

and women in charge of processing and marketing food products. The project will seek to 

disseminate good practices for conservation and storage of agricultural products. In the field of 

irrigation, the project will develop expertise in hillside irrigation using solar energy, and 

resilience to climate change, disseminating innovative actions promoting local know-how, 

including by women. Communication mechanisms and capitalization of project outcomes, 

value addition processes benefiting women and youth through development of value chains, as 

well as participatory assessment and evaluation by the civil society integrated within the project 

implementation mechanism, is part of knowledge management.

PROPOSAL AND RECOMMENDATION OF MANAGEMENT TO THE BOARDS OF 

DIRECTORS OF THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK GROUP CONCERNING  

A TRANSITION SUPPORT FACILITY GRANT TO THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI 

TO FINANCE THE SUPPORT TO AGRICULTURE TRANSFORMATION IN THE 

BUGESERA NATURAL REGION PROJECT (PATAREB) 
 

Management submits this proposal for a UA 12 million TSF grant to the Republic of Burundi, 

to finance the Support to Agriculture Transformation in the Bugesera Natural Region Project 

(PATAREB). 

 

I. Strategic Orientation and justification 
 

1.1. Linkages with the Country's Strategy and Goals 
 

1.1.1.  PATAREB is in line the implementation framework strategy of Government overall 

development policy, as captured in the "Burundi Vision 2025" document and in the 2 phase of 

strategic framework for growth and poverty reduction (PRSP II). At the sector level, it  at the 

same time supports implementation of the national Plan for agricultural investment (NAIP) 

linked to Burundi's National Agricultural Strategy (NAS)  of the implementation of the national 

policy on social protection, as well as the national employment policy These strategies aim at 

a high and inclusive growth likely to promote  improvement in the quality of life of vulnerable 

populations, by addressing food and nutritional security constraints, increasing incomes and 

creating employment particularly for the youth, by making agriculture more attractive. In 

addition to structural investments in water control, development of wetlands and afforestation 

of ridges, the project will contribute to the development of agricultural value chains targeted 

through new growth areas in Bugesera region and taking into account agro-industrial needs 

(rice, maize, sorghum, horticultural products, fish), as well as strengthening household 

resilience towards climate change. The project will also contribute directly to the objectives of 

the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) of Agenda 2063 of 

the African Union and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), related notably to food security 

et improvement of nutrition, promotion of sustainable agriculture discernible by production, 

productivity and greater value addition, youth employment, infrastructure, promotion of gender 

equality and empowerment of women as well as climate change. 

 

1.2. Justification of the Bank's involvement 
 

1.2.1  Agriculture financing remains insufficient as a result of reduction of external financing 

but also because the Government has not increased the proportion of national resources reserved 

for the agricultural sector. The share of the national budget reserved for agriculture was, on 

average, 5.2% between 2012 and 2014, compared to 10% of the national budget agreed upon 

during the Maputo declaration and the PNIA review conducted in 2015 showing a gap of 450 

billion BIF, which did not meet the target objective of inclusive growth, poverty reduction and 

strengthening of nutritional and food security. Considered in the past as the breadbasket of 

Burundi, Kirundo province, the project intervention zone is seriously affected by irregular 

rainfall patterns. As a result, it is one of the main emigration areas in the country. Climate 

analysis shows that the rainy season regularly experiences altered rainfall patterns and when 

this happens during the main farming seasons, the fall in agricultural production is considerable, 

increasing the rate of food insecurity which may be as high as 60%. On average, water deficit 

is estimated at more than 40%, which makes the choice offered by the development of swamps 

and hillside irrigation the best strategies to ensure a good harvest. In addition, due to a 

combination  of several factors such as (i) the sharp drop in agricultural production resulting 



 

2 

 

from climate change, (ii) the precariousness of populations, exacerbated by the widespread 

practice of selling of standing crops s causing a sharp drop in prices paid to producers, (iii) the 

high level of unemployment and underemployment, especially of the youth,  Kirundo province 

is among the poorest in the country with a  poverty index of 69.2% (ECVMB 2014) and a rate 

of malnutrition of children under 5 years, at more than 60%. In a context where 85 percent of 

the possesses land of less than or equal to 50 Ares and an average more than 6 children per 

household, efforts must be made to improve agricultural productivity, support the resilience the 

most vulnerable populations by allowing them to have access to employment and methods of 

financing income-generating activities. 

 

1.2.2  As a result of drought experienced in Kirundo Province in recent years which have had 

a negative impact on living conditions, the Government has implemented an ad hoc working 

group to propose a lasting solution to this situation. Within this context, the Bank was requested 

to support this program by financing PATAREB, for an amount of UA 12 million, to strengthen 

the resilience of the people of this region. This TSF support will help reduce the deficit in 

agricultural investment within the region, in particular by implementing the NIPA of the SAN. 

Consistent and high rates of agricultural growth resulting from high productivity are therefore 

necessary for increase in incomes and to accelerate poverty reduction. By targeting this 

disadvantaged area with significant agricultural potential, and by supporting  development of 

infrastructure and agricultural entrepreneurship, the TSF intervention will help reduce poverty, 

social disparities, promote employment of the youth, mitigate  fragility, and build resilience to 

climate change. In the project design, the prism of fragility has been applied so that the main 

sectoral fragility factors identified in the project implementation zone are taken into account by 

project activities, as indicated in annex IV. Finally, the project fits within the strategy of some 

agribusiness companies who have opted for the substitution of imported raw materials with 

local products, which will contribute to the improvement of the country’s trade balance.    

The Bank's intervention through this project is justified by the vision and objectives of the 

transformation strategy for agriculture "Feed Africa" which is part of the High 5s of the Bank. 
The project will indeed contribute to the objectives of the strategy "Feed Africa" by: (i) poverty 

reduction through the financing of investment in facilities, infrastructure and equipment likely to be 

valued for the generation of income by the beneficiaries; (ii) promoting the transformation of agricultural 

products by agricultural value (CVA) chains; and (iii) the promotion of export of agricultural products 

by market development and the implementation of systems of market information. It also integrates the 

priority of the Bank "Improving the lives of people in Africa" insofar as it will contribute to: (i) eradicate 

famine by high quality and high volume food production; (ii) safeguard basic income through 

employment created within the framework of development work and income generating activities 

initiated in particular by households living in extreme poverty. Finally, through activities in support 

of Youth entrepreneurship, the project will contribute to the implementation of the Bank’s 

strategy for Youth employment in Africa 2016-2025. At the national level, the project is aligned 

to the Bank’s Country Strategy Paper for Burundi (2012-2016) which has been extended to the 

end of 2017, mainly on the Pillar II: Improvement of the infrastructure that integrates related 
activities oriented toward the fight against vulnerability and exclusion of vulnerable groups with the aim 

to contribute to mitigate the factors of fragility. Specifically, the project will contribute to results 4 to 7 

of Pillar 2 namely: (i) contribution to the promotion of food security (ii) protection of the environment 

and sustainable management of soil and water, (iii) creation of jobs and (iv) adaptation to climate 

change. 

1.3. Aid Coordination 
 

1.3.1  The framework for aid coordination is based on the institutional mechanism of follow-

up and evaluation of the LRCS2, articulated around the sectoral groups, which are frameworks 

for synergies and cooperation. Despite suspension of aid by some donors, the  "agricultural and 



 

3 

 

rural development" and "social protection” sectoral groups have remained operational. The 

Bank actively participates in arrangement of consultations and dialogue which brings together 

non-governmental organizations involved in these sectors. The meetings are organised on a 

quarterly basis to facilitate discussions on subjects relating to policies, and to conduct, in a 

concerted manner, discussions relating to planning and programming of various projects and to 

ensuring regular monitoring of  activities in the different sectors. This coordination mechanism 

allows improvement of complementarity of interventions by different PTFs, thus creating a 

natural synergy to multiply the impact of projects on the economic and social development of 

Burundi. 

 

1.3.2  In the agricultural sector, the Bank financed the Bugesera natural region rural 

infrastructure support project which wrapped up its activities in 2016. The other donors 

involved in this sector are the World Bank, IFAD, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and 

Belgium. In the field of social protection, the Bank has financed capacity-building projects in 

the past few years which have allowed the setting up of institutional structures in charge of 

employment and social protection while at the same time supporting a project for strengthening 

entrepreneurial capabilities of the youth and women. The main stakeholders in the social 

protection sector are the World Bank, WFP and UNICEF. With respect to youth employment, 

the only active project is the one financed by IFAD. The table below presents the main amounts 

by sources of funding currently active in the agricultural sector in Burundi. The table below

1.3.3  Burundi and its partners have made progress in terms of aid efficiency, particularly in 
predictability of aid and its inclusion in the budget. Efforts are still to be made with regard to 
incorporation of gender equality into the development plans and in the use of national public 
finance management systems and procurement. In Burundi, the use of national public 
procurement systems by the Bank in its operations remains rather limited. However, since 2013, 
it has begun to use the national procedures for the award of contracts in the framework of the 
national tenders (AON) on a pilot basis. The on-going revision of the Code of Public 
Procurement (CPP) and Standard Bidding Documents for National Tenders (DTAON), which 
benefits from the Bank’s assistance, the World Bank and the Belgian Technical Cooperation, 
will allow the systematic recourse to the national procurement system. In terms of alignment to 
national systems and procedures, all projects are managed directly by permanent structures, 
within the supervising ministries. With regard to capacity building, the Bank works closely with 



 

4 

 

the Government, in organizing training in key areas such as financial management, 
disbursements and procurement with a view to the efficient and effective implementation of the 
portfolio by the CEP.

2.2 Adopted technical solutions and substitution solutions studied  
 

2.2.1  The technical solutions adopted are based on the lessons learned from similar 

achievements, including the PAIRB and the PABVARC, adapted to the specific context of the 

area of intervention of the project.  Thus the choice of gravity irrigation which involves watering 

the crops by dripping water through open conduits connected to a reservoir upstream which 

could be either a dam with a water pipe from the river or a water container has been preferred 

for Nyavyamo and Kabuyenge swamps..  This technical choice was motivated by the fact that 

the cost of construction of a gravity irrigation system is 3 to 4 times lower than that of a 

pressurised one and does not require a source of energy 

 

2.2.2  Regarding hillside irrigation, the chose option was photovoltaic energy on the basis of 

the following benefits: (i) solar energy is inexhaustible and non-polluting (clean and does not 

emit greenhouse gases); (ii) it supplies energy needs in a sustainable manner and with 

significant savings; (iii) the costs of maintenance and operation of a thermal installation are 

relatively low; (iv) the energy performance is positive once configuration has been carried out 

in relation with the irrigation needs. 

 

2.2.3  The choice of the "Cash for Work” approach  has been prioritized with regard to support 

to social safety nets, in order to meet both the needs of protection of watersheds and access to 

income for the most vulnerable households. In addition, the transfer of agricultural inputs and 

support for income-generating activities naturally helps these households to emerge from 

vulnerability in a sustainable way. 
 

Table 2.2: Alternative solutions considered and reasons for rejection 
Alternative solution Brief Description Reason for rejection 

Pressurised irrigation 

system, with an efficiency 

that can reach 80% to 90% 

of irrigation system 

In addition to irrigation system 

install a pumping system to 

distribute water in the reservoirs. 

This option is outside the project framework  which requires 

involvement of individuals and local cooperatives in the 

implementation of hydro-agricultural developments to be 

installed at a community level. In addition, this solution is too 

expensive for all communities 

Pressurised irrigation using 

thermal energy (diesel or 

petrol) 

Pressurised irrigation using a 

pumping station operated by a fossil 

fuel energy source (diesel or petrol) 

This option is considered too expensive, because of the cost 

of fuel. The source of energy is not aligned with the 

framework, in compliance with environmental standards  

Recruit a private provider 

to perform all of watershed 

development works. 

A service provider is recruited to 

complete the watershed 

development works for the benefit 

of inhabitants. 

This option does not allow the service provider company to 

use the local labour force which will then access income 

benefits intended for the most vulnerable households. 

 

2.3 Type of Project 
 

PATAREB is an investment operation financed by a Pillar I grant from the Transition 

Support Fund. Burundi does not implement project and programs using the sectoral approach 



 

6 

 

due to institutional constraints. Consequently, the project approach has been considered more 

axed towards the framework of this proposal, to guarantee achievement of results and ensure 

effectiveness and efficiency in the use of resources allocated to the project.  

 

2.4 Cost of project and financing arrangements 
 

2.4.1  Cost of project. The total cost of the project is estimated at UA 12.00 million (BIF 

29.28 billion) excluding taxes and duties. This cost is distributed as follows:  UA 5.76 million 

(BIF 14.06 billion) in foreign currency and UA 6.24 million (BIF 15.23 billion) in local 

currency. This costs includes contingency reserves and for increase in costs which are estimated 

to be at 5% and 4% respectively on average. The provision for an increase in prices has been 

estimated on the basis of  current levels and projected from rates of inflation  in local currency 

and in foreign currencies at 3.2% and 1.8% respectively , per year on average. The provision 

for physical contingencies is estimated at between 0 and 7 %, a summary of the estimated cost 

of the project by component and by expenditure account is presented in Tables 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 

below, while the details are provided in the technical annex of project appraisal report.

2.4.2 Financing facility: The costs shall be entirely financed by a TSF grant amounting to 

UA 12 million.  Counterpart contributions by the government were not feasible for this project, 

given that Burundi is recovering progressively but with major challenges from the 2015 socio-

political crisis, hardly mobilising contributions for recent and on-going operations.  This 

situation gave the Country-Team no other choice but to recommend a financial arrangement 

without counterpart state funds, if at all feasible. Within this context, the project was designed 

to allow financing of all activities from TSF resources. Distribution of financing of expenses 

by source of funds and list of goods and services is recorded in tables 2.6 and 2.7, here below.

2.5 Area and beneficiaries targeted by the project 
 

2.5.1  The project intervention zone (PIZ) covers the natural region of Bugesera extending 

over all the seven communes of Kirundo Province and the Gitreranyi Commune of Muyinga 

Province.  It is bordered to the North and the West by the Republic of Rwanda and Ngozi 

Province. To the South and East, it shares a common border with Muyinga Province. Its surface 

area of 2,100 km2 represents 75% of the national territory. The population of the Province in 

2017 is estimated at 1,004,907 inhabitants, of whom 519,665 are women. Despite having a high 

agricultural potential, the region’s agricultural yields are low not only because of the limited 

use of chemical fertilisers, but also the rudimentary farming techniques, lack of inputs, 

degeneration of seeds, etc. the dominant cultivation system is the combination of crops with the 

exception of rice cultivation, which is carried out in monoculture in swamps.  

 

2.5.2   The project will directly benefit a population of 900,000 people (51% women) 

composed mainly of agri-pastoralists. The latter will be supported through activities aimed at 

developing rice, maize and sorghum value chains and supporting the development of the blue 

economy. The development of these value chains will also benefit private sector companies 

engaged in the processing of agricultural products. In addition, special attention will be paid to 

vulnerable populations as well as the youth. Vulnerable populations will benefit particularly 

from the “Cash-for-work” approach developed through watershed management, transfer of 

agricultural inputs and support for the development of income-generating activities. This 

population group will benefit from 20% of parcels that will be developed in the Nyavyamo 

swamp. The project will also prioritise youth through related activities related to 

entrepreneurship promotion to enable self-employment. The choice of beneficiaries will be 

made in close consultation with the populations and the local Administration.  

 

2.6 Participatory approach for the identification, design and implementation of the 
project 
 

The Bank has adopted the participatory approach in its assistance to Burundi to 

formulate the request for TSF financing and throughout the project preparation process. This 

has resulted in the organisation of workshops and discussion meetings with public institutions, 

non-state actors, producer organizations, civil society including organizations working in the 

field of gender, private sector, TFPs and beneficiaries. This approach made it possible to better 

understand the major issues, to identify the appropriate solutions, and to reach a broad 

consensus on its design and the implementation modalities of the project. Thus, the producers 

reaffirmed the need to take into account the current rights holders in the allocation of developed 

swamp parcels. Rural women in the PIZ emphasised their access to developed perimeters, and 

new processing and marketing technologies. The Kirundo Governor and Local Authorities 

expressed their specific needs to address the vulnerability of inhabitants, by supporting social 

safety nets, improving agricultural production conditions and mitigating conflicts related to 

land competition. As for the youth, they insisted on vocational training and their successful 



 

9 

 

establishment as modern agricultural entrepreneurs targeting the markets. The project will 

continue this participatory approach so that local actors take ownership of activities and 

implementation during implementation. Good communication will be developed to ensure 

visibility of achievements and impacts and wide dissemination of project achievements. 
 

2.7 Consideration of Bank Group experience and lessons learned in project design 
 

2.7.1  In October 2017, the Bank's portfolio in Burundi consisted of 17 operations, of which 8 

were national, at a total amount of UA 121.4 million (USD 171.2 million). The agricultural 

sector does not have an active project, the only project in the sector having closed on 

31/12/2016. The overall performance of the portfolio is assessed as satisfactory with a rating of 

3.5 in scale from 1 to 4.  The portfolio review conducted in 2016 highlighted shortcomings that 

were taken into account to ensure the project's performance. These include:  (i) Lack of 

familiarity with the Bank's procurement and internal control rules and procedures within the 

PIUs delays in setting up key project staff; (ii) delay in setting up key personnel, (iii) delay in 

the development of technical studies and poor synchronization of input procurement and  

weather patterns, (iv) low ownership of project achievements by beneficiary organizations; (v) 

delay in the provision and / or insufficiency of counterpart funds which severely hampers the 

implementation of the Bank’s projects. In addition, the project took into account lessons learned 

from the Bank's Strategy and Program Appraisal Report for Burundi 2004-2015, which focused 

on (i) insufficient targeting to ensure that vulnerable populations are taken into account in the 

various projects as well as (ii) a weak integration of job creation support activities, especially 

for the youth and environmental conservation. 

 

2.7.2  The design of PATAREB took into account the lessons learned from the Bank’s projects 

in Burundi and those of the Bank's TSF portfolio, as shown below: 

 

Table 2.8:  
Consideration of the Bank Group experience and lessons learned 

Key lessons and experiences  Actions taken in the PATAREB design 

Lack of familiarity with the Bank's 

procurement and internal control rules 

and procedures within the PIUs. 

Provide proper training in Bank procurement and financial management 

procedures at project launch to PIU members and executives from partner 

administrative structures involved in project management. 

Delay in setting up key project staff. Adoption of the pre-procurement process in order to quickly set up the 

PIU and launch the various procurement processes.  

 
Delays in the development of technical 

studies.  

 

Low synchronisation of agricultural 

input acquisition and the rhythm of the 

seasons. 

The project will adopt community procurement for agricultural input 

acquisitions to ensure compliance with growing seasons. 

 

Low ownership of project achievements 

by beneficiary organisations. 

Right from the start of the project; recruit a local operator (NGO) with 

the necessary expertise to: (i) structure and strengthen the organisational 

capacities of producer organisations, (ii) provide support for improving 

good governance of POs, and (iii) support development of agricultural 

production. 

  

Late and/or insufficient provisions of 

counterpart funds severely handicap the 

implementation of the Bank’s projects. 

Limited use of counterpart funds to finance key activities to address 

current fiscal challenges. 

 

Insufficient targeting of vulnerable 

populations. 

The NGO providing support from the beginning of the project will 

support the process of targeting vulnerable households.  



 

10 

 

Key lessons and experiences  Actions taken in the PATAREB design 

 Some fragility factors such as 

environmental protection, employment, 

especially of youth are not sufficiently 

taken into account in Bank operations in 

Burundi. 

A sub-component has been set aside to support the creation of youth 

employment and the protection of the environment will be taken into 

account in watershed management and reforestation.  

 

2.8 Key performance indicators  
 

The main performance indicators to be monitored from the baseline are:  (i) number of 

rehabilitated dams; (ii) developed areas with partial and total control; (iii) level of additional 

production (tonnes) and crop yields (t/ha); (iv) number of VA infrastructure completed (market 

sheds, km of farm tracks, warehouses for products and inputs, etc.); (v) number of operators by 

type of development supported disaggregated by gender; (vi) number of technology reviews 

and multi-stakeholder platforms completed and the percentage attributed to women; (vii) level 

of income growth including that of women and youth; (viii) number of youth jobs and women 

created in entrepreneurial initiatives; (ix) number of producers, processors and traders trained 

and organized into cooperatives in accordance; (x) degree of involvement of women in 

decision-making bodies and their rate of access to land after development; (xi) number of 

installed transformation units; and (xii) malnutrition rate in the beneficiary population. All the 

indicators selected for the project have been aligned with the main CSP indicators and those 

retained within the framework of the NAIP.  

 

III. Project feasibility 
 

3.1 Economic and financial performance  
 

3.1.1  The financial and economic analysis of the project was carried on the basis of 

cost/benefit analysis of the expected outcomes of the project, comparing the with and without 

project situations, over the life cycle of investments in promotion of agricultural transformation 

or project's lifespan  (Project life), estimated at 25 years. The expected benefits of the project 

come from the transformation of agriculture into the project intervention zone (PIZ), based on 

the preservation of natural resources and other livelihoods, including: (i) the sustainable 

promotion of agricultural value chains by intelligent agriculture, for productions in the project 

area such as rice, sorghum, maize, cassava, beans and farm produce. (ii) promotion of the blue 

economy (pond culture, cage and above-ground bins); (i) sustainable promotion of value chains 

of non-timber forest products (NTFPs), such as honey (beekeeping), pods, almonds, seeds and 

natural fruit, leaves and bark used in the traditional pharmacopoeia; (iv) improving the 

ecological balance and maintaining a habitat conducive to wildlife development that also offers 

environmental opportunities; (v) improving the well-being of the population by preventing 

drought and famine, improving food security, reducing the medical bill with the regulation of 

climatic conditions, reducing the hardship of the population; the work of families, especially 

women and vulnerable groups, improving people's life expectancy, better incomes for access 

to health care and education, etc. (vi) improvement of animal and livestock production, because 

of the quality and abundance of pasture and water; (vii) spin-offs from carbon dioxide 

sequestration (carbon credit, including bio-carbon); and (viii) the creation of temporary and 

permanent jobs, resulting from project achievements. The detailed assumptions of the economic 

and financial analysis, the tables of production and exploitation models (situation without and 

with the project) and the financial and economic flows are detailed in the technical annexes 

(Annex B8).

TRI (baseline scenario) 20.17% 

Economic NPV (baseline scenario) 92.01 billion BIF 

TRE (baseline scenario) 23.02% 

 

3.1.2  Financial performance: The additional revenues resulting from the various models of 

development and exploitation retained are the following: (i) development of marshes 

(floodplains with water control) allows double rice cultivation (10 T/ha in total per year), 

corresponding to about BIF 1 509 000/ha, or BIF377 000  per farmer with 51 % of women 

beneficiaries; (ii) facilities also used for market gardening in rotation, for a production value 

BIF 7,474,000/ha or BIF 1,868,500 per male farmer, including women beneficiaries; (iii) 

cultivation of sorghum and maize in family farming on plateaux and watersheds BIF990 000 

/ha per farmer; (iv) the development of fish farming on and around Cohoha and Rweru lakes, 

for an estimated annual income per farmer of BIF845,000  (see Annex B7 for the typology of 

farm size and overall additional revenues released, thus contributing to increased value added 

through the project). The internal financial rate of return (IRR) is estimated at BIF 89.72 billion. 

The sensitivity tests established on the basis of simulations of successive decreases in prices or 

agricultural yields from 2.5% to 35%, show that the IRR falls more slowly than prices and 

yields, with a break-even value that is set at a drastic price reduction of more than 27.25%. As 

a result, the IRR is stable, with the effect of reducing the incidence of poverty in the IPA. 

 

3.1.3  Economic performance: The basic economic rate of return is 23.01% for a net present 

value (NPV) of BIF 92.01 billion. The other economic impacts of the project can be 

summarized as follows: (i) the upstream effects of additional revenues on providers (NGOs, 

companies, suppliers, consulting firms); (ii) the downstream effects of generating additional 

income on traders and processors who are predominantly women, thus contributing to women's 

empowerment and economic empowerment; (iii) lowering foreign exchange costs by 

significantly reducing the import bill for rice in the country's trade balance and currency 

balance; (iv) the impact on wealth creation in the country through the increase in GDP induced 

by the generation of additional value added. For households, the benefits of the project will 

result, inter alia, in better nutrition for vulnerable groups (children, women of childbearing age 

and the elderly), a reduction in the medical bill, the arduous task of agricultural workers, 

particularly women, reducing the incidence of monetary and non-monetary poverty, enhancing 

livelihoods and household resilience to food insecurity and the effects of climate change, and 

in the long run, increase in life expectancy and improvement of the human development index. 
 

3.1.4  The results of the financial and economic analysis show that PATAREB is financially 

and economically viable.  
 

3.1.5  Sensitivity Analysis: The sensitivity analysis was carried out on the basis of scenario 

analysis to simulate the financial performance indicators (NPV, IRR and A/C Ratio) from the 

most sensitive endogenous variables of the analysis model used, namely the price and output 

of the productions. The simulations thus carried out show that, as the prices of products fall , 

the financial performance indicators also drop, but much more slowly. On the basis of this 

result, it can be concluded that the financial performance of PATAREB can be considered as 

stable, although the project's financial results are sensitive to lower prices. In addition, the 

switch-over threshold linked to the price decrease is over -27.5%. Therefore, prices need to fall 

drastically by more than 27.5% for the internal rate of return (IRR) to be equal to the opportunity 



 

12 

 

cost of Capital estimated at 12%. The successive decline in yields is also reflected in a drop in 

the values of the financial performance indicators (IRR, NPV, A/C ratio), as in the previous 

situation with the fall in prices. Similarly, the break-even point of return is -27.88% decline in 

yield. The scenario synthesis is presented in Annex B8, as indicated above. 
 

3.2 Environmental and social impact 
 

3.2.1  PATAREB is a follow-up to the Bugesera Natural Region Rural Infrastructure Support 

Project (PAIRB), which focused on major developments.  The activities planned during this 

second phase of the Project will complement those that were not completed during the first 

phase and will focus on improving value chains, social safety nets and youth entrepreneurship. 

The project is classified in Category 2. In line with Bank procedures, the summary of the ESMP 

was posted at least one month ahead of expected Board consideration. 

 

3.2.2  The planned activities will be mainly carried out in rural areas, outside the dwellings, 

on agrosilvopastal areas. They are not likely to generate negative impacts or major risks, or lead 

to significant asset losses or population displacements. These impacts and effects will be of 

minor magnitude and could be mitigated by application of different mitigation measures and 

good practices. The negative impacts will be small, and will be mainly related to the generation 

of waste, the risks of pollution, the risk of accidents and gas emissions during the realisation of 

certain developments. 

  

3.2.3  An Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) has been developed in line 

with the Bank's environmental and social policies and guidelines, and in accordance with 

Burundi's regulatory framework in the field. The ESMP recommended different measures, 

mitigation and enhancement, but also provisions to be made during the implementation of the 

project, as well as the costs associated with these different measures. 

 

3.2.4  An Ordinance of the Minister in charge of the environment had set up a Technical 

Committee in charge of the implementation of the ESMP of Phase I of the project. This 

Committee could be renewed taking into account the new sub-components (social safety nets 

and youth entrepreneurship), and by integrating the provincial and municipal structures 

responsible for the environment, social development, gender, youth, etc. During the 

implementation of the project, the Project Management Unit (PMU) will be responsible for 

coordinating the activities of the Environmental Monitoring Committee and providing them 

with administrative, technical and financial support; etc. 
 

3.2.5  Climate change: CO2 emissions per capita (metric tons) in Burundi are estimated at 

0.03 tons (2013), compared with 1.1 in Africa and 3.0 in developing countries. Burundi is also 

experiencing a significant reduction in ODS (ozone depleting substances) consumption, from 

26.76 tonnes weighted in the 2000-2004 period to 7.0 tonnes in 2015. However, there is a sharp 

decline in forest area on the national territory. From 11.3% in 1990, it represented only 6.7% 

in 2010, and fell to a proportion of just 5.5% in 2015. The current rate is 64.54 square kilometres 

of annual loss of the area covered by forests, or more than 2% of annual average. 

 

3.2.6  In relation to climate change, the project area is mainly confronted with recurring 

droughts, sometimes alternated by periods of heavy rains that have led to swamps flooding, 

lake level rise, siltation some lowlands, soil erosion, etc. These natural phenomena negatively 

impact ecosystems, production systems and food security. In this context, the activities planned 

by the project will to a large extent enhance the resilience of ecosystems and communities to 

climate change, through the implementation of a series of actions that will contribute to the 



 

13 

 

improvement of the production systems , the reduction of the practice of the extensive system, 

the restoration of ecosystems through the application of good agricultural practices, 

reforestation actions, the establishment of green belts, bank protection activities, etc.  

 

3.2.7  The project activities align with the options and priority activities identified in Burundi's 

National Action Program for Adaptation to Climate Change (NAPA). The project should 

benefit from the "SAP-Burundi" project (early warning system) to integrate climate information 

into the agricultural calendar, the management of works, etc. As part of the National Program 

of Reforestation, Burundi is committed to increase carbon dioxide sinks by reforestation of 

4,000 hectares per year for 15 years from 2016. The PATAFI, which has planned a major 

reforestation program and the establishment of green belts, etc., will contribute to achieving the 

set objective.  
 

3.2.8 Gender: Women (about 52%) and youth (average age of the provincial population, 20.5 
years and median age, 16.0 years) represent a large majority of the population in the project 

area. Despite the existence of large hydro agricultural resources and potential, the population 

of the project area is among the poorest in the country (76% on a national average of 64%). 

Farming and farming systems are still traditional and weakly intensified.  

 

3.2.9 The consultations revealed that the agricultural sector, in which a large majority of 
women are involved, faces the following main constraints: very high pressure on land and 

fragmentation of agricultural parcels (average 0.5 ha); difficulties for producers and especially 

for women to access land and inputs; work overload due to household chores, strong 

responsibility for child rearing, household operation and management; weak management and 

programs on improving and diversifying production systems, leadership and entrepreneurship; 

difficulties related to the conservation, the processing and the sale of the products, etc.  

 

3.2.10 Despite the efforts made, there is still inequality and discrimination against women in 
terms of equitable access to land and other factors of production; and decision-making bodies. 

 

3.2.11 The PATAREB, whose main activities target women, in particular, will contribute to 
improving their access to factors of production such as credit and land, conservation, 

processing, production flow, etc. The project will thus make a significant contribution to 

improving women's living conditions by improving agricultural production systems and 

sectors, increasing production and income, and strengthening their capacity; etc.  

 

3.2.12 The consultations also revealed that they spend most of their income on the family, 
especially children. Increasing women's incomes will help improve household food security 

and well-being. The project will ensure that women and women benefit equally from other 

project benefits. 

 

3.2.13 The Ministry of National Solidarity, Human Rights and Gender (MSNDPHG) is in 
charge of the promotion of women and gender equality. To carry out its mission, the 

MSNDPHG includes within it a Directorate General for the Promotion of Women and Gender 

Equality, structured in two departments: the Department for the Promotion of Women and the 

Department of Gender Equality. The Ministry also relies on deconcentrated structures called 

Family Development Centers (FDC), which are located at the level of each Province. The latter 

are relays of the ministry to communities on all aspects related to gender and other missions. 

 



 

14 

 

3.2.14  Provincial and municipal bodies and structures dealing with gender issues will have to 
be integrated into the bodies responsible for project management (technical committee, 

monitoring committee, etc.). Gender-related indicators will be taken into account in the project's 

monitoring and evaluation system based on disaggregated data by sex, etc. 

 

3.2.15 Social: With 84.7% for Muyinga and 76.2% for Kirundo respectively, the provinces in 
the area of influence of the project had poverty rates well above the national average (64%). In 

terms of nutrition, the province of Kirundo has a global acute malnutrition rate of 5%, that of 

chronic malnutrition at47.9% which is above the critical threshold of 40% set by WHO. 

 

3.2.16 In such a context of poverty and vulnerability, by improving agricultural production 
systems and the development of value chains, the positive impacts and effects of the project 

will be considerable on local and even national development in different sectors, activities and 

on all social categories (adults, youth, women, etc.). The project will contribute to improving 

agricultural production and incomes, enhance food security, foster the creation of local 

employment opportunities, contribute to poverty reduction and the vulnerability of targeted 

populations, reduce unemployment and youth migration, contribute to the empowerment of 

women, etc.  

 

3.2.17 However, the works could generate nuisances and inconveniences (noise, dust, exhaust 
gases, etc.) that could affect the health (respiratory diseases) of the workers and the populations 

who would be exposed to it. The mixing of populations in the work areas can also contribute to 

the proliferation of sexually transmitted diseases (STI/HIV AIDS). Rigorous safety, awareness 

and good practice measures are advocated to minimize and reduce these risks.  
 

3.2.18 Youth employment and promotion of agricultural entrepreneurship: This 
component will help develop the entrepreneurial culture of young project leaders to increase 

incomes and create decent jobs for youth and women. The project will assist the emergence of 

small clusters of young promoters and will directly reach 1,200 young girls and boys trained in 

agricultural entrepreneurship, and installed in all links of the value chain: production activities 

in developed marshes, farms fish farming, processing, trade and services. This initiative aims 

ultimately, by its multiplier effect to reach nearly 3,600 young men and women.  

 

3.2.19 To this end, the project will work in partnership with the Kirundo Trade Centres (CEM 
Kirundo) and the Mutwenzi Centre in the identification, selection and training of beneficiaries.  

These institutions will receive project support, and will work with the Microfinance Institutions 

(MFIs) present in the project area for the financing needed for business development. Thus, the 

supervision of young promoters will be done in the incubation Centres, mentioned above, also 

responsible for mobilising aggregators and private operators. They will help youth to make their 

credit reports more reliable in order to better access the available financial resources. The 

project will also facilitate youth's access to developed perimeters and equipment in the form of 

basic kits, according to their business plans and areas of specialisation. Finally, the project will 

promote partnerships between all actors for better integration of value chains (production, 

processing, inputs, markets, etc.). The operational modalities of agricultural entrepreneurship 

and financial incentives will be defined following a specific study at the start of the project. 

 

3.2.20 Forced relocation: The activities of PATAREB do not induce any displacement of 
populations nor their resettlement. They contribute to the development of the affected territories 

and to maintain the populations in their zones

IV. Implementation  
 

4.1 Provisions for implementation: 
 

4.1.1 Implementing rules: In line with the Presidential Directives N°02/2015, the Country 
should take all necessary steps to fast-track the start-up of the project. The Ministry of 

Agriculture and Livestock (MINAGRIE) will be in charge of the project management and 

coordination.  A multi-sector project steering committee (PSC) will also be established to 

ensure guidance and orientation of the project implementation, as required. As part of the 

coordination of project activities, MINAGRIE will be supported by a full-time Project 

Management Unit (PMU), under the supervision of the Kirundo Provincial Directorate of 

Agriculture and Livestock, which has its headquarters in Kirundo. The PAIRB Administrative, 

Financial and Accounting Procedures Manual will need to be adapted to affirm the enhanced 

role of DPAE in the management of PATAREB. 

 

4.1.2 The PMU will be mainly in charge of the coordination, monitoring and evaluation of 
project activities. It will be composed as follows: (i) a Project Coordinator; (ii) an Internal 

Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist; (iii) an Irrigation Engineer; (iv) a Procurement 

Specialist; (v) an Agronomist; (vi) a youth entrepreneurship specialist, (vii) a socio-economist, 

(vii) an administrative and financial manager; and (viii) an accountant. In addition, there needs 

to be an option for using MINAGRIE's internal expertise for positions whose capacities exist 

within. In accordance with the results of the consultations of the preparation and evaluation 

missions, these positions are those of the Coordinator and the Monitoring and Evaluation 

Specialist. For each of the two positions, three CVs will be submitted to the Bank, which will 

validate the evaluation report of the proposals made by the Ministry. The use of the expertise 

of the previous project was also retained. Thus, the Rural Engineering Expert should be 

reappointed if he is still available to fill this position. This proposal is justified by the fact that 

development and infrastructure development play a significant role in PATAREB. For all other 

positions, recruitment will be done through a call for applications. 

 

4.1.3 The project will also have support staff recruited as needed. In Bujumbura, the PMU 
will be supported by a Project Antenna responsible for liaising with the Home Ministry and the 

technical partners of the project and central services of the Administration to carry out activities 

requiring coordination with these Organisations. The PMU will also be supported by one-off 

technical assistance. 

 

 

4.1.4 Value chain development activities will be carried out under agreements to be signed 
with IRRI for the rice value chain and ISABU for the maize, sorghum and food value chains, 

respectively.  

 

4.1.5 In order to deal with the problems of agricultural financing in the project area, a 
Guarantee Fund will be established and an agreement signed with UCODE and an MFI with 

satisfactory capacities and of which more than 70% of the credits distributed go to the 

agricultural sector to enable beneficiaries to have easy access to credit.   

 

4.1.6 Procurement: All purchases of goods (including non-consulting services), of works 
and consultancy services, financed by the Bank under the project, will be made in accordance 

with the “Procurement Policy for Funded Operations by the Bank Group” as of October 2015 

and in accordance with the provisions set out in the Financing Agreement. More specifically, 



 

16 

 

procurement will be carried out according to the Bank's Procurement Methods and Procedures 

(MPA) based on the relevant standard tender documents (DSAO) for all markets.    

 

4.1.7 Procurement Risk and Capacity Assessment (ERCA): The risk assessment at the 
country, sector and project levels as well as the acquisition capability of the Executing Agency 

(EA) for the project was conducted and the results were used to guide the decision of the choice 

of the procurement system (Borrower, Bank, or Third Party) used for specific activities or a set 

of similar activities in the project. In addition, a market analysis was conducted with a view to 

obtaining information on market characteristics, the factors that may affect competition and the 

main players in the sectoral markets. The results of the evaluations and market analysis notably 

made it possible to carry out procurement planning, market structuring, the choice of the best 

procurement methods and procedures (MPA) adapted to the desired objective, and the 

establishment of the review and supervision framework by the Bank.  

 

4.1.8 Appropriate risk mitigation measures were included in the Procurement Risk and 
Capacity Assessment Action Plan (PERCA) as outlined in Section B.7.9. of Annex B7.    
 

4.1.9 Financial management: The Project Management Unit (PMU) will be responsible for 
the overall coordination and financial management of the project. Its financial management 

staff will include the Project Coordinator, the Administrative and Financial Officer, the 

Accountant and the Cashier, all recruited in accordance with the procurement provisions of the 

project.  
 

4.1.10 The financial management systems of the PAIRB Management Unit whose structures 
will be used under the PATAREB framework are not generally satisfactory and the overall 

fiduciary risk is substantial due to the absence of: (i) a Coordinator and the financial staff 

indicated above; (ii) an administrative, financial and accounting procedures manual; (iii) an 

operational computerized accounting and financial management software; and (iv) financial 

management tools and terms of reference.  
 

4.1.11 Consequently, the PMU must make the following arrangements: (i) Establish, as soon 
as the Project is launched, a budget plan coupled with the provisional calendar of activities; (ii) 

recruit, from the start of the Project, a consultant responsible for drawing up the Administrative, 

Financial and Accounting Procedures Manual (MPCF), and another consultant responsible for 

setting up the computerized accounting and financial management system (CCIS); (iii) allocate 

financial tasks as soon as financial staff are recruited; (iv) put in place the financial management 

framework and instruments (see Annex B 6 of Volume II). 
 

4.1.12 Disbursements: The disbursement methods to be used to mobilize the financing of the 
TSF Grant are: (i) the direct payment method; (ii) the special account / working capital method 

and (iii) the repayment method. Direct payments will be made in accordance with work 

contracts, goods and services signed between the recipient and the suppliers in accordance with 

the Bank's procurement rules and procedures and the national procurement legislation. The 

special account method will be used for the payment of operating expenses, training costs, field 

mission expenses, and so on. This will result in the opening of a Special Account at the Central 

Bank of Burundi, which in turn will, for all the funds received from the TSF, supply the bank 

account of the CGP opened in a bank acceptable to the AfDB. The repayment method will be 

used when eligible expenditures on the resources of the TSF Grants have been pre-financed 

with the prior approval of the Bank. These disbursements will be done in accordance with the 

list of goods and services and the Bank's rules and procedures as described in the disbursement 

manual. The disbursements modalities are detailed in the technical annexes. 



 

17 

 

 

4.1.13 Audits: An independent and competent external audit firm will audit the reliability of 
the consolidated annual financial statements prepared by the CGP once a year and assess the 

functioning of the internal control system for the entire project. He will be recruited according 

to the terms of reference and the competitive bidding procedures recommended by the Bank. 

The audit costs will be financed by the TSFGrants. Audit reports must be sent to the Bank every 

year, no later than 6 months after the end of the audited financial year. Audits will be conducted 

in accordance with IFAC's International ISA Auditing Standards and the Bank's comprehensive 

terms of reference, which will be communicated to the project. 

 

4.2 Monitoring 
 

4.2.1  Monitoring mechanisms: A Project Steering Committee (PSC) will be set up. It is 

chaired by the Minister of Agriculture and Livestock or his representative, and composed of a 

representative of the Ministry of Finance, the Permanent Executive Secretariat of the National 

Commission for Social Protection, the Governor of Kirundo, the DPAE, two (02) Beneficiary 

Representatives, a Private Sector Representative and a Civil Society Representative.  The PSC 

will meet at least twice a year in regular sessions to approve the budget and validate the results 

of the project performance. The PSC Secretariat shall be provided by the DGPAE. The 

responsibilities of the PSC shall be as follows: (i) major guidelines based on the coherence 

between the strategic framework and the execution of the project; (ii) ensuring that the results 

and recommendations of the external evaluation reports are taken into account in the execution 

of the project; (iii) directives to the PMU for the eventual reorientation of the Project; (iv) 

approval of the project's annual work program and budget (AWPB) prior to submission to the 

Bank's no-objection notice; and (v) guaranteeing project development objectives. 

 

4.2.2 Internal monitoring and evaluation will be carried out by the Project Monitoring and 

Evaluation Unit, while external monitoring and evaluation will be provided by the DGPAE and 

the Ministry in charge of Finance. The external monitoring and evaluation is to measure the 

effectiveness and efficiency of outputs (products) of the project and their contributions to the 

achievement of development results that are the effects and impacts of the project. This be 

ensured with the involvement of other stakeholders, in addition to the two annual supervision 

missions organized by the Bank. The mid-term review will be conducted in the 3rd year. At the 

end of the project, the Bank and the Government will produce a completion report in due time. 

The main stages of implementation are summarized below.

4.3 Governance 
 

4.3.1 In the area of economic and financial governance, Burundi has achieved encouraging 

results since the 2015 crisis, initiating a number of structural reforms in public financial 

management, and the mitigation of fiduciary risks. However, improvements are needed for 

domestic resource mobilization, programming and allocation of public resources. Although 

there has been progress in bringing the public procurement system up to standard, slowness in 

the procurement system is still one of the major shortcomings in project implementation. At the 

project level, risks related to fiduciary issues will be mitigated, including the use of a public 

financial management system and the strengthening of the PMU's procurement and financial 

management capacity. 

 

4.3.2 With regard to land, the dualism of modern and customary rights is a major handicap in 

promoting investments in agriculture in Burundi and to local peace. PATAREB will improve 

land governance by providing support for land planning and management, as well as 

strengthening municipalities' capacity to manage them. Tripartite agreements will be 

established between land claimants, municipalities and professional organizations, and 

collective agreements will mitigate conflicts.  
 

4.4 Durability 
 

4.4.1  The project is based on a participatory approach for better ownership of activities. Rural 

communities, local authorities and decentralized technical services have indeed been involved 

in the design of the project, and therefore will participate in all the developments they benefit 

from and will be reinforced to prevent and manage conflict linked to resource exploitation. 

They will bring their own knowledge and perceptions on the phenomena of climate change.  

 

4.4.2  The sustainability of the program is also based on the participation of the beneficiaries 

in the project. The PMU will work in collaboration with these organizations to ensure land 

tenure security, strengthen the capacities of farmers' organizations (OPs) for the technical and 

financial management of infrastructure, and initiate sustainable mechanisms for the recovery of 

infrastructure maintenance and renewal costs. Watershed protection activities will be carried 

out as part of the social safety nets. Support for para-agricultural trades (mechanization, 

maintenance, advisory support, etc.) will also help to ensure the long-term provision of services 

necessary for the viability of the activities undertaken. The simplicity of the planned 

infrastructure and the capacity building of the beneficiaries favour the sustainability of the 

investments. In particular, their realization will take into account the reliable climatic 

information collected. 
 

4.4.3  The use of the “value chain” approach with the consideration of aspects of processing, 

storage and marketing of products will make it possible to link production to markets more. 

Thus, the creation of small processing units of economically, financially and technically viable 

products will be a guarantee of the sustainability of the achievements of the project. The project 

will ensure the development of gender sensitive infrastructures and technologies to promote the 

sustainable economic empowerment of vulnerable people (women and youth) and the 

diversification of their sources of income. Sustainability of project interventions will also be 

ensured through the effective involvement of the local private sector, MFIs and aggregator 

enterprises in the approach to achieving sustainable settlement of young entrepreneurs and 

access to markets.

4.5 Risk management  
Table 10:  

Risks and mitigation measures 

RISKS LEVEL MITIGATION MEASURE 

Unclear land and state-owned land issues can 

lead to difficulties in exploiting the sites to be 

developed and compromise the objectives of the 

project in terms of food security and the fight 

against poverty, especially for women and young 

people. 

Means Project support for planning and land management 

that will result in the establishment of tripartite 

agreements ( having land rights, municipalities, 

professional organizations) and collective 

agreements to mitigate conflicts 

 Climatic hazards that can accentuate the 
degradation of ecosystems (drought, floods, etc.), 

make communities more vulnerable and promote 

conflict. 

 Limited ownership and management of rural 
infrastructure 

Means  Irrigation, the protection of vulnerable areas, the 
opening up of production areas, the integration of 

climate information into the design of works, the 

securing of income, will mitigate this risk; 

 Capacity building of municipalities, 

 Lack of monitoring of technological innovations 
by communities 

 Weakness in monitoring by municipalities 
(MOD), slow procurement, low capacity of 

technical services and low capacity of enterprises 

Means  Participative approach and involvement, 
organization and training of local actors 

 Funding of a stakeholder capacity building 
program 

The institutional weakness of MINAGRIE in 

terms of management and monitoring and 

evaluation 

Means The capacity building program of MINAGRIE and 

the PMU on project administration, procurement 

and financial management will mitigate this risk 

 

4.6 Knowledge Development 
 

The project will be a disaggregated database, according to the type of reference that will 

be used to establish the baseline situation. Then a map will be produced with geo referencing 

of the activities carried out. This information will be networked and posted on a website to be 

shared with all stakeholders. The same will be true for the results of the independent (rapid and 

in-depth) impact assessments. The actions included in the project that will also lead to 

knowledge development are the popularization of innovative technologies, technology review 

workshops, innovation / multi-stakeholder platforms and exchange visits and support for 

innovative product processing experiments as part of a private partnership / OP; and promoting 

innovative youth and women's employability actions and resilience building activities for 

vulnerable groups. Finally, the project will put in place an integrated knowledge management 

system on project activities through the regular dissemination of acquired knowledge. 
 

V. Legal framework 
 

5.1 Legal instrument 
 

The legal framework of the project will be a TSF Grant Memorandum of Understanding

Project Summary  

 

Overview. 2PAI BÉLIER was identified during the dialogue with the Government of Côte 

d’Ivoire to transform the agricultural sector, using an innovative approach. It aims to lay down 

the prerequisite conditions for the emergence of an agro-industrial pole in the country’s 

heartland and as the first agropolis for the transformation and modernization of Ivorian 

agriculture. It concerns the Bélier administrative region and the Autonomous District of 

Yamoussoukro - a once prosperous zone that has experienced economic decline for three 

decades despite its significant potential. The project prioritizes the integrated approach to 

revive promising value chains and tackle a number of impediments to the development of the 

agricultural and agro-industrial sector. This innovative approach is a clean break from the 

sector-based approach, and is reflected in a critical mass of diversified actions capable of 

sustainably transforming economic activity at the grassroots. The project’s sector objective is 

to contribute to food and nutritional security. The specific objective is to contribute to the 

emergence of an agro-industrial pole in Bélier Region by revitalizing promising agricultural 

sub-sectors (rice, maize, cassava, vegetables, pork and fish) and further involving the private 

sector, youth and women.  

 

The UA 97 million project cost will be financed by an EUR 64.36 million ADB loan, a UA 

26.04 million ADF loan, a UA 3.4 million ADF grant (a total of UA 80 million to be borne by 

the Bank) and by the Government and beneficiaries to the tune of UA 17 million. The project 

has three components: (i) Restoration of productive capital; (ii) Development of value chains; 

and (iii) Project management. The first component aims to endow the region with key 

infrastructure for the development of agricultural and agro-industrial activities (irrigation 

schemes, roads, storage and marketing facilities, livestock infrastructure, electric lines, ICT), 

while also ensuring the best living conditions for the population concerned (DWS 

infrastructure, classrooms, school canteens, health structures). The second component aims to 

support all actors for them to operate dynamically around value chains in a more integrative 

and inclusive environment. The concern will be to: strengthen land security; better structure 

farmers’ organizations and build their technical and managerial capacity; support 

mechanization; develop employment and the recruitment of young graduates, by supporting in 

particular INP-ESA; promote agri-business especially by strengthening the Yamoussoukro 

industrial zone and ICT development; ensure better access to agricultural financing and enable 

better contribution to nutrition. The last component will ensure that the project is managed 

according to schedule and through sound implementation and monitoring arrangements. 

  

The project will benefit 461,600 people (64% of project area residents), 112,000 of them 

directly, 800 young graduates and 200 SMEs (including 50 in produce processing). It will 

benefit about 230,000 women, including 4,300 farmers, 400 young girls and 25 processing-

operators and traders. With estimated additional production of 465,000 tonnes per year, 

additional income per beneficiary is estimated at about CFAF 1.2 million for Model 1 

(representing rice farmers), CFAF 7.2 million for Model 2 (representing market garden 

operators), CFAF 2.5 million for Model 3 (representing rain-fed activities), CFAF 4.8 million 

for Model 4 (representing young farmers), and CFAF 20 million for Model 5 (representing 

SMEs), CFAF 2.5 million for Model 6 (representing pig farmers) and CFAF 4.5 million for 

Model 7 (representing fish farmers). The project will benefit about 112,000 persons directly, 

107,000 of whom would be lifted out of poverty. Thanks to the setting up and organization of 

processing units (50% run by women), 120,000 tonnes of cassava tubers will be processed into 

several by-products. The project will help to raise the agricultural produce processing rate from 

119,000 tonnes currently (51% of total production) to about 581,000 tonnes (85%). It will 

create the equivalent of approximately 19,000 permanent jobs.   

 



 

v 

Needs Assessment: The project area has a population of about 702,000 and covers a land area 

of 11,695 km2. Average population density is 60/km2. It is about 200 km to the North of 

Abidjan. Two out of three people in Bélier Region live with less than one dollar a day (the 

poverty rate in the region is 61.8%, compared to 46.3% nationally). The rationale for the 

intervention is the high level of poverty and the need to revive the region around the once 

prosperous administrative capital that is now in the throes of economic decline, due mostly to 

insufficient investments linked to the socio-economic crisis of the 2000 decade (PADER-Lakes 

approved by ADF in 2000 was not implemented). Therefore, this intervention is urgent since 

it will contribute to establishing a development pole to tap the area’s high potential and meet 

the great expectations and pressing needs expressed by the youth and women.  

 

Bank’s Value Added: The establishment of a technical and financial framework to support 

agri-business is consistent with the Bank’s Medium-Term Intervention Strategy in Regional 

Member Countries, Pillars 1, 2, 3 and 5 of the High 5s (Light up Africa, Feed Africa, 

Industrialize Africa and Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa) and the Bank’s 

new “Feed Africa: Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in Africa, 2016-2025”. The Bank 

provided the Government technical assistance to identify and prepare the project, and expertise 

to develop financial inclusion and technical support in line with CSP 2013-2017. Besides, 

through this operation, the Bank will support Côte d’Ivoire’s efforts to rebuild the country and 

transform its economy - a priority objective of Government’s National Development Plan 

(PND 2016-2020). Unlike previous standard agricultural interventions, this Bank intervention 

will in particular fulfil all necessary conditions for setting up an agro-industrial pole to ensure 

the dynamism of promising agricultural sub-sectors in a given territory. Tangible and intangible 

infrastructure will be integrated to create local value added, improve the productivity of 

agricultural sub-sectors, and spur the produce processing dynamic to ultimately establish a true 

agro-industry as a prerequisite for agricultural sector development.  

 

Knowledge Management: The project will widely disseminate experience and good practice 

garnered during the management of units for agricultural produce production/processing. Thus, 

farmers of both sexes, artisans, processing operators, traders, youths and girls, as well as local 

authorities will acquire new techniques and skills enabling them to better manage their affairs 

and improve their living conditions. Thanks to the project, actors will gain experience on 

managing sub-sectors around inter-professions at the local level. INP-ESA’s involvement in 

helping young graduates to settle will help to endow it with new expertise and offer 

beneficiaries new opportunities in operational and managerial fields. The dissemination of 

knowledge via the monitoring/evaluation system will be done with the involvement of value 

chain actors. State officials involved will have the opportunity to be trained and broaden their 

experience in promising and innovative intervention sectors currently inexistent in the region 

(financial inclusion and framework of technical support to private initiatives).

BÉLIER REGION AGRO-INDUSTRIAL POLE PROJECT (2PAI-BÉLIER) 

 

Management hereby submits this report and recommendations concerning a proposal to extend 

an ADF loan of UA 26.04 million, an ADF grant of UA 3.4 million and an ADB loan of EUR 

64.360 million to the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire to finance the Bélier Region Agro-Industrial 

Pole Project. 

I STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE  

1.1 Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives  

1.1.1 After a period of economic recession caused by the armed conflict of 1999-2011, the 

Ivorian economy gradually picked up thanks to political stability and the support of International 

Technical and Financial Partners. After a negative growth of -4.7% in 2011, GDP growth rose 

to 9.8% in 2012 and 8.3% in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Concurrently, the poverty rate at the national 

level dropped slightly from 48.9% in 2008 to 46.3% in 2015. The National Development Plan 

(PND 2016-2020) that followed the previous PND 2012-2015, is a unique frame of reference 

for public action. It hinges on five strategic thrusts: (1) Strengthen the quality of institutions and 

good governance; (2) Speed up human capital development and promote well-being; (3) Speed 

up structural transformations and industrialization; (4) Develop infrastructure spread 

harmoniously across the country and preserve the environment; and (5) Strengthen regional 

integration and international cooperation. In the area of gender, it intends to promote enrolment 

and literacy among young girls/women and women’s empowerment. Strategic Thrust 3 involves 

developing the agricultural sector as a means for the structural transformation of the country, 

especially by: (i) improving the quality of agricultural produce; (ii) speeding up the 

modernization and enhanced productivity of the agricultural sector; and (iii) speeding up 

product processing. The project is in line with Pillar 2 (Development of support infrastructure 

for economic recovery) of the CSP (2013-2017), confirmed during the March 2016 mid-term 

review.  

1.1.2 The National Agriculture Investment Programme (PNIA-2010-2016) covers priority 

activities in the crop, livestock and fisheries development sectors. It fits into a common global 

ECOWAS Agricultural Policy Framework and Comprehensive African Agriculture 

Development Programme (ECOWAP/PDDAA). On 13 October 2016, Government launched 

the process to prepare the second-generation PNIA (2017-2025) with NEPAD and ECOWAS 

support, to be implemented by PND 2016-2020. The authorities aim to guide and support 

regional and national efforts in the agricultural sector to guarantee that the 6% growth target is 

met and at least 10% of the budget is allocated to the sector (Maputo Commitment). The 

Government plans to increase this allocation rate from 5.4% in 2016 to 7-8% from 2017, and at 

least 10% from 2018. The Government adopted the agropoles development approach in 

designing this new programme and intends to organise a Donors’ Roundtable to ensure its 

financing.  

1.2 Rationale for the Bank’s Intervention 

1.2.1 During the implementation of PNIA, the Government identified a programme jointly 

with the Bank for the transformation of the agricultural sector based on the agropoles approach. 

Given the availability of resources, the country’s absorptive capacity and the security situation, 

dialogue with the authorities led to the planning of this programme, which is divided into three 

agropoles projects whose order of priority was adopted by common agreement during the 

preparation of CSP 2013-2017, and confirmed during the mid-term review. The first project 

titled “Bélier Region Agro-Industrial Pole Project” benefited from a Project Preparation Facility 

(PPF) advance. The second, the Agro-Industrial Support Project in the North of Côte d’Ivoire, 

will be the subject of a PPF advance being studied. The third project concerning the Tonkpi 



 

2 

Region will be studied subsequently. This report is for the first selected project covering the 

Autonomous District of Yamoussoukro (Yamoussoukro and Attiégouakro Départements) and 

the Bélier administrative region (Didiévi, Djékanou, Tiébissou and Toumodi Départements). 

This zone is about 200 km to the North of Abidjan, covers 11,695 km2 and has 702,000 

inhabitants. It has significant agricultural potentials that is yet to be fully tapped, highly 

degraded infrastructure and several private agro-industrial initiatives being developed. This 

zone has been marked by economic recession for three decades, after the decline of the cocoa-

coffee sub-sector (1980s and 90s) and the military-political crisis of 2000 to 2010, then the post-

electoral crisis of 2010-2011 (see Annexes A, B and C).  

1.2.2 Various Bank missions to the project area and the concerted approach highlighted a 

number of major constraints: (i) serious degradation and insufficiency of irrigation and pastoral 

infrastructure (dams, schemes) as well as socio-economic infrastructure (roads, markets, storage 

facilities, schools, drinking water, etc.); (ii) insufficient social cohesion and organization of 

actors, making it impossible for farmers/processing operators/traders to optimize their joint 

activities; (iii) weak land security; (iv) poor mastery of production techniques; (v) inadequate 

access to the factors of production (e.g. quality seeds); (vi) poor mechanization of agricultural 

activities; and (vii) inexistence of a framework of technical and financial support to private 

initiatives, industrialization and value chains integration, particularly those that are promising 

for youths. A few development projects exist in the region and private initiatives are emerging 

(SIPRA, INTERVALLE, Aurore, etc.). These offer opportunities for ultimately developing 

PPP-type operations. Although local development is constrained by farmer/grazier conflicts and 

climate change, the region (whose headquarter is Yamoussoukro, the country’s administrative 

capital) has first-class infrastructure suitable for economic revitalization, particularly with the 

commissioning of the Abidjan-Yamoussoukro motorway in 2014, the existence of an 

international airport and the presence of a world-class university complex. By virtue of its 

integrated approach, the project is consistent with four (4) of the Bank’s High 5s: (1) Feed 

Africa; (2) Light up Africa; (3) Industrialize Africa; and (5) Improve the quality of life for the 

people of Africa. In particular, it is in line with the Bank’s new Feed Africa: Strategy for 

Agricultural Transformation in Africa, 2016-2025, which implements Pillar 1 focused inter alia 

on higher investments in tangible and intangible infrastructure, mobilization of agricultural 

financial flows, agricultural produce processing, youth employment, the development of 

agropoles and agro-food industry. It is also consistent with the Bank’s Gender Strategy (2014-

2018), especially its second pillar aimed at strengthening women’s economic empowerment, 

and the Bank’s Strategy for Addressing Fragility and Building Resilience, 2014-2019. 

1.3 Aid Coordination  

1.3.1 The Agricultural Infrastructure Development Support Project in Indénié-Djuablin 

Region (PAIA-ID) is the Bank’s only active project in the agricultural sector. It was approved 

in March 2012 (UA 21.6 million grant) and, since October 2016, benefited from a 

supplementary NTF loan of UA 4 million to strengthen agri-business activities. The project 

status is satisfactory since the disbursement rate in November 2016 was 57%. Apart from the 

Bank, many development partners have interventions in the agricultural sector in Côte d’Ivoire 

including the FAO, the World Bank, WADB, the EU, AFD, WFP, IsDB, IFAD, BADEA, JICA, 

GIZ, Spanish Cooperation, Chinese Economic Cooperation and the Indian Government. These 

partners belong to the “Agriculture, Rural Development and Environment” Sector Group, which 

seeks to facilitate consultation and dialogue with the Ivorian Government. Another partner 

group, the Nutrition Sector Group, also works closely with the Agriculture Sector Group.  

1.3.2 FAO supported the Government in several post-crisis operations as well as in the 

design of development thrusts and operationalization of PNIA, especially in the area of rural 

land. In particular, the World Bank finances a multi-national Research Programme in West 

Africa (PPAAO/WAAPP, 2013-2016) that promotes agricultural sector productivity. Its 



 

3 

innovative outcomes can be capitalized in 2PAI-Bélier, especially in terms of new food 

processing technologies for vegetables and cassava. Since 2013, AFD has been financing the 

Project for the Acceleration of Agricultural Sub-Sectors in Côte d’Ivoire (PARFACI) and co-

finances with the World Bank the Agricultural Sector Promotion Project in Côte d’Ivoire 

(PSAC). PARFACI supports the market gardening, pork and fish sub-sectors as well as the land 

sector in Bélier, Gontougo, Poro and Tchologo regions. On completion in mid-2017, it will be 

relayed in its foodstuff component in Bélier region by 2PAI-Bélier especially by supporting the 

market gardening, pork and fish sub-sectors. The EU interventions are in the cash crop/food 

crop sub-sectors, rural land security, agricultural training, the fight against infectious animal 

diseases (epizooty), as well as the health safety of export products. JICA intervention in Bélier 

Region via the Local Rice Promotion Project (PRORIL) is in the form of a technical assistance 

operation to strengthen the capacity of actors in the local rice sub-sector. JICA also supported 

Government to prepare an agricultural mechanization strategy and is preparing a project for its 

operationalization. 2PAI-BÉLIER will forge synergies with all ongoing projects, including 

PARFACI, PRORIL and PPAAO/WAAPP. 

1.3.3 FAO and AFD play a leading role in the “Agriculture, Rural Development and 

Environment” Technical and Financial Partners Group (TFPG). This group has an internal land 

security sub-group with the EU as lead agency and the AfDB, AFD, WB and FAO as members. 

As part of the TFPG, regular consultations are organized in Abidjan, with Bank participation.

II PROJECT DESCRIPTION  

 

2.1 Project Objectives and Components 

 

2.1.1 The project’s sector objective is to contribute to enhancing food and nutritional 

security. The specific objective is to contribute to the emergence of an agro-industrial pole in 

Bélier Region through the revitalization of promising agricultural sub-sectors and greater 

involvement of the private sector, youths and women.  

 

2.1.2 Project Design Elements. The project aims to put in place the prerequisite conditions 

for the emergence of an agro-industrial pole to transform and modernize agriculture in the 

erstwhile prosperous Bélier Region, which has experienced economic decline for three decades, 

despite its significant potential. To revive agriculture around promising value chains, the project 

prioritizes an integrated approach to resolve the many impediments to the development of the 

agricultural and agro-industrial sector (infrastructure, factors of production, organization of 

actors and sub-sectors, market integration, access to financing, etc.). The paradigm underlying 

the project’s design is to consider the agricultural and rural sector as a system with mutually 

inter-acting constituent elements. The novelty of this approach, which represents a clean break 

from the sector-based approach, lies in the critical mass of diversified actions capable of 

reviving and sustainably transforming economic activity at the local level. The project is 

founded on the value-chains and sector-integration approach to create a conducive environment 

for private sector involvement, development of community initiatives and employment of 

youths and women. It will bring about the region’s industrialization through the creation of a 

technical assistance framework, a financial arrangement, the promotion of private investments 

and the implementation of several ambitious mechanization, technical innovation, youth 

employment and human capital development programmes. The financial arrangement to 

accompany the approach will comprise: (i) financial support to strengthen the financial capacity 

of banks and decentralized financing systems through a refinancing line; (ii) a Guarantee Fund 

to contribute to mitigating the risk; (iii) an interest rate improvement fund; and (iv) technical 

assistance to financing institutions and targeted beneficiaries (the details of this component are 

given in paragraphs C3.47 to C3.52 of Annex C3 of Volume 2). 

 

2.1.3 Summary of Components: Project implementation will span five years. It will have

2.2 Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Explored  

 

2.2.1 The technical solutions adopted for infrastructure are based on standards ensuring the 

sustainability of investments at acceptable costs and targeting good beneficiary ownership. 

Rural roads will be rehabilitated in accordance with the technical standards defined by the Road 

Management Agency (AGEROUTE). Special attention will be given to the treatment of critical 

points as this will allow for an uninterrupted flow of traffic in all seasons to and from most 

localities. For irrigated areas, the project prioritized the rehabilitation of existing gravity-based 

structures upstream the dam, extending somewhere available water so allows. Some degraded 

dams will also be consolidated to avoid the risk of submersion or rupture. As regards the 

development of marshy areas and market gardens, the traditional techniques used will be 

improved and modernized to lighten the work and introduce greater efficiency. For marshy 

areas, the concern will be to better regulate high-water levels and gravity-based distribution of 



 

6 

water through suitable works. For gardens, this will involve ensuring water drainage while 

promoting localized irrigation techniques (drip method, spray irrigation, etc.). New areas will 

be irrigated to encourage private community initiatives and meet different market needs. 

Marketing buildings will be constructed according to standards usually applied in the country 

through various projects. 

 
Table 2.2: Alternative Solutions Explored and Reasons for Rejection 

Alternative Solution Brief Description 

 

Reason for Rejection 

 

Construction of new dams 

with schemes downstream 

Creation of new retention dams by 

developing irrigated areas. 

 Numerous existing dams with under-developed schemes 
downstream whose rehabilitation is priority, considering 

the available financial resources. 

 Costly investments not justified given the potential already 
in place but not fully tapped. 

Laying out of large 

schemes fed via pumping 

Develop new irrigated areas of 

several hectares while ensuring 

water supply through pumping 

 High cost of maintaining schemes than for gravity-based 
networks. 

 Priority given to medium-sized and insufficiently 
developed gravity-based schemes. 

Light re-profiling of roads Light treatment of wearing course 

in place 

 Life cycle generally below one year. 
 Unsuitable solution for roads not having been the subject 

of initial rehabilitation. 

 Accessibility not assured because of many critical points 
and crossings. 

 

2.3 Project Type 

 

2PAI-BÉLIER is an autonomous operation in the form of a Loan/Grant for an investment 

project. The country is far advanced in the PDDAA process with the existence of PNIA and 

preparation of a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). Pending completion of the 

process, most donor interventions in the sector are undertaken through targeted investment 

projects.  

 

2.4 Project Cost and Financing Arrangements  

 

2.4.1 The project’s total cost, net of taxes and customs duty, is estimated at UA 97 million 

(approximately CFAF 80.99 billion), including UA 32.50 million (CFAF 27.14 billion) in 

foreign exchange and UA 64.49 million (CFAF 53.85 billion) in local currency. A rate of 5 to 

10% for physical contingencies on works and equipment, making a total of UA 4.4 million for 

this heading or 4.5% of the total project cost, was also factored in. A provision of 3% for 

composite price escalation was applied to all components. Summary cost estimates by 

component and by expenditure category are presented in the tables below. Detailed tables of 

project costs and the list of goods and services are attached as Annexes D5 and D6 of Volume

2.4.2 Project Financing. The project will be financed by: (i) an ADB loan of EUR 64.36 

million (UA 50.56 million), an ADF Grant of UA 3.4 million and an ADF Loan of UA 26.04 

million, making a total of UA 80 million (82.5% of total cost); and (ii) the counterpart 

contribution by the Government and beneficiaries amounting to UA 17 million (CFAF 14.1 

billion), or 17.5% of the total cost. The grant includes the Bank’s UA 998,000 PPF advance to 

the Ivorian Government in February 2015 as well as the service fee. This advance will be 

reimbursed in accordance with PPF’s operational guidelines. Government’s counterpart 

contribution will finance the cost of irrigation schemes, the routine maintenance of roads 

(RMF), the settlement of customary rights in the industrial zone, the rehabilitation/extension of 

the erstwhile PADER-Lakes buildings to serve as project offices and part of operating costs. 

Beneficiaries’ contribution of UA 267,000 (CFAF 223 million), or 3% of the total project cost, 

will be used for irrigation scheme and human water works. The distribution of project financing 

is indicated in Table 2.5 below while Tables 2.6 and 2.7 show the distribution of the grant and

2.5 Project Target Area and Beneficiaries  

2.5.1 The project area covers the Autonomous District of Yamoussoukro (Yamoussoukro 

and Attiégouakro Départements) and Bélier Administrative Region (Diediévi, Djékanou, 

Tiebessou and Toumodi Départements). It is about 200 km to the North of Abidjan and covers 

11,695 km2. The climate is of the humid tropical or Sudano-Guinean type. Recent studies on 

rainfall in this region over a period of 30 years (1980-2010) show an irregular distribution of 

rain with annual values ranging between 1,000 and 1,200 mm. The effects of climate change 

are increasingly felt, leading to disruptions in the planting/harvest calendar. Nevertheless, the 

project area has high agricultural and water potential, characterized by a fairly flat relief crossed 

by a dense hydrographic network (Bandama, N’Zi and Kan Rivers) This hydrography offers the 

region good opportunities for rice cultivation, fishing and fish-farming, which remain untapped. 

According to the 2014 General Population and Housing Census (RGPH 2014), the project area 

has a population of 702,000 of which 51% male and 49% female. Poverty rose from 41.4% in 

2002 to 61.8% in 2015 in Bélier Region and from 25% to 39.4% in Yamoussoukro District 

(INS-ENV2015). Average annual income per capita is CFAF 373,504 in urban areas and CFAF 

246,122 in rural areas. These values are lower than at the national level where they are CFAF 

467,080 and CFAF 256,538. The prevalence of chronic malnutrition stands at 30.4% (SMART 

2011) and underweight at 17.3% (EDS 2012). These ratios reflect a very preoccupying 

nutritional situation, considering that the acceptable threshold of chronic malnutrition is 20%.  

2.5.2 Due to the major constraints for the region’s development and economic recovery (see 

1.2.2), Bélier Region was prioritized during the identification mission undertaken with Bank 

support (see Annex B of Volume 2). This choice was also guided by the significant potential 

that exists but which remains untapped, the existing anchor infrastructure (motorway, airport), 

the existence of a world-class university complex (INPHB), the need to revitalize the region 

around Yamoussoukro, the country’s administrative capital, which has experienced economic 

decline for several decades. It was also guided by the urgency to help the region’s population 

who expect a far-reaching development intervention (the Lacs Region Rural Development 

Support Project assessed by ADF in 2000 was not implemented because disbursements were 



 

9 

suspended in 2002 at the start of the armed conflict in Côte d’Ivoire). The project’s beneficiaries 

are value chain actors, organized as groups or cooperatives, as well as private operators with 

SME status. The project will directly benefit about 112,000 people in all. Its impact on 

employment is significant due to the creation of the equivalent of about 19,000 permanent jobs 

(approximately 4.8 million workdays). 

2.6 Participatory Approach in Project Identification, Design and Implementation  

The project was the subject of wide consultations at all stages of its study. Contacts made during 

the identification mission in March 2013 were continued during the preparatory (June 2015) 

and appraisal (June 2016) phases in Bélier Region, Yamoussoukro District and Abidjan. 

Meetings were held with the administrative authorities, local communities, technical structures, 

farmers’ organizations, women’s groups, private partners, ongoing projects and TFPs involved. 

Several workshops were organized during PPF implementation to select irrigation sites and road 

sections to be rehabilitated. Moreover, the project’s implementation will require the putting in 

place of mechanisms closely involving and empowering the various value chain actors. Since 

the sustainability of interventions, especially those concerning irrigation infrastructure, would 

require the full ownership of the parties concerned, the option was taken to target in priority the 

most committed communities that also fulfil the selection criteria (explicitly made request, land 

security, organization method, contributions and commitments, etc.). For the different sub-

sectors affected, the project will support the establishment of platforms to facilitate synergy 

among stakeholders and by systematically involving those of the private sector. Periodic 

meetings and information campaigns will be financed by the project to ensure proper 

communication and enable participatory decision-making by the actors. 

2.7 Consideration of Bank Group Experience and Lessons Learned in Project Design 

The Bank finances the Agricultural Infrastructure Development Support Project in the Indénié-

Djuablin Region (see 1.3.1). Lessons drawn from the project’s mid-term review were considered 

in the design of 2PAI-BÉLIER, including: (i) greater consideration of the value chains approach 

and promotion of private investment; (ii) optimization of the performance of delegated 

contracting authorities through a better definition of roles and tasks; (iii) expected improvement 

of the procurement process by enhancing the quality of procurement dossiers with a view to 

recruiting competent contractors and firms; and (iv) establishment of competent human 

resources for an efficient management of activities, including cross-cutting aspects 

(environment and gender). The table in Annex C1 details measures taken to reflect the lessons 

learned. An additional NTF financing in the form of a UA 4 million loan was approved by the 

Bank Board of Directors on 21 October 2016 to support agri-business activities. Value chains 

and the role played by the private sector was reflected in the project design. Overall, the project 

design benefited from the pilot initiatives of the Feed Africa Strategy in terms of the 

development of agropoles, youth employment and agriculture financing with shared risks.  

2.8 Key Performance Indicators  

2.8.1 The key performance indicators presented in the logical framework will be refined 

through the project’s baseline situation. The outcome indicators include: (i) outputs and 

production; (ii) additional production processed and marketed; (iii) higher revenue and income 

generation for farmers and settled youths; (iv) the number of women and youths having 

benefited from project support; (v) the average time of electricity cuts in the industrial zone and 

in the town of Didiévi. The main output indicators are: (i) the irrigated surface area laid out, 

rehabilitated or developed; (ii) the number of infrastructure constructed or rehabilitated 

(consolidation centres, rural markets, storage facilities, etc.); (iii) the number of bore holes and 

pumps for rehabilitated DWS; (iv) the linear distance of roads and electric lines restored; (v) 

the number of agricultural groupings and professional organizations (OPA), youths and women 



 

10 

trained or settled in various fields; (vi) the effectiveness of support systems in place 

(mechanization programme, development fund, ICT, etc.); and (vii) the number of senior staff 

and agents of technical services trained.  

2.8.2 Other gender-specific indicators will be added during finalization of the 

monitoring/evaluation system and establishment of the baseline situation, according to the 

results-based management approach. These include: (i) the proportion of women in each 

beneficiary group; (ii) the involvement of women and youths in farmers’ and infrastructure 

management groupings; (iii) the number of land certificates issued to women and youths; (iv) 

the number of women and young graduates settled; and (v) the number of people benefiting 

from the bio-fortification programme. Special emphasis will be laid on the monitoring of socio-

economic impacts (gender- and youth-disaggregated data, monitoring of FO performance, 

turnover of very small enterprises, etc.).  

III PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1 Economic and Financial Performance 

3.1.1 The project’s financial and economic performance was assessed over a 25-year 

period. The calculation of project benefits was based on an estimation of additional outputs 

under the project combined with the effects of an increase in the sown land surface due to works 

(Component A) and the technology package adopted (Component B). The analysis took into 

account the characteristics of agricultural plantations in a without-project and with-project 

scenarios, and the trend of the technical level illustrated by activity fact sheets. More precisely, 

the project benefits come from: (i) the increase in productivity (rice, maize, cassava, vegetables, 

pork and fish); (ii) the increase in the productivity and surface area of rain-fed cultivation; (iii) 

and the increase in the income of youths and SMEs benefiting from the project’s technical and 

financial support.  

3.1.2 In terms of economic profitability, the project has an economic rate of return (ERR) of 

30% and Net Present Value (NPV) of CFAF 123 billion at an opportunity cost of capital of 

12%. These results are deemed satisfactory in light of project activities. The project is more 

sensitive to a decrease in production than to an increase in investment costs. A 10% decrease in 

expected production induces an ERR of 26.8% and a 10% increase in investment costs gives an 

ERR of 28.7%. A 10% decrease in production at the same time as a 10% increase in investment 

costs gives an ERR of 24.9%, which is still above the opportunity cost of capital (12%). The 

assumptions and detailed calculation of financial and economic analyses are presented in Annex 

E1 of Volume 2.  

Table 3.1: Main Economic and Financial Data 

Outcome Assessment Economic 

NPV (baseline scenario: discount rate: 12%) CFAF 123 billion 

Economic Rate of Return (ERR) 30% 

3.1.3 The analysis of the project’s financial performance shows positive additional income 

for all operating models studied. The project will benefit about 11,900 farmers including about 

1,600 for irrigated areas, 8,500 for rain-fed crops and 800 young graduates, as well as 200 SMEs 

(50 of them in produce processing), 150 pig breeders and 100 fish farmers. The project’s impact 

is significant for all plantation types studied, returns being higher for models representing 

irrigated agriculture. The additional income by model are as follows: CFAF 1.2 million for 

Model M1 representing farmers in rice-growing areas (about CFAF 1.2 billion in all), CFAF 7.2 

million for Model M2 representing market gardening farmers (CFAF 4.9 billion in all), CFAF 



 

11 

2.5 million for Model M3 representing rain-fed activities (CFAF 22 billion in all), CFAF 4.8 

million for Model M4 representing young farmers (CFAF 3.8 billion in all), and CFAF 20 

million for Model M5 representing SMEs (CFAF 2 billion in all), CFAF 2.5 million for Model 

M6 representing pig breeders (CFAF 375 million in all) and CFAF 4.5 million for Model M7 

representing fish farmers (CFAF 450 million in all). The project will directly benefit about 

112,000 people with 107,000 of them are expected to be eased out of poverty. It will create the 

equivalent of about 19,000 permanent jobs in the region (see Annex E1 of Volume 2).  

3.2 Environmental and Social Impact 

3.2.1 Environment. The project was classified in Environmental Category 2 since it has 
negligible impact on the environment and will not require population displacement. The 

Environmental and Social Management Plan was approved by ORQR and published on the Bank’s 

website on 18 November 2016. The project will have both positive and negative environmental and 

social impacts. The rehabilitation of irrigated areas (dykes and networks) will cause little 

destruction to ecosystems. Possible scheme extensions will lead only to the felling of a few 

shrubs and uprooting of secondary bushes made up largely by pennisetum purpureum. The same 

is true for impacts of the construction zone of the Raviart mini-dam where: (i) the water storage 

area has deteriorated greatly due to frequent bush fires and illegal logging of the gallery forest; 

and (ii) the poor exploitation of marshy areas by farmers who are not accustomed to it; the few 

cashew nut trees planted close to the marshy areas cover small areas that can easily be 

compensated by the activities of the Climate Change Based Project undertaken concurrently in 

the 2PAI-BÉLIER zone. Socially, the rehabilitation of structures can lead some land owners, 

most of whom are settlers, to over-price agricultural plantations in marshy zones. The 

rehabilitation of rural roads will not cause significant environmental impacts. The same is true 

of the rehabilitation and extension of socio-economic infrastructure (markets, health centres, 

schools and canteens, energy and ICT, fishing and livestock infrastructure, etc.). This 

infrastructure can only improve and ensure the sustainability of the positive impacts expected 

from the implementation of 2PAI-BÉLIER Project activities. The analysis of negative impacts 

reveals two major observations: (i) project activities will neither cause population displacement 

nor seriously undermine biological diversity; and (ii) negative impacts can be mitigated or 

minimized through the measures defined in the 2PAI-BÉLIER ESMP that was prepared during 

the appraisal mission (Annex E of Volume 2). 

3.2.2 Climate Change: Spatial and temporal variations in rainfall patterns are a real cause 

for concern for the conduct of activities in the project area as well as across the country. 

Activities directly concerned are rain-fed agriculture and activities undertaken in lowlands 

developed as water catchment in case of pronounced water shortages. For lowlands on dams to 

be rehabilitated, technical measures will be taken during works to minimize the effects of high-

water level in case of abundant rains (overflow for excess water and networks of drains). To 

mitigate erosion of the banks of lowlands, the project will ensure that good agricultural practices 

are applied, while encouraging farmers to build anti-erosion strips. Tools for implementing alert 

procedures (i.e. collection and processing of climate data and mechanisms for their 

communication to actors) are inadequate and/or obsolete. The project will contribute to 

improving these procedures in the region by: (i) increasing the number of rain gauges in the 

sub-prefectures and villages hosting project sites; and (ii) providing more equipment, 

strengthening capacity to collect and process data and means of communication. The emphasis 

on the rehabilitation of irrigation schemes is in itself a contribution to build the resilience of 

agricultural production systems. The project will support all activities already undertaken in the 

region by WAAPP/PPAAO and CNRA concerning the dissemination of reputedly drought-

resistant plant varieties. The energy component will help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 

by resorting less to diesel generators (the alternative source when power supplied by the national 

grid becomes unavailable). Besides, as part of the Global Climate Change Initiative (FIP, 

REDD+) financed by the Climate Strategy Fund (SCF), the Bank will support agroforestry and 



 

12 

the creation of forest plantations in the Centre, including in Bélier Region. This intervention 

will be in the form of a project whose appraisal will take place in the first quarter of 2017. This 

project is to be implemented in synergy with 2PAI BÉLIER. It will help to reduce greenhouse 

gas emissions, increase carbon sequestration and build the resilience of production systems. 

3.2.3 Gender Impacts. Women make up 49.6% of the population in the project area. Most 

of them engage in agriculture, in particular in the food value chains (cassava production and 

processing, market gardening produce production and marketing, rice steaming, etc.). Women 

are often confined to less fertile and less irrigated parcels due to the difficulty they encounter in 

accessing landed property. In general, women farm extensively on small areas (about one ha), 

practicing shifting cultivation with few factors of production. Often, agricultural outreach is 

undertaken at their expense because it targets cash crops and organized sub-sectors that are 

dominated by men. Women use old and precarious processing equipment. Most of them do not 

know their rights, are poorly organized and are victims of all manners of violence (sexual, 

physical, psychological, economic, harmful traditional practices, denial of opportunities). 

3.2.4 Considering these constraints and the concentration of 2PAI Bélier on food sub-

sectors, the project’s gender strategy will promote women’s empowerment and gender equality 

in access to project services and resources, the implementation of each of its components, 

community representation and decision-making. In this regard, the project will facilitate 

women’s access to land by facilitating the access of close to 2,200 women to the restored 

irrigated areas. Furthermore, 50% of land certificates, the issuance of which will be facilitated 

by the project, will be set aside for women. The project will lay special emphasis on promoting 

women’s equitable access to technologies, mechanized equipment, inputs (seeds, fertilizers and 

pest-control products), supervision services and financing on a par with men. It will support 

women to procure modern cassava processing and rice-steaming equipment. Rehabilitated 

markets will take into account the specific needs of women, especially cold rooms, and include 

gender-separate sanitation facilities, day care facilities and literacy centres. The project will 

facilitate the evacuation and sale of agricultural produce by establishing platforms, setting up 

farmer/trader contracting systems and rehabilitating rural roads. The project’s “Youth training 

and settlement programme” component will reach about 400 young girls, or 50% of the 

beneficiaries of the said programme. In addition, at least 40% of enterprises managed by women 

will be integrated in the project’s “SME support” component.  

3.2.5 At the strategic level, specific measures and actions will be taken to develop women’s 

leadership and remedy the significant illiteracy rate. A package of integrated services aimed at 

building suitable technical and social capacity, as well as life skills (family planning, HIV/AIDS 

control and violence against women, etc.) necessary for their empowerment will be provided. 

The project will also work to better structure women’s organizations around selected sites by 

ensuring that woman represent 50% of members of various committees and bureaus of 

cooperatives or professional organizations targeted. The project will also work to endow the 

selected support, supervisory or training structures and agricultural professional organizations 

and management units with real technical capacity in gender mainstreaming/inclusion based on 

a gender organizational audit. The Ecole Supérieure d’Agronomie (Advanced School of 

Agronomy, ESA) will be supported to incorporate gender-based modules in its training 

curriculum to enable the country have agronomy and agricultural specialists who are sensitive 

to gender issues. The project will produce the gender profile of the Bélier Region agricultural 

sector, including Yamoussoukro District, which will serve to define indicators for measuring 

gender equality. A gender specialist within the Project Management Unit will monitor gender 

activities. 

3.2.6 Achieving this project’s gender-mainstreaming objectives depends on the knowledge 

and capacity of different sector actors. Therefore, it is necessary from project commencement, 

to undertake training, sensitization and communication actions for a change of behaviour. 



 

13 

Furthermore, the project must sustain the achievements of women in their sectors of activity. In 

this regard, a strict monitoring must be undertaken so that women are not excluded in their 

production sectors (these sectors are bound to become more attractive for men due to the 

modernization of factors of production and an increase in income accruing therefrom).  

3.2.7 Women will benefit from all project activities for a cost amounting to approximately 

UA 58 million. Moreover, a budget of CFAF 1.4 billion (or UA 1.7 million) will be allocated 

specifically to implement targeted actions to empower women and promote gender in the project 

area’s agricultural sector. 

3.2.8 Youth Employment and Inclusion: The project area had 702,000 inhabitants in 2014 

(RGPH data), a third of whom are youths. Despite their predominance in the labour force, 

youths are less occupied and the most vulnerable on the labour market. The national 

employment situation prepared by AGEPE based on 2014 employment data reveals that youths 

are the least active in terms of occupation (59.2% against 66% for the entire labour force), the 

most unemployed (8.3% against 7% for the whole) and the most inactive (32.7% against 2.7%). 

Young men are relatively more occupied (53.5%) whereas young woman are relatively more 

unemployed (58.6%). The level of education of youths is higher (average duration of studies of 

8.8 years against 6.6 years for the entire population of working age). Furthermore, the level of 

education is higher among unemployed youths than among active employed youths (average 

duration of studies is 9.9 years against 7.9 years). Further, youths aged 14-24 years constitute a 

significant percentage of labour in the informal sector compared to the entire population 

(91.1%), more so for young men (94.1%).  

3.2.9 The project will contribute to improving youth employment indicators. It will also 

enhance production and marketing conditions (irrigation infrastructure, roads, markets, etc.), as 

well as access to innovative technologies and factors of production (inputs, equipment, etc.). 

This material capacity building, coupled with stronger technical and financial capacity, will 

boost the productivity of activities undertaken, increase income and prompt the youths to return 

to farming. Besides, during the establishment and/or rehabilitation of irrigation schemes, youths 

will be called up to provide labour. The young artisans of the region will also see their capacity 

strengthened and will thus ensure better services to the satisfaction of producers. This capacity 

building will be undertaken jointly with the Regional Trades Chamber. The platforms envisaged 

by the project for different sub-sectors will help to increase the number of clients and young 

artisans, and resolve issues of unpaid services due to poor produce sales. The project will 

facilitate the implementation of a specific study on the situation of artisans in Bélier Region, 

including Yamoussoukro District. This will provide exhaustive and relevant data for the 

professionalization of the sector, and a better participation of artisans in the establishment of 

the envisaged agro-industrial pole.  

3.2.10 Under its “Support to entrepreneurship” component, the project will foster youth self-

employment. Ongoing initiatives in different local communities (Yamoussoukro Autonomous 

District, Tiébissou mayor) to establish young entrepreneurs will be supported by the project. To 

that end, grants for the establishment of youths will awarded for the conduct of short-duration 

(at most three months) qualifying training programmes. For that, the project will build on the 

expertise of École Supérieure d’Agronomie (ESA). A consultancy firm will be solicited to 

support young entrepreneurs to prepare their feasibility studies. Young girls will make up at 

least 30% of young entrepreneurs supported. The installation of agro-industrial units will also 

contribute to increasing youth employment, as is the case with the Toumodi cassava industrial 

processing unit. Therefore, the project should support access to financing to develop ongoing 

initiatives and facilitate the establishment of new operators.

IV IMPLEMENTATION  

4.1 Implementation Arrangement 

4.1.1 Implementation Arrangements: The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development 

(MINADER) will be the project executing agency. The day-to-day management of the project 

will be ensured by the project coordination team, which will be under the supervision of the 

General Directorate of Planning, Statistics and Projects (DGPSP) based in the vacant premises 

of defunct PADER-Lakes that will be enlarged. The project is in line with Presidential Directive 

No. 02/2015 particularly paragraphs 3, 4 and 4.1. Staff for the coordination team are being 

recruited and studies and BDs of flagship components (rehabilitation of irrigation schemes and 

roads) are available, thanks to activities undertaken under the PPF advance (see Annex C). 

4.1.2 The main tasks of the team are the coordination, control and monitoring of all project 

activities, as well as the information and contact of the different actors. The team will comprise 

a Coordinator, a specialist in charge of technical operations, an Administrative and Finance 

Specialist, a Monitoring/Evaluation Specialist, a specialist responsible for the farmers’ 

organizations support service, a Procurement Specialist, a Rural Engineering Specialist, a 

Specialist in Agri-business, a Specialist in the Livestock and Fisheries Sub-sector, a Specialist 

in Agricultural Credit, an Environmentalist Specialist, a Gender Specialist and support staff. 

The members of the coordination team being recruited as part of the PPF advance will sign 

performance contracts with the implementation unit. Renewal of such contracts shall be subject 

to annual review. Only senior staff whose performance is deemed satisfactory will be 

maintained. The Borrower will submit to the Bank evidence of appointment of the project 

coordinator (“Condition Precedent to First Disbursement”) within at most six months after 

effectiveness and evidence of the designation of the rest of the team (“Other Condition”). A 

technical committee will support DGPSP in activities to render the loan effective and implement 

the project (monitor the recruitment of the coordination team, etc.). It will comprise members 

from MINADER, technical directorates of Ministries in charge of youth employment and 

livestock/fishery resources and technical advisers from Ministries in charge of the Budget, 

Economy and Finance. The committee’s mandate shall not exceed six months following the 

signature of Agreements. The travel expenses of members of this committee will be borne by 

the State’s counterpart contribution to PPF.  

4.1.3 Steering: The project will be steered by a national committee bringing together the 

representatives of the following Ministries: (i) Ministry of Planning and Development; (ii); 

Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development; (iii) Ministry in charge of the Economy and 

Finance; (iv) Ministry in charge of the Budget; (v) Ministry of Trade; (vi) Ministry of Economic 

Infrastructure; (vii) Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development; (viii) Ministry 
of the Family, the Woman and the Child; (ix) Ministry of Livestock and Fishery Resources; (x) 

Ministry of Youth Promotion and Employment and Civil Service; (xi) Ministry of Industry and 

Mines; (xii) General Confederation of Enterprises of Côte d’Ivoire; (xiii) the National 

Association of Agricultural Professional Organizations; and (xiv) the Group of Women’s 

Organizations for Gender Equality. The Steering Committee will be chaired by the 

representative of the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, and its technical 

secretariat will be managed by the Directorate in charge of Planning in the DGPSP. An inter-

ministerial order will be signed in this regard. This committee will meet at least twice yearly to 

consider the outputs and outcomes obtained, approve progress reports and annual work 

programmes and budgets, clear possible blockages and constraints, and ensure that activities 

implemented are consistent with national strategies and policies. The Borrower will submit to 

the Bank evidence of creating a National Steering Committee latest six months following 

effectiveness of the loans. This constitutes the “Other Condition”.

4.1.4 Regional Consultative Framework (CRC): This framework targets the harmonization 

of development interventions, local arbitration and the quest for regional balance. It will be 

chaired by the Préfet of the region. The Regional Director of Agriculture will handle the 

technical secretariat. A ministerial order will be signed to that end (Annex D1.3 of Volume 2). 

4.1.5 Associated Agencies: The project will forge partnership or delegated supervisory 

(MOD) relations, through agreements, with specialized experienced agencies to execute or 

monitor tasks falling within their spheres of competence. These include the National Rural 

Development Support Agency (ANADER) for agricultural supervision and outreach; ONDR 

for monitoring works in rice-growing areas; the Foodstuffs Marketing Assistance Authority 

(OCPV) for marketing related arrangements; the Roads Management Agency (AGEROUTE) 

for the delegated supervision of roads; the Territorial Directorate of Human Water Management 

(DTHH), for the supervision of drinking water works; the Investment Promotion Centre of Côte 

d’Ivoire (CEPICI) to monitor the projects of agricultural enterprises; the National Polytechnic 

Institute – Ecole Supérieure d’Agronomie (INP-ESA) and the Youth Employment Agency for the 

implementation of the youth training/incubation/settlement programme and some technical 

directorates of MINADER, MIRAH, Ministries in charge of the environment, women’s 

advancement and the child and the Ministry of Industry for activities falling within their 

respective spheres of competence.  

4.1.6 Procurement Procedures: The procurement of goods (including services other than 

those of consultants), works and consultancy services financed by the Bank as part of this 

project, will be done in accordance with the Procurement Policy for Bank Group Funded 

Operations, October 2015 edition and pursuant to the terms of the Financing Agreement. 

Specifically, procurements will be done in accordance with: (i) Côte d’Ivoire’s procurement 

system (SPM): Procurement methods and procedures (MPA) as part of the procurement system 

of Côte d’Ivoire comprising its laws and implementing decrees (Decree No. 2009-259 of 6 

August 2009 instituting the Public Procurement Code as amended and supplemented by 

Decrees No. 2014-306 of 27 May 2014 and No. 2015-525 of 15 July 2015 and various 

implementing orders), using standard national bidding documents (DNSAO) or other bidding 

documents approved during project negotiations for various types of activities envisaged; (ii) 

Bank Procurement Methods and Procedures (BPM): standard Bank procurement methods, 

based on relevant standard BDs for consulting service contracts deemed to be most suitable.  

4.1.7 Risk Assessment and Procurement Capacity (RAPC): The risk at country, project 

and sector level, and executing agency’s capacity in project-related procurements were assessed 

and the results are reflected in Table D2.20 of Annex D2. Deemed moderate, the risk guided 

the choice of the procurement system (Borrower, Bank or Third Party) used for given activities 

or all similar activities under the project. The appropriate risk mitigation measures identified 

were included in the PERCA action plan indicated in para. D.2.30. of Annex D2. 

4.1.8 Waiver of Eligibility: Considering that part of this project’s financing is through the 

ADB Window and that some procurements will be done pursuant to the Côte d’Ivoire 

procurement system, a formal request is made to the Board of Directors of the Bank to waive 

the rule of origin for procurements made pursuant to the national procurement system. Since 

the public procurement eligibility rules in Ivorian law are not the same as those of the ADB 

Window, it is necessary to prevent any practical incompatibility. For project procurements using 

the national system, the eligibility rules are national ones in addition to the provisions of 

paragraph 5.c of the Bank Policy on Procurement. Consequently, even using the national 

system, Bank resources cannot serve to finance a contract awarded to a bidder under sanctions 

by the African Development Bank Group. If or in spite of these provisions, a contract is 

concluded with a bidder under sanction by the Bank Group, such contract shall not be financed 

with Bank resources. However, procurements made pursuant to the Bank’s Procurement 

Methods and Procedures will comply with the rule of origin as defined in Article 17 (1) (d) of 

the Agreement Establishing the African Development Bank. 



 

16 

4.1.9 Financial Management and Disbursement: The overall fiduciary risk of the 

project executing agency was assessed and deemed moderate. Côte d’Ivoire issued Decree 

No. 2015-415 in July 2015 to organize the preparation, implementation and closing of projects 

co-financed with Technical and Financial Partners (TFPs). It is in line with the Paris Declaration 

on Development Aid Effectiveness, especially the use of the recipient’s national procedures. 

The decree determines all administration and management structures that must be established 

before the Bank Board of Directors rules on the project, especially the Project Coordination 

Team (ECP) and the recruitment or appointment of its members as well as the National Steering 

Committee (CNP). The project budget will be incorporated fully in the State budget and 

implemented following the simplified expenditure procedure. Project accounts will be kept with 

the SIGFIP (Integrated Public Finance Management System) software, which handles only the 

budgetary module. To have complete accounts bringing together budgetary, cost and general 

accounting modules, a private management software will be procured. Financial reports and 

statements will be published for the public as well as private systems. A procedures manual 

harmonizing public and private procedures will be prepared for the project’s management and 

financed by PPF funds.  

4.1.10 Disbursements. Project resources will be disbursed using the reimbursement, direct 

payment and revolving fund methods, pursuant to the provisions of the Bank’s Disbursement 

Manual. Four accounts will be opened in a bank acceptable to AfDB Group to receive ADF 

resources: a special account to receive revolving funds serving for the operation of the project 

coordination and three accounts to receive resources for the Value Chains Development Fund: 

(i) a dedicated account for the operations and operating expenses of this Fund; (ii) a 

“Refinancing Facility” account meant to refinance banks and project partner SFDs, and to 

guarantee loans granted to beneficiary SMEs; and (iii) an account meant for interest rate 

subsidies. These accounts have only one signatory, the public accountant who is personally 

responsible for funds entrusted to him. He/she must be sworn-in and pay a deposit in the public 

Treasury before assuming duty. Expenses linked to the services of consultants, contractors and 

suppliers will be settled by direct payment. Counterpart funds will be used to pay for expenses 

either by direct payment or by a project account opened for that purpose. 

4.1.11 Audit: An independent auditor will be recruited through competitive bidding for the 

annual audit of project accounts. He/she will be recruited based on terms of reference approved 

by the Bank for a maximum period of three years. The auditor’s continued services will be 

contingent on the approval of his/her first report. Audit reports must reach the Bank latest six 

(6) months after the close of the fiscal year. In parallel, the project is subject to control by the 

General Inspectorate of Finance (IGF) and verification by the Court of Auditors, as indicated in 

Decree No. 2015-475. 

4.2 Monitoring 

4.2.1 Project implementation will span five years from the second quarter of 2017. Once the 

project team is recruited, the Bank will organize the start-up mission to put in place all 

requirement for a rapid and efficient commencement of project activities. 

4.2.2 The project’s internal Monitoring/Evaluation Service (SSEI) will monitor the project 

internally at the physical and financial level, and by expenditure category as well as assess the 

project’s impact on beneficiaries and the environment based on relevant and jointly established 

indicators. It will be aligned on a geographic information system (GIS) included in the project’s 

ICT components. At start-up (PPF budget), SSEI will be supported by a consultant to set up the 

baseline situation and establish a monitoring/evaluation system, including verifiable indicators. 

The baseline situation study will include the gender profile in agriculture, to deepen knowledge 

of beneficiary groups especially with regard to socio-economic aspects (income, capital, 

agricultural activities). This system is expected to be functional latest six months following 



 

17 

project commencement. On that basis, the project will produce quarterly and annual progress 

reports indicating especially the implementation rates and outcomes of the different 

components, linked to the performance indicators of the logical framework. 

4.2.3 External monitoring/evaluation will be undertaken by the Directorate of Projects 

Evaluation (DEP), working closely with the directorates in charge of projects of technical 

ministries involved as well as the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). Half-yearly 

external monitoring/evaluation reports will seek to measure progress made, identify possible 

constraints and make recommendations to resolve problems encountered. DEP will involve 

technical directorates of ministries in external monitoring missions to consider particular 

technical problems and compliance with sector strategies. Considering the project’s linkages 

with ECOWAP, external monitoring/evaluation will ensure harmonization with indictors 

selected for PNIA. The project will place at the disposal of DEP, DPPF of MINADER, the 

Directorate of Public Debt and the directorates of technical ministries involved, the necessary 

means to enable them accomplish this mission. A mid-term review is planned to establish the 

interim implementation situation, ensure the overall good progress of the project and, if 

necessary, propose adjustments. A final joint evaluation is also programmed towards project 

completion to draw lessons and build on project achievements. 

4.2.4 The project implementation schedule is presented in Table 4.7 below.

4.3 Governance 

Under Pillar I of the Bank’s CSP 2013-2017, the Bank supports the connection of the Integrated 

Local Government Management System (SIGESCOD) to the Integrated Public Finance 

Management System and the Integrated Public Procurement Management System within the 

framework of the Economic and Financial Management Support Project (PAGEF 2017-2019). 

The aim is to reduce the risk of financial loss during the management of public finances and 

support the capacity building of actors of sector ministries and local governments. This project 

will also support local governance by better securing land tenure systems, establishing concerted 

systems to limit farmer/grazier conflicts, and strengthening the capacity of local communities 

and organs to manage infrastructure whose competencies are sometimes weak. The other 

measures adopted concern: (i) the conduct of annual financial audits; (ii) efficient coordination 

by the Project Coordination Team (ECP); and (iii) the conduct of at least two supervision 

missions per year. 

4.4 Sustainability 

4.4.1 The project aims to initiate truly sustainable development by placing local 

stakeholders, including farmers, at the heart of decision-making while also strengthening their 

capacity to assume new responsibilities. During PPF preparation and site identification studies, 

an intervention process was adopted governed by a number of eligibility criteria to ensure the 



 

18 

effective commitment of the farmers concerned and the absence of potential conflicts. The 

communities concerned will provide financial or in-kind contribution for all support 

infrastructure, based on good governance mechanisms in force. The project will accompany 

them to engage a process aimed at sustaining infrastructure put in place. They will be supported 

to strengthen their capacity at the technical and organizational level, which will create expertise 

and greater ownership at their level. In particular, committees will be created or revitalized at 

each of the sites to ensure sound management and regular maintenance of community 

infrastructure. Mayors will be involved and accompanied in the management of communal 

infrastructure (markets, slaughter areas, etc.). Private sector involvement in processing and 

marketing actions is also a guarantee of the sustainability of actions undertaken through value 

chain dynamics and actor networking. 

4.4.2 The issue of the sustainability of actions implemented, especially infrastructure 

maintenance and management, is a central concern in the project’s design. For each type of 

infrastructure, specific measures will be taken to ensure management and maintenance under 

good conditions: (i) the maintenance of rehabilitated rural roads is ensured by budgeting related 

works on counterpart funds (FER financing) and piloted programming by AGEROUTE (global 

agreement with 2PAIA-Bélier); (ii) gravity-based operation of rice cultivation works, limiting 

management and maintenance costs; (iii) involvement and training of local structures to manage 

markets with higher receipts due to increased activities and sensitization; (iv) training and 

revitalization of committees for the management of HVA systems and irrigation sites, including 

water rates based on recognized practices and activities; (v) support of settled young farmers 

with tracking of trading accounts etc. Regarding the conservation of the physical environment, 

targeted actions will not have negative effects on the environment, which will foster the 

sustainability of actions undertaken. 

4.5 Risk Management 

4.5.1 The main risks that might limit results and measures for mitigating them are as follows: 

climate change related risk: Bélier Region faces serious climatic impacts, including: (i) 

recurrent flooding; and (ii) drought and its repercussions on the farming calendar and choice of 

varieties. The project will undertake mitigation measures including: (a) structures that can resist 

high intensity swells; (b) promotion of varieties and practices suited to drought cycles; (c) the 

dissemination of knowledge of climate-related risks and data; and (d) sensitization and 

communication at the level of the population of zones concerned. 

4.5.2 Risk of land-related conflicts: To ensure non-discriminatory access to works 

undertaken (gravity-based irrigation works, lowlands, market gardens, stores, etc.), the project 

will support the process of social evaluation on all sites to be developed before any intervention 

is undertaken. On development sites with full water mastery and lowland sites, the project will 

finance the land security of sites to be developed. Capacity-building support will also be 

provided to communes for better dissemination of land transaction tools and issuance of 

exploitation certificates.  

4.5.3 Risk of transhumance-related conflicts: With regard to the prevention of 

transhumance-related conflicts, the project will support devolved structures and communes to 

accompany endogenous transhumance-related conflict management mechanisms by setting up 

consultative frameworks and drafting local agreements for natural resources management. Two 

pilot sites integrating structuring works will also be selected in the region. 

4.6 Knowledge Building 

Particularly through its development of the value chains component, 2PAI-Bélier will contribute 

to train different actors and disseminate new knowledge primarily to farmers, thanks to the 



 

19 

support and training offered by operators and technical services in advisory support, structuring 

and organization. It will come up with technical innovations based on research outcomes and 

also enable youths and women inclusively to develop technical and entrepreneurial capacity and 

settle on land equipped with infrastructure and modern means of operation. As part of training 

and settling of youths, the project will support agricultural training centres and INP-ESA by 

introducing new curricula and training modules to better respond to the requirements of 

agricultural entrepreneurship and promote the emergence of technological innovations. Lastly, 

the project will set up an integrated system for managing and sharing knowledge on project 

activities through the regular dissemination of knowledge and experience acquired on its 

website and that of MINADER.

PROJECT SUMMARY 

 

Project Overview: The Savannah Zone Agricultural Productivity Improvement Project 

(SAZAPIP) aims at transforming agricultural value chains for food and nutrition security, job 

and wealth creation in the Northern Savannah Zone of Ghana. The project will increase farmers’ 

food and nutrition security and incomes through increased agricultural productivity and 

diversification; and enhance the creation and strengthening of agribusinesses to increase 

incomes of actors along selected value chains on a sustainable basis. The project has four 

Components: (i) Crop Productivity Improvement; (ii) Value Chains & Agribusiness 

Development; (ii) Infrastructure Development; and (iii) Project Coordination, Management, 

Monitoring and Evaluation. The project will be implemented over a five-year period (2018 – 

2023) at a total cost of UA 40.38 million. 

 
Needs Assessment: The Savannah Zone holds major agricultural promise that when harnessed 

will transform the lives of the zone's inhabitants quite significantly, yet the zone constitutes the 

poorest part of the country with a poverty rate of over 40% which is about double the national 

average. The zone is characterized with relatively more challenging agro-ecological conditions, 

low socio-economic indicators and historical deficit in public investments in infrastructure and 

services. Development of this zone is perceived as a national imperative for Ghana’s balance 

of payments, macro-economic stability, economic growth, food and nutrition security, job 

creation and poverty reduction. 

 

Value Added for the African Development Bank: The proposed SAZAPIP will contribute 

towards the High 5 goals of the Bank Group. The project fits with the two key pillars of the 

draft Bank Group Country Strategy Paper (CSP) (2017-2021) for Ghana namely: (i) Agriculture 

Enhancing Inclusive Growth and Economic Development; and (ii) Support to Industrialization 

through Private Sector Development. The Bank Group has a comparative advantage in 

supporting the agriculture value chains development activities that will transform the 

impoverished rural areas of the northern part of the country into zones of economic prosperity 

drawing on lessons from experiences gained from previous projects financed by the Bank in 

Ghana. The project will also leverage on the complementary Ghana Incentive Based Risk 

Sharing for Agricultural Lending (GIRSAL) that is being established by the Bank in 

conjunction with the Bank of Ghana. It will also operationalise the activities of the TAAT 

framework and link up with TASI as a vehicle for attracting private sector investment in 

agriculture as well as the ongoing ENABLE Youth Program in the Bank funded Rural 

Enterprises Project (REP).  
 

Knowledge Management: Knowledge will be captured through the establishment of a 

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system by the project.  The M&E system will coordinate all 

results and measurement activities, ensure the quality control and provide the necessary 

capacity building. In using the performance indicators and targets specified in the results-based 

framework, special note would be taken of changes that reflect advancement towards the 

translation of outputs into development outcomes. Data for analysis will be captured from the 

M&E database, supervision missions, mid-term report, and periodic impact assessment and 

field exchange visits of the stakeholders. Knowledge will be generated by the pilot 

demonstration plots to form the basis for private sector investment in the agribusiness in the 

ecological zone as part of TASI. Knowledge could additionally be spread within the institution 

by showcasing the Project results using the Bank ICT infrastructure (Intranet, short 

documentaries on Bank website, etc.).

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF MANAGEMENT FOR THE PROPOSED 

ADF LOAN OF UA 27.86 MILLION TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA FOR THE 

FINANCING OF THE SAVANNAH ZONE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY 

IMPROVEMENT PROJECT  

 

Management submits the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of UA 27.86 

million to finance the Savannah Zone Agricultural Productivity Improvement Project in Ghana. 

I STRATEGIC THRUST & RATIONALE 

1.1.  Programme linkages with country strategy and objectives 

1.1.1 The Savannah Zone Agricultural Productivity Improvement Project (SAZAPIP) is 

designed within the context of the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda II” 

(GSGDA II). The underlying theme of the GSGDA II is socio-economic transformation, which 

involves a change in the structure and composition of the national output in ways that enhance 

broad-based, inclusive and sustainable growth. It stimulates the innovative process of 

production through skills and technological upgrading; enhancing the competitiveness of 

industry and trade; lifting workers from low-productive agriculture to higher productive 

activities; and putting the economy on a growth path that creates jobs, opens up decent work 

opportunities for all, alleviates poverty and reduces income and social inequalities.  

1.1.2 It is guided by country’s Food and Agriculture Sector Development Policy 

(FASDEP) which has the following as its pillars: (i) Food Security and Emergency 

Preparedness; (ii) Increased Growth in Incomes and Reduced Income Variability; (iii) Increased 

Competitiveness and Enhanced Integration into Domestic and International Markets;  (iv) 

Sustainable Management of Land and Environment; (v) Science and Technology Applied in 

Food and Agriculture Development; and (vi) Improved Institutional Coordination. The 

FASDEP anchors on sub-sector policies including the Crop Development Policy; Cocoa 

Strategy; Livestock Development Policy; Fisheries Policy and Policies for Services Delivery 

(Extension. Irrigation, Plant Protection, Agricultural Mechanization). 

1.1.3 The Government has targeted enhancing agricultural productivity and production 

through its Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ) Campaign. The major interventions under the 

PFJ are organized around the following five pillars: (i) Seed: The program will catalyse market-

led production of adequate quantities of quality seeds by private enterprises; (ii) Fertilizer: 

Private companies engaged in fertilizer production/blending and importation will be facilitated 

in meeting the fertilizer demands of the beneficiary farmers; (iii) Extension Services: In 

partnerships with the local governments and private inputs and service providers, the extension 

services will provide reliable and programmed technical assistance to beneficiaries; (iv) 

Marketing: It is envisaged that the facilitation of increased uptake of inputs will lead to 

increase in production of the targeted crops by the provision of storage warehouses; and (v) E-

Agriculture: The PFJ Campaign will profile the beneficiaries by e-registering them and 

developing a state-of-art information and communication technology (ICT) platform. 

1.1.4 While the PFJ Campaign is a nationwide program, the SAZAPIP will focus on three of 

the six agri-business clusters of the Northern Savannah Ecological Zone (NSEZ). The NSEZ 

constitutes the poorest part of the country with a poverty rate of over 40% which is about double 

the national average. The zone is characterized with relatively more challenging agro-ecological 

conditions, low socio-economic indicators and historical deficit in public investments in 

infrastructure and services. Development of this zone is perceived as a national imperative for 



 

2 

Ghana’s balance of payments, macro-economic stability, economic growth, food and nutrition 

security, job creation and poverty reduction.  

 

1.1.5 The Project is anchored in the PFJ Campaign of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture 

as well as the One District One Factory (1D1F) initiative of the Government of Ghana. The PFJ 

Campaign seeks to enhance agricultural production while the 1D1F looks at agro-industrial 

development aspects of the project. The Project will target four (i, ii, iv and v) of the above 

mentioned pillars and thereby contribute to the High-5 priorities that are crucial for accelerating 

Africa’s economic transformation: Feed Africa; Industrialize Africa; and Improve the quality 

of life for the people of Africa. It will particularly contribute to the Feed Africa priority which 

focuses on transformation, scaling up agriculture as a business through value addition, led by 

the private sector and enabled by the Government. It will concentrate on one of the eight 

identified Priority Intervention Areas (PIA) under TAAT - Transforming African Savannahs into 

breadbaskets and promote four of the 18 identified priority commodity value chains – rice, 

maize, soybean and vegetables. In line with the Feed Africa Strategy’s focus on priority value 

chains, the project will contribute towards the Transformation of the African Savannah 

Initiative (TASI) by serving as a precursor pilot project for proven technologies and knowledge. 

Details of TASI are in Section C6 of the Technical Annexes.  

 

1.1.6 The Bank has a comparative advantage in supporting the agriculture value chains 

development activities that will transform the impoverished rural areas of the northern part of 

the country into zones of economic prosperity with attendant benefits of employment and social 

development. This Project will achieve this by creating strategic, competitive agribusinesses 

around rice, maize, soybean and vegetable value chains that are widely produced in the northern 

parts of the country. The Project will consolidate the gains made through various previous Bank 

interventions such as the Northern Rural Growth Programme (NRGP), Fufulso-Sawla and 

Techiman - Kintampo Roads Project; optimise on the usage of infrastructure that were 

constructed in those interventions; and leverage on private sector investment to the 

establishment of a rice processing zone around Tamale and commercial farming in the Northern 

Savanna – the RMG projects in Yagaba and Babato.  

 

1.1.7 SAZAPIP is aligned to 2012-2017 Ghana Country Strategy Paper (CSP) which has been 

extended to December 2018. The strategy has two pillars namely: (i) Support for infrastructure 

development; and (ii) Support for improved governance and accountability. During the CSP 

extension period, the Bank will focus on developing and supporting priority skills for industry, 

improving access to sanitation and providing diverse opportunities for rural employment and 

income generation for a more equitable growth. Over the CSP extension period, the Bank will 

meet this objective through the implementation of the Development of Skills for Industry 

Project, and the Greater Accra Sustainable Sanitation and Livelihoods Improvement Project. 

Other projects that are envisaged to support this objective include: the Savannah Zone 

Agriculture Productivity Improvement Project and the Establishment of Ghana Incentive-Based 

Risk Sharing for Agriculture Lending.  

1.2.  Rationale for Bank’s involvement 

1.2.1 The project has a great potential in contributing to the twin objectives of the Bank’s 10-

Year Strategy (TYS). It contributes to inclusive growth across geographical locations, age and 

gender in that the major interventions of the project are concentrated in commodity value chain 

intervention in the NSEZ where poverty is highest in the country and youth and women agri-

preneurs are targeted by the project. 



 

3 

1.2.2 The project will enhance agriculture transformation through increased productivity of 

rice, maize, soybean and vegetables; and investment in both hard infrastructure (seed processing 

and storage, irrigation, produce warehouses and feeder roads); as well as soft infrastructure 

(farmer e-registration and e-agriculture). The project will also leverage on the complementary 

innovative agricultural financing mechanisms (the Ghana Incentive Based Risk Sharing for 

Agricultural Lending (GIRSAL) that is being established with the assistance of the Bank in 

conjunction with the Bank of Ghana. It will also operationalise the activities of the TAAT 

framework and link up with TASI as a vehicle for attracting private sector investment in 

agriculture in the savannah zone of Ghana. Furthermore, the project will provide 

entrepreneurship and business management training to value chain actors in order for them to 

be eligible to assess resources in the ongoing ENABLE Youth Program in the Bank funded 

Rural Enterprises Project (REP).  

1.3. Donors’ coordination 

1.3.1 The key development partners that are active in the sector are: L'Agence française de 

développement (AFD); Department for International Development (DFID); Global Affairs 

Canada; European Union; German Dev. Co-op (KfW Development Bank and GiZ); 

Netherlands Embassy; Australian High Commission; JICA; USAID and World Bank; UN 

Agencies (IFAD, FAO and WFP). Others are IFPRI, AGRA and international NGOs such as 

SNV and Catholic Relief Services. Donor activities cuts across ranges mostly targets various 

commodity value chains development, productivity enhancement, agricultural production and 

processing infrastructure development, mechanization, irrigation, sustainable land 

management, climate change adaptation and mitigation, nutrition, food safety, MSE and 

agribusiness development, access to finance, access to land and ICT for agriculture.  

 

1.3.2 Donor coordination mechanisms for the Agriculture Sector in Ghana are effective. 

Coordination under the Agriculture Sector Working Group (ASWG) began in 2002 and 

provides a platform for sharing information on ongoing and planned future activities with the 

aim of harmonizing interventions. The group holds annual joint sector reviews where donors, 

Government, implementation partners, civil society organizations (CSOs), and the private 

sector review the performance of the sector to inform planning and decision making. The 

ASWG is an open group of donors; quasi donors; implementers including NGOs, CSOs, private 

sector, etc.; and Government Ministries.  

 

1.3.3 Key on-going/pipeline interventions by donors include a EUR160 million support for 

productive investment for sustainable agriculture development capacity building of 

decentralized institutions and community development in the part of the SADA Zone. The 

Government of Canada is also supporting the sector with a CAD125 million facility for 

Modernizing Agriculture in Ghana (MAG). IFAD has provided USD71.60 million as loan for 

sustainable rural poverty reduction in rural areas and a grant of USD10.0 million to mitigate 

the effects of climate change. The Bank has successfully co-financed projects in the sector with 

other donors. Notable among these is the just ended Northern Rural Growth Program and the 

on-going Rural Enterprises Program which were/are both co-financed with IFAD. A matrix of 

interventions by donors is presented in Annex A1 of the Technical Annexes. The coordination 

of aid through the ASWG is enhancing aid effectiveness through harmonization and alignment 

of development partner support.

II PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

2.1 Project Objectives 

2.1.1 Project development goal: The development objective of the project is to transform 

agricultural value chains for food and nutrition security, job and wealth creation.  

 

2.1.2 Specific project objectives: To increase farmers’ food and nutrition security and 

incomes through increased agricultural productivity and diversification; and enhance the 

creation and strengthening of agribusinesses to increase incomes of actors along selected value 

chains on a sustainable basis. 

 

Project Components 

 

2.1.3 The project will have four Components. (i) Crop Productivity Improvement; (ii) Value 

Chains & Agribusiness Development; (ii) Infrastructure Development; and (iii) Project 

Coordination, Management, Monitoring and Evaluation. The summary of activities are 

indicated in Table 2.1 below. 

 

Component 1 – Crop Productivity Improvement: This component will seek to increase the crop 

productivity through the use of improved and more nutritious seed varieties. The project will 

assist rice, maize, soybean and vegetable farmers to adopt productivity– improving 

technologies such as soil fertility interventions, mechanization, and extension services. 

Nutrition promotion activities will be implemented in order to promote dietary diversity, and 

in particular to increase consumption of vegetables in the project area. Infrastructure of the 

decrepit national seed production centers will be renovated, equipped with modern machinery 

and supported to ensure national self-sufficiency in breeder, foundation and certified seeds 

production for strategic commodities. Essential expected outcomes under this component will 

be disseminating technologies selected under the Technologies for African Agricultural 

Transformation (TAAT) for the target commodities. These technologies will be complemented 

by other proven technologies within the TASI framework. Demonstration of high gross margin 

crop production technology and conservation agriculture will also be carried out at four selected 

locations. Private and public sector extension agents, commercial farmers, and young farmers 

will also be trained in the new maize and soybean production technologies. 

 

Component 2: Value Chain and Agribusiness Development: The objective of this component 

is to set up sustainable agribusinesses along the commodity value chains by entrepreneurship 

training to value chain actors. It will further strengthen the local governance structures such as 

the District Value Chain Committees (DVCCs), which is an innovative concept that links 

farmers to value chain’s actors to more ably participate in the ownership and management of 

facilities that will be set up. It will orchestrate linkages to other flagship programmes of the 

Bank particularly the on-going ENABLE Youth Program in the Rural Enterprises Program and 

the up-coming Risk Sharing Facility (RSF) through Ghana Incentive Based Risk Sharing for 

Agricultural Lending (GIRSAL and facilitation of the establishment of an Innovation Platform.  

This component will ultimately contribute to the achievement of the Government flagship 

program of 1D1F as it will promote private sector investments in the Project operational area. 

 

Component 3:  The infrastructure development component will provide for both hard and soft 

infrastructure. The hard infrastructure will include: (i) Development of Transport Infrastructure 

(feeder roads, farm-tracks and stock routes); (ii) Rehabilitation of irrigation canals; (iii) 

Development of Processing & Marketing Infrastructure especially as corporate rural 



 

5 

enterprises; and (iv) Rehabilitation of warehouses. The soft infrastructure will leverage on on-

going e-agriculture activities in the sector to consolidate the various registration of farmers into 

an agriculture sector database for input supply system. 

 

Component 4: The Project Management and Co-ordination will be responsible for the day to 

day management of the project. It will also be responsible for Monitoring and Evaluation 

(M&E), gender equality and women’s empowerment and implementation of the Project 

Environmental and Social Management Plan.

Component 2: 

Value Chain and 

Agribusiness 

Development  

3 (7.4%) The objective of this component is to set up sustainable agribusinesses 

along the rice value chains. This component will: 

- Strengthen the local governance structures (DVCCs) to more ably 
participate in the ownership and management of facilities will be set 

up. 

- register farmers within the project area on the e-registration platform 
and develop database for input supply system 

- Support the establishment of an Innovation Platform, which will work 
to address policy, infrastructure, fiscal and land tenure bottlenecks in 

order to facilitate the flow of private capital into game changing 

agribusiness investments in the region.  

- Provide incentives to crowd in private investments in project area to 
harness the business opportunities enabled through the public 

investments in the area through this and other projects including 

innovative financing (e.g. GIRSAL), infrastructure development 

(roads, power, irrigation etc.), land tenure reforms and others.

This is an investment project financed with an ADF loan. 

2.4  Programme cost and financing arrangements 

2.4.1 The total cost of the project is estimated at UA40.38 million, net of taxes, and based on 

2017 prices, comprising of UA27.56 million (68%) of the total cost in foreign cost, and 

UA12.81 million (30%) in local cost. The total cost is inclusive of physical and price 

contingencies estimated at average rates of 15% and 2.5%, respectively.  

 

2.4.2 The project cost of UA40.21 million will be part financed by an ADF loan of UA27.86 

million (69% of project costs) covering all major activities including rehabilitation and 

construction of infrastructure. The Government of Ghana will contribute UA6.5 million (16.1% 

of project costs) through the provision of office space and allied facilities, payment of salaries 

of Government staff attached to the project, and provision of tractors and subsidies on fertilizers 

and seeds. The farmer beneficiaries’ contribution of UA6.0 million (14.9% of project cost) will 

be towards the payment for inputs delivered in the Government subsidy scheme. The summary 

of estimated costs by component and category of expenditure are presented in Tables 2.3 and 

2.4 below.

Intervening in other 

value chains including 

livestock. 

Livestock is one of the key value chains that was identified 

in five of the six agribusiness zones. The per-capita 

consumption meat has almost doubled in past 15 years. 

The growth in meat production however lags far behind 

the growth in consumption of meat hence large volumes of 

imported meat.. Livestock development integrates well 

with crops development especially with crops such as 

soybean and maize which are used for livestock feed in 

semi-intensive and intensive production systems 

Budgetary allocation for 

the project cannot 

accommodate the livestock 

intervention. Furthermore, 

livestock is yet to be 

considered a priority 

commodity under the 

Planting for Food and Jobs.

2.4.4 Justification for Local Costs Financing: The ADF loan of UA 27.86 million will 

finance 100% of Works; 55% of Goods and Materials; 100% of Services; and 68% of recurrent 

costs. The loan will finance 67% of foreign costs and 72% of local costs. The Government of 

Ghana does not have the capacity to finance all local costs of the project as a result of the current 

economic hardship and fiscal deficit facing the country. Consequently, local costs have been 

factored into AfDB financing in order not to delay implementation of activities.   

2.5 Programme’s target area and population 

The Project will be implemented in three agribusiness zones (1, 2 & 5) defined by SADA 

covering the following towns: Savelugu-Nanton (Nasia/Nabogu); Builsa South 

(Fumbisi/Gbedembilisi); Tolon (Golinga); Kumbungu (Bontanga); West Gonja (Nabori, 

Busumu); and West Mamprusi (Walewale). Additionally, four seed centres at Winneba, Ho, 

Kumasi and Tamale would be rehabilitated. The direct beneficiaries are about 50,000 

economically active smallholders living in the selected agro-processing zones; and the 

processing firms that serve as a direct market for the farmers. The indirect beneficiaries include 

the entire population (consumers) that will benefit from the availability of food and business 

associations who provide services to the producers and processors. This number is expected to 

increase significantly when other economically active value chain entrepreneurs get involved 

in the Project. Among the target group, women and youth play a major role in crop production, 

processing, small enterprises operation and marketing. About 50% of beneficiaries (women) 

will be specifically targeted in project activities and to reap benefits. 

2.6 Participatory process for programme identification, design and implementation 

The preparation mission had a general consultation and technical working sessions with 

Government personnel and key stakeholder groups in agriculture including development 

partners. The outcome of the discussions was the development of a logical framework for the 

Project and the preparation report that is forming the basis for the appraisal report. Stakeholders 

will also be consulted during the preparation of the ESMF and site specific ESMPs and their 

inputs will be taken into consideration during planning, design and implementation. A 

stakeholder engagement plan will be developed for the implementation phase of the project. 

2.7 Bank Group experience, lessons reflected in the programme design 

2.7.1 As at 30 December 2016, the overall performance of the Bank’s portfolio in Ghana was 

rated satisfactory, with an overall rating of 3.0 on a scale of 1 to 4, with 4 being highly 
satisfactory. The portfolio was rated 2.9 for implementation progress, and 3.4 for development 

outcome. The portfolio has six (6) project at risk, of which three projects (i) Rural Enterprise 

Programme III; (ii) Development of Skills for Industry (DSIP), and (iii) the Electricity 
Distribution Systems Reinforcement are experiencing slow implementation. The Greater Accra 

Sustainable Sanitation and Livelihoods Improvement Project experienced signature delays, 
which have now been surmounted with the signing of the loan in September 2017. The Ghana 



 

10 

Country Office (COGH) improved in most of the key performance indicators during the period 
2013 to 2017. Average time lapse between approval and first disbursement has reduced to an 

all-time low of 5.4 months compared to 18 months in 2015. The pace of implementation of the 
lending program and portfolio was adversely impacted by Government’s imposition of a 

moratorium on new loans, between 2013 and 2015, as part of its debt management strategy. 

This moratorium contributed to the drop in the disbursement ratio from 28% in 2015 to 18% in 
2016. Disbursement is now on the upward path, at 22.4% as at August 2017. Further details are 

provided in Annex B1.2 of the Technical annexes. 

 

2.7.2 The lessons learnt from the Bank’s operations in the country has enhanced project 

design for implementation efficiency and sustainability. For example the CSPE (2002-2015) 

indicated that the sustainability of agriculture sector projects was limited by project design 

flaws, particularly the lack of clear management plans for the maintenance of key assets such 

as pack houses and markets. This flaw has been addressed in this project by the new approaches 

which considers intervening to fill the gaps in the operations of actors along the value chains of 

interest as against the concentration of the activities supported by the program around just the 

farmers. The project designs also builds on lessons learnt form the NRGP in the areas of 

Appropriate exit strategy for project implementing support agencies; Readiness of project for 

implementation at design; and Matching grants. Specifically, based on the experiences of this 

project and others, APIP is designed to support existing government institutions such as the 

CSIR-SARI, SRI to strengthen their delivery of services that are under their mandate such as 

breeder and foundation seed production; and soil nutrient analysis as against using NGOs or 

private sector. It is also designed to leverage on private sector investment on the ground, such 

as existing AMSECs and AVNASH and catalyse their activities (e.g. mechanization and 

primary processing), without creating dependency of the project funds. APIP has already 

identified the major infrastructure for which feasibilities had already been done including 

rehabilitation works on the existing Golinga and Botanga Irrigation Schemes; improvement of 

water management infrastructure for selected flood recession schemes, rehabilitation of 12 

warehouses have all be identified. APIP is not introducing any one fit all matching grant 

program. It will leverage on the government’s own input and mechanization support program 

in which case mechanized service provides are able to acquire machinery / equipment from the 

government with a concessionary repayment arrangement including a grant element.  In the 

cases of non-existing technologies, particularly for mechanization such as using laser levellers, 

mouldboard plough, rice transplanters etc. the project will provide for full grants to the 

mechanization service providers to acquire the technology and promote them 

2.8 Key performance indicators 

The overall impact of the SAZAPIP include improved food and nutrition security, job creation 

and wealth creation for commodity value chain actors. Through improved agricultural 

production, productivity and market linkages, about 20,000 jobs will be created, of which 

women and youths account for about 60%, along the value chains. It is envisaged that there will 

be income increase by 25% along the value chains and employment of women and youth in the 

agriculture sector. The crowding in of private sector investment in terms of investment volume 

as a result of the demonstration of improved technologies and production systems will be a key 

indicator of success.

III PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1. Financial and economic performance 

3.1.1 A financial assessment of the project was undertaken using activity models, and on the 

basis of prevailing market prices. The key assumptions underlying the analyses include: (i) 

50,000 farmers being actively engaged in farming at full capacity of the project; (ii) additional 

25% increase in income will be earned under the project, (iii) farmers will adopt the improved 

seed varieties (iii) a 20-year time period was used to measure the incremental benefits from the 

project; (iv) the opportunity cost of capital (OCC) used for discounting future benefits was 

estimated to be 12%. For the economic analysis, (v) hired labour value was adjusted by a 

conversion factor of 0.75; (vi) the rehabilitation of the seed system will ensure national quality 

seed supply. These analyses were carried-out with financial and economic costs generated using 

Costab 32. Summary of financial and economic analysis is in Annex VII and further elaborated 

in Annex B6 in Volume II of the appraisal report. The project is expected generate the following 

benefits: (i) increase in food production; (ii) increased private sector investment; (iii) improved 

seed production and storage; (iv) improve average household income; (v) provide employment 

for 50,000 farmers and entrepreneurs; and (vi) enhanced crop nutrition. 

 

 Table 3.1: key economic and financial figures 
 

FIRR : 23%    NPV (base case) is USD   2,333,835.26   

EIRR : 28%    NPV (base case)  is USD  2,683,910.55      

   NB: detailed calculations are available in Annex B7 

 

3.1.2 Financial analysis 

 

Based on the above assumptions, the financial analysis generated Net Present Value (NPV) of 

USD2,333,835.26 and financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of 23%, as captured in the 

technical annexes (B6). Based on the above analysis, the project is deemed financially feasible. 

The FIRR of 23% is higher than the opportunity cost of capital (12%). 

 

3.1.4 Economic analysis 

 

The economic analysis was conducted using the same approach as the financial analysis, on the 

basis of shadow prices of tradable goods, producer (farm gate) prices and total cost of project. 

In addition, other indirect benefits were also expected, such as, reduction in post-harvest losses; 

provision of mechanic service centre for agro equipment, reliable soil information system for 

fertilizer blends, efficient input distribution system through the farmer database system and 

lower cost of transportation of goods and services. However, these additional benefits were 

difficult to adequately value in monetary terms due to the limited scope of this report. In these 

conditions, the economic analysis yielded an NPV of USD2,683,910.55 and the economic 

internal rate of return (EIRR) of 28% as captured in the technical annexes. 

3.2. Environmental and social impacts 

3.2.1 Environment  

 

3.2.1.1 The Ministry of Food and Agriculture, has made efforts to ensure sustainable land and 

environmental management within the sector through implementation of several policies and 

programmes and these include: Food and Agriculture Sector Development Policy (FASDEP II) 



 

12 

and an Agricultural Sustainable Land Management Strategy and Action Plan was developed to 

operationalize the policy objective. MoFA works in collaboration EPA at all levels to ensure 

that environmental sustainability policy and programmes are implemented. The proposed 

Savannah Zone Agricultural Productivity Improvement Project is classified as a Category 2 

because the project activities are expected to have impacts that can be avoided and minimised 

and will mostly be site-specific environmental and social impacts. The Project also falls under 

Schedule 2 of the Environmental Assessment Regulations 1999 LI 1652 of the Ghana 

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The project is expected to finance construction and 

rehabilitation of small irrigation schemes, processing, marketing and storage facilities as well 

as support activities for increased production and commercialization. The project’s precise 

location, scope and scale of the project interventions will not be known before project 

implementation; hence, an overarching environmental and social management framework 

(ESMF) needs to be developed to provide the framework for managing the environment and 

social risks/issues of the project. This will guide the preparation of environmental and social 

impact assessment (ESIA) and development of site specific ESMP during project 

implementation.  

 

3.2.1.2 The anticipated negative impacts are those associated with the construction and/or 

rehabilitation works and agricultural production and value-chain development activities and 

include:  (i) loss of vegetation cover and habitat fragmentation due to site clearing (ii) land 

degradation, soil erosion, and pollution (iii) degradation of water resources through siltation 

and pollution (iv) disruption of water flows and hydrologic cycle which may impact activities 

of other water users, (v) noise, vibration and emissions from construction works and operation 

of machinery that may impair air quality and induce health implications, (vi) increased use of 

agrochemicals including pesticides and fertilizers that may have impacts on human health and 

biodiversity (vii) solid and liquid wastes generated from processing and marketing facilities 

(viii) increase in bush fires through the slush and burn traditional agricultural systems; (ix) 

climate risk impacts of GHG emissions and cumulative impacts of flooding if infrastructure is 

not well designed (x) increase in public health concerns (vector borne diseases, HIV/AIDs and 

other STDs) due to creation of vector habitats such as stagnant waters and influx of workers in 

project site areas and increased land conflicts due to commercialization, most lands are 

customary. The project is not expected to have land acquisition because the infrastructure 

development will be done on existing irrigation schemes and feeder roads with existing right of 

way. During operation phase, agriculture activities of value chain actors may lead to (i) 

increased use of agrochemicals including pesticides and fertilizers, which may contribute to 

soil and water (surface and groundwater) contamination, and increase health-risks of people 

exposed to pesticides, (ii) maintenance of irrigation infrastructure can generate dredged 

materials and waste and effluents from processing and marketing facilities can result in soil and 

water contamination when not properly disposed of. These impacts are mostly site specific and 

can be readily managed with the application of well-defined measures elaborated in site-specific 

ESIAs/ESMPs such as (i) restricting clearance of vegetation to construction and farming areas 

and revegetation by planting of trees; (ii) rehabilitation and filling of the exposed or excavated 

soil soon after completion of works and avoiding or minimizing compaction of soils, (ii) 

ensuring environmental flow for rivers/lakes, (iii) establishing sustainable water management 

and flood mitigation systems, and (iv) reduction of GHG emissions by ensuring well serviced 

machinery is used and proper processing facilities waste management; (v) capacity building of 

value chain actors to promote good agriculture and sustainable environment and land 

management practices (vi) use of improved agriculture technologies such as integrated soil 

fertility management (ISFM), integrated pest management (IPM) and Waste-to Energy; (vii) 

using lessons learned from similar projects. In addition, the project will ensure that institutional 



 

13 

and technical capacity that currently exist within MoFA is strengthened by having an 

Environmental Safeguard specialist in the Program Management Unit and training of 

Environmental Desk Officers at the local level to ensure effective site specific ESMP 

development, implementation and monitoring/reporting.  

 

3.2.1.3 Ghana SAZAPIP will generate significant positive impacts including (i) improved 

production, and competitiveness of selected agriculture commodities that will contribute to 

increased income opportunities for value chain actors including vulnerable groups, and support 

the local economy of the northern regions of Ghana; (ii) improved access to irrigation that will 

foster water management and reduce the vulnerability of farmers to precarious weather 

conditions and ensure all year round agriculture activities; (iii) improved agronomic practices 

and technologies for selected crops and improved varieties that are adapted to different climatic 

conditions; and (iv) improved agricultural production, productivity and market linkages that 

will foster job creation along the value chains. 

  

3.2.2  Climate change 

 

3.2.2.1 Ghanaian agriculture and food systems are climate dependent and recognized as one of 

the most vulnerable sectors to climate change. Indications are that the Northern Region of 

Ghana is currently experiencing seasonal variability of climate and rainfall. Consultations with 

MoFA and EPA indicated that the region is susceptible to flooding and drought that are 

unpredictable. The current increase in rain intensity is aggravating flooding events causing 

riverbank erosion, saltwater intrusion, infrastructure damages, crop failure, fisheries 

destruction, and loss of biodiversity. This has significant implications on livelihoods of 

agricultural communities who are mostly dependent of rain fed agriculture. Recommendations 

were made to incorporate climate risk mitigation and management strategies in the project 

design. 

 

3.2.2.2 The project will mainstream climate risk mitigation and adaptation activities in the 

project design and implementation that will focus on reducing the dependency on rainfall for 

agricultural activities as well as protect ecosystems at risk from other natural or anthropogenic 

hazards that accompany floods, drought and other land use changes.  The program will explore 

climate change adaptation technologies for agriculture consistent with priorities established in 

Ghana’s National Adaptation Program for Action (NAPA), Climate Change Policy, and the 

MoFA’s National Climate Smart Agriculture and Food Security Action Plan (2016-2020). This 

will ensure that the project facilitates and promotes greater resilience and adaptation to climate 

change by promoting climate smart agriculture through use of improved agriculture 

technologies and conservation agriculture.  

 

3.2.3 Social Impact and Nutrition 

 

According to the most recent data in the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), 

the prevalence of stunting is significantly higher in the Northern Region, with 33% stunting in 

children under five as compared to the national prevalence of 19%. Also the prevalence of 

anaemia in children under five is very high (82.1%). The Project will contribute to increased 

dietary diversity among households, and especially among women and children, in the Northern 

and Upper East regions. The actions envisaged include: (i) community sensitization on good 

nutrition and hygiene practices, and enhanced management of acute malnutrition, through 

strengthening of the Community Health Workers system; (ii) equipment of health facilities with 

materials for anthropometric measurements where there is an identified need (based on 



 

14 

assessment by Ghana Health Services); (iii) linkage of small holder farmers to the Ghana School 

Feeding Programme and (iv) nutrition and hygiene education in schools, complemented by fruit 

tree planting and school gardens. To link the School Feeding Programme to the smallholder 

farmers benefiting from the project, agriculture extension officers will be involved, who will 

also be engaged in the school gardens and fruit tree planting. In order to accommodate all these 

activities, a total of UA3 million will be earmarked for the support to the Community Health 

Workers system, the provision of equipment to health centres, and the nutrition and hygiene 

education in schools, complemented by fruit tree planting and school gardens. Part of the budget 

will also be used to support the cost of a representative Food Security and Nutrition Survey to 

support the M&E component of the Project and evaluate impact in terms of household dietary 

diversity at district levels.  

 

3.2.4 Gender Aspects 

 

3.2.4.1 In Ghana, women constitute 52% of the national Agricultural labour force, contribute 

46% to the total GDP and also produce 70% of subsistence crops (MOFA, 2002). In the SADA 

zone, where the project will be implemented, women play a major role in farming and food 

processing. Women are engaged in planting, weeding, harvesting, processing and marketing of 

agricultural produce in the region. Women are involved in the agricultural processing and 

contribute at more than 70% of agriculture transformation. The gender analysis of the 

agriculture sector in the area revealed the gender gaps along the value chain, with women in a 

disadvantaged side. Most of the gender gaps are outlined in  access to land and farming 

equipment’s, access to extension services delivery, access to certified seeds supply, fertilizer 

and crop protection materials, access to agricultural technologies, agriculture processing, access 

to credit and financial services. The Project will contribute to implement the Gender and 

agriculture Strategy by empowering women in the agriculture production. 

 

3.2.4.2 To address the identified gender gaps, the project will implement specific activities and 

put in place measures to uplift the conditions of women in the agriculture value chain, as 

follows: i) Engage with the traditional authorities and family heads to ensure land security for 

women in the project; ii) Ensure that equipment is easy to use and woman-friendly; iii) Ensure 

that women have equal access to improved inputs; iv) Train women and men on safe storage 

options for their produce and utilization of fertilizers; (v) ensure that women have equal access 

to marketing networks; and vi) Organize training for women in the areas of improved 

production, business management, financial literacy, packaging, leadership and decision 

making; good nutrition especially to pregnant women and under five-year children; and (vi) 

organise sensitizations on women’s rights and access to land. The total budget allocated to 

gender equality promotion and nutrition is around UA I million.  

 

3.2.5 Involuntary Resettlement 

 

There is no involuntary resettlement or land acquisition or any loss, by the population, of 

property, sources of income and livelihoods envisioned within the implementation of the 

Project activities. The project interventions will be implemented on existing agricultural 

systems but if any loss occurs it will be compensated based on AfDB requirements.  

 

 

 

 

 



 

15 

IV IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1. Implementation arrangements 

4.1.1 The Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) is the Executing Agency of the 

Savannah Zone Agricultural Productivity Improvement Project (SAZAPIP). A National Project 

Steering Committee (NPSC) will be constituted chaired by the Hon. Minister of MOFA or his 

representative, to provide strategic direction and oversight guidance to the project. To ensure 

effective project coordination and monitoring, the day-to-day project administration will be 

managed by a Project Coordination and Management Unit (PCMU) within MOFA, under the 

direct supervision of the Chief Director. The PCMU will be headed by a Project Coordinator 

who will report to the Chief Director, and also to the Northern Regional Director of Agriculture. 

The Ministry had used a similar arrangement to successfully implement Bank financed projects 

such as the Northern Rural Growth Program (NRGP), Export Marketing and Quality Awareness 

Project (EMQAP), and Afram Plains District Agricultural Development Project (APDADP). 

The Ministry is thus familiar with the Bunk’s financial management rules, procurement 

requirements and disbursements procedures. MOFA is already connected to the government 

integrated financial information management system (GIFMIS), although the system is yet to 

be fully deployed for all projects. Thus, the PCMU of the proposed project will adopt the Sun 

Accounting software of the just completed NRGP for financial accounting and reporting, and 

migrate to the GIFMIS when the system is fully deployed to projects.  
  
4.1.2 The PCMU staff will be competitively recruited by MOFA and located in the office 

premises of the Regional Department of Agriculture at Tamale. The staff requirement will 

include: the Project Coordinator, a Financial Controller, an Accounts Officer, Agronomist, a 

Monitoring and Evaluation Specialists, an Agribusiness specialist, an Agricultural Engineer and 

a Procurement Specialist. The services of other experts such as Irrigation specialist, Gender and 

Nutrition specialist and Environmental specialist will be drawn from regional government 

institutions. For implementation of nutrition related activities, the PCMU will collaborate with 

other Government stakeholders including the Ghana Health Services, the Ghana School 

Feeding Program and the Ghana Education Regional Offices. SADA will play an active role in 

work activity planning, implementation monitoring and also attracting investors to collaborate 

with the Project. Relevant government agencies such as Projects Coordination Unit, Crop 

Services Directorate, Agricultural Engineering Services Directorate (AESD), Ghana Irrigation 

Development Authority (GIDA), Plant Protection and Regulatory Services Directorate 

(PPRSD), Ghana Grains and Legumes Development Board (GLDB), Environmental Protection 

Authority and Ministry of Trade Industry (MoTI) will be supported to conduct macro-

monitoring of the project’s activities.  
 

4.1.3 A National Project Steering Committee (NPSC) will be established to provide 

strategic policy direction and oversight guidance for the project implementation. Its core 

activities shall include implementation of program strategy, oversee planning, review progress 

and impact, review/ approval of annual work plans and budgets as well as ensuring effective 

linkages with related programs. The NPSC membership would include: (i) one representative 

each from the relevant ministries (MOFA, MOTI MOF, MLGRD, MORH); (ii) one 

representative from selected public-sector agencies and institutions (BoG, DFR, EPA, SADA); 

(iii) three representatives from the Farmer Based Organizations; (v) three representatives from 

large-scale private sector traders/processors; and (vi) four representative from private investors 

and management firms of commodity chains facilities. NPSC meetings would be chaired by the 

Hon. Minister of MOFA or his designated representative, with the Project Coordinator as 

secretary. The NPSC would meet at least twice a year. Costs related to the meetings of the 

NPSC will be financed from ADF loan. 



 

16 

 

Procurement arrangements 
 

4.1.4 “Procurement of goods (including non-consultancy services), works and the acquisition 

of consulting services, financed by the Bank for the project, will be carried out in accordance 

with the “Procurement Policy and Methodology for Bank Group Funded Operations” (BPM), 

dated October 2015 and following the provisions stated in the Financing Agreement. 

Specifically, Procurement would be carried out following: 

 

4.1.5 Borrower Procurement System (BPS): Procurement through Open competitive Bidding 

National (OCBN) procedures will be carried out using BPS comprising its Laws and 

Regulations (Ghana Public Procurement Act, 2003 (Act 663), as amended Act, 2016 (Act 914) 

using the national Standard Solicitation Documents (SSDs) agreed during project negotiations” 

for various group of transactions to be entailed under the project, detailed in annex B 5.1 and 

the provisions stipulated in the Financing Agreement.  

 

4.1.6 Bank Procurement Policy and Methodology (BPM): Bank standard PMPs, using the 

relevant Bank Standard Solicitation Documents (SDDs), will be used for Open Competitive 

Bidding International (OCBI) contracts for both goods and works and Acquisition of 

Consulting Services as indicated in the Technical Annex B5, Para. B.5.3.2.  

 

4.1.7 Procurement Risks and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): the assessment of procurement 

risks at the Country, Sector, and Project levels and of procurement capacity at the Executing 

Agency (EA), were undertaken for the project and the output have informed the decisions on 

the procurement regimes (BPS and Banks PMP) being used for specific transactions or groups 

of similar transactions under the project. The appropriate risks mitigation measures have been 

included in the procurement PRCA action plan proposed in Annex B5, Para 5.3.2. The project 

activities derived from these components has informed the procurement risk and capacity 

assessment as well as the market analysis based on which the procurement strategy of the 

project has been developed. In addition some of the identified activities will require that MoUs 

are adopted to engage the services of some of the project partners including research institutions 

and the details of these arrangements are clearly defined in the technical annexes, B5. 

 

 Financial management and disbursement arrangements  

 

4.1.8 The Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) through its Project Coordination and 

Management Unit model will be directly responsible for the financial management 

arrangements of the project. The Project financial management will be headed by the FMS, 

who shall be a seasoned chartered accountant with hands-on experience on AfDB FM rules and 

procedures, assisted by an experienced Accounts Officer and Accounts Assistant/ Clerk. MOFA 

has not identified qualified accountants from within its ranks that can fill the top project FM 

positions, and would thus be expected to competitively fill the FMS and Accounts Officer 

positions. Both persons will be required to be proficient in the use of Sun Accounting Software 

and the practical application of IPSAS Cash Basis of Accounting. The Accounts Assistant 

position shall however be deployed from existing MOFA staff for staff capacity building and 

knowledge transfer purposes. In harmony with Government of Ghana (GoG) accounting 

standards and practices within MOFA, the project shall adopt the IPSAS Cash Basis for 

financial reporting.  

4.1.9 In terms of information flow, the FMS will report to the PC and to the Finance Director 

of MOFA (to ensure project results are correctly included in the overall consolidated accounts 



 

17 

of the Ministry). The FMS will be required to produce quarterly unaudited interim financial 

reports (IFRs) and annual financial reports in accordance with IPSAS Cash Basis, from the Sun 

Accounting software. The IFRs must be submitted to the Bank within 30 days after the end of 

the quarter reported on, while the annual audited financial reports must be submitted not later 

than six (6) months after the end of the applicable financial year. MOFA internal control 

systems, including the internal audit function (which appears adequate and operating 

effectively) shall be extended to the cover project operations too. A Project Implementation 

Manual (PIM) consisting of Technical Implementation, FM procedures and Administrative 

procedures components will be developed and adopted from the NRGP PIM, to guide project 

implementation, streamline FM practices and administrative procedures. Previous audits of 

MOFA managed Bank financed projects were generally satisfactory, however the finance staff 

tended to leave the service of MOFA/the project on completion of the project activities. 

 

4.1.10 Disbursement: Two of the Bank’s four disbursement methods are recommended to be 

used in disbursing funds to the project: (i) Direct payments; and (ii) Payments through Special 

Account (SA). Direct payments method will generally be used for the larger contracts signed 

between project management and contractors/suppliers/ service providers, while the SA method 

will be used for meeting recurrent/ administrative expenses and smaller contracts. A US Dollar 

denominated SA will be opened at the Bank of Ghana (BoG), to receive ADF resources from 

the Bank. A GHS (local currency) account will be opened at BoG to receive transfers from the 

SA for making payments in Ghana Cedis. A second GHS account will be opened at the BoG to 

receive counterpart cash contributions from the Government of Ghana. All project accounts 

will be managed by the PCMU. All disbursements under the project will follow the 

disbursements procedures outlined in the Bank’s Disbursement Handbook.  

 

4.1.11 Audit: The project will be audited by an external audit firm, selected competitively, and 

in accordance with agreed procedures involving the Ghana Audit Service (GAS), which despite 

having the constitutional mandate for all government audits, tends to outsource the audits of 

donor projects to acceptable audit firms. The audit will be conducted on terms of reference 

acceptable to the Bank, and shall be submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the 

end of the year audited.  

 

4.1.12 Overall Conclusion: The overall FM risk is assessed as moderate. To mitigate the risk 

further, MOFA is expected to hire an FMS and Accounts Officer for the project; develop a PIM 

which includes technical, financial management and administrative procedures components; 

and adopt/ upgrade the existing Sun Systems accounting software for use by the project.  

4.2 Monitoring 

4.2.1 The foundation for the overall project monitoring and evaluation systems will be the 

logical framework, a series of key performance indicators and project operational manual 

(POM) which will be prepared by the PCMU shortly after project loan approval. MOFA will 

monitor overall operations for planning and facilitation purposes for the production aspects of 

the project, implementation of the drainage and roads infrastructure for attainment of national 

standards. The PCMU will monitor and evaluate overall impact of the project including 

environmental and social compliance and performance and compile the project’s quarterly and 

annual reports for dissemination to the Bank Group, MOFA, other line ministries, and SADA. 

A mid-term review (MTR) will be undertaken two years after project start to review the 

project’s achievements and constraints. Similarly, upon completion of project investments at 

the end of program year four, the PCMU will prepare a Borrower’s project completion report.  

 



 

18 

4.2.2 The initial assessment of national capacity indicates a satisfactory rating. The Ghana 

Statistical Service leads the efficient production and management of quality official statistics 

based on international standards, and will be used to assess the contribution of the project 

towards the country and regional development goals and objectives as defined in the relevant 

development plans. In using the performance indicators and targets specified in the results-

based framework, project implementers tracking progress towards project results are expected 

to take special note of changes that reflect advancement towards the translation of outputs into 

development outcomes. In developing monitoring and planning indicators, they will be gender 

disaggregated. The key functions of the M&E Officer in the PCMU will be to ensure quality 

and accountability of monitoring; information management; facilitation of knowledge building; 

and knowledge sharing on monitoring and evaluation. 

4.3. Governance 

Based on Bank’s experience in implementing projects in Ghana, the existing governance 

practices and controls have been deemed satisfactory. The implementation of SAZAPIP 

requires good governance at all levels from the national to District levels. This is in relation to 

better responsiveness, transparency, accountability and efficiency in the use of resources. 

Hence, the institutional arrangement has been designed to ensure good governance, and will 

serve as an instrument for achieving Project objectives.  

 

4.4. Sustainability 

 

The ownership of the SAZAPIP is made manifest by the roles that various stakeholders played 

during formulation and preparation of the Project. The Ministry of Food and Agriculture put up 

a technical team of experts to review the various reports produced by the consultants. The 

maintenance of the access roads and sundry infrastructure will be included in the annual 

recurrent budget of the District Assemblies where the project sites reside. The present Project 

will build capacities of the Regional agricultural officers in agri-business management to ensure 

profitability for the value chain actors. 

4.5 Risk management 

The current agricultural policy and sectoral strategies of Ghana have been developed in a 

consultative manner with the full participation of all relevant stake holders. The Bank Group 

will engage in constant policy dialogue to ensure that the policy, institutional and funding 

(particularly public expenditure) environment remain conducive to agricultural growth and 

development. Furthermore, social risks will be reduced through gender-sensitive approaches 

and ensuring that the poor are not excluded from project benefits. SAZAPIP is expected to be 

classified as a Category 2 because the project activities are expected to have environmental and 

social impacts that can be avoided and minimised since they will mostly be site-specific. 

Climate screening is yet to be done. The following are the main risks identified and with 

mitigation measures.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

19 

Risks  Mitigation measures 

Macroeconomic risks - High 

probability: slow economic growth 

and deterioration of the country’s 

creditworthiness due to fall in cocoa 

and other commodity prices.  

Mitigation measure: The Bank will intensify the dialogue with 

the government to adopt supportive macroeconomic policies to 

rationalize fiscal expenditure, introduce exchange rate flexibility, 

strengthen the banking system to prevent systemic crisis, and 

implement structural reforms for economic diversification. 

Environmental, Social and Climate 

Risk – Medium probability: The 

project activities are anticipated to 

have site specific environmental and 

social risks. The proposed project 

area is prone to climate change 

impacts. 

Mitigation measures: An ESMF has been developed for the 

project. During project implementation, site specific ESMPs will 

incorporate integrated pest management plans and climate risk 

mitigation and adaptation measures. ESMP development and 

implementation will be part of the monitoring and reporting of the 

project activities.  

4.6 Knowledge Building 

Knowledge building will be vital to the success of the Project. Considering the new approach 

in agricultural commodity value chains development, the results of the Project will be 

monitored closely. Knowledge will be built on the evolving concept of decentralized 

implementation unit located in the District; the role of value chain actors including farmers and 

farmers’ organization, women, youth, private sector, commercial and public sector. Knowledge 

will be captured using analysis of M&E database, supervision missions, mid-term reports, and 

periodic impact assessments and field exchange visits of the stakeholders within and outside 

the production clusters. In addition, knowledge would be disseminated by showcasing the 

Project results using Bank’s communication systems (Intranet, short documentaries on Bank 

website, etc.). For the purposes of publicity and sharing of project results, the project could 

recruit a local firm as and when the need be. The Farmer Field Schools will serve as sources of 

innovative knowledge and information sharing learning tools empowering farmers and other 

actors of the value chain to train their peers, share knowledge and experiences, thus reducing 

their overdependence on the public extension agents. This will also expand significantly the 

number of value chain actors having access to the disseminated knowledge and information. 

The technical assistance supports will introduce and consolidate knowledge and skills, and 

facilitate technology and skills transfer both at the community and national levels. It is 

envisaged that knowledge generated by the pilot demonstration plots will form the basis for 

private sector investment in the agribusiness in the ecological zone as part of TASI.

Executive Summary 

Project overview: The Rice Value Chain Development Project (PDCV-Riz) was designed as part of a 

participatory and inclusive process bringing together all the stakeholders, including producer 

organizations, local communities and local technical services. Those discussions as well as the studies 

conducted by the Bank helped to make a thorough assessment of the situation and identify the 

development needs of the rice value chain, and the most suitable methods of implementation in the two 

regions concerned. The formulation of PDCV-Riz also took into account the fragile context in the 

country, lessons drawn from Bank projects and those of other partners in Guinea-Bissau, while 

developing synergies and complementarities. Factoring in the Bank’s strategic orientations for the 

country, the project was formulated with special emphasis on the following: (i) hydro-agricultural 

infrastructure and access to markets; (ii) food and nutrition security; (iii) value chain development; (iv) 

employment of young people and women; and (v) adaptation to the impacts of climate change. 

The specific goal of the proposed project, which is expected to cost UA 4.56 million and last four years, 

will be to ensure the sustainable recovery of the rice value chain in the Bafata and Oio regions. In 

addition to basic structuring infrastructure resulting from the project (development of 470 hectares of 

lowlands and mangroves, 7 km of roads, 2 markets, 5 stores and shops, etc.), innovative techniques 

needed for quality assurance, conservation and processing of food products will also be developed and 

disseminated. These activities will be accompanied by local and organizational capacity building, and 

specific focus will be placed on women’s access to land and all project benefits. The project will affect 

close to 1 720 farmers directly, 55% of whom will be women, representing about 12 000 members of 

agricultural households. It will have an indirect impact on approximately 60 000 people. 

Needs assessment: The project area is located in two of Guinea-Bissau’s nine regions, namely Bafata 

and Oio, which occupy 31.5% of the national territory and in 2015 had a population estimated at 494 

000 (27% of the national population). The project area is rich in water and land resources, owing in 

particular to the Corubal, Geba and Mansôa river basins. In keeping with the country’s strategic 

orientations, the project will help to improve productivity and production in the flagship sector for food 

security: rice. The country has an annual rice deficit of more than 80 000 tonnes. The project will also 

develop market gardening, the current production of which covers only 60% of needs, for certain sites 

and school canteens. This activity will help to improve the nutritional status of the beneficiary 

population, particularly women and children. The project will serve as a catalyst for agricultural 

development in the area by facilitating water control, strengthening agricultural infrastructure, 

promoting sustainable production, packaging and processing technologies, and facilitating access to 

product markets by supporting the development of the strategic sectors of rice and market gardening. 

Value added for the African Development Bank: Agriculture remains the main focus of development 

policies and the principal source of employment. In 2006, the Bank financed the Agricultural and Rural 

Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (PRESAR), which was followed by three studies on the agricultural 

sector financed by trust funds between 2012 and 2014. These operations helped to develop specific 

expertise and shed new light on key areas (irrigation, seed production and control, solar energy, 

processing, etc.). To consolidate these gains, the Bank and the Government elected to finance the Rice 

Value Chain Development Project (PDCV-Riz), as a way of setting up production areas. By supporting 

the development of infrastructure in areas that are economically and socially depressed but have 

considerable irrigation potential, the Bank’s activities will help to reduce poverty, promote the 

employment of young people and women, strengthen adaptation to climate change and increase the 

resilience of people who are vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity.  

Knowledge management: PDCV-Riz will contribute to farmers’ training and consolidate their 

expertise. It will allow young people and women to develop technical and entrepreneurial skills in an 

inclusive manner by setting up operations on land that has modern operational resources and 

infrastructure, and promote the expansion of para-agricultural activities. With regard to resilience to 

climate change, the project will develop and disseminate innovative agricultural technologies for 



 

v 

production, storage and processing, while promoting local expertise. It will support the development of 

drip irrigation expertise with the establishment of a demonstration site. Knowledge management will 

also be carried out through mechanisms for communication and capitalization of project results and best 

practices, and through the process of generating endogenous value for vulnerable groups by developing 

value chains.

RICE VALUE CHAIN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (PDCV-RIZ) IN THE BAFATA  

AND OIO REGIONS  
 

Management hereby submits this report concerning a proposal to extend a loan of UA 3.722 million 

and award a grant of UA 0.493 million to the Republic of Guinea-Bissau to finance the Rice Value 

Chain Development Project (PDCV-Riz) in the Bafata and Oio regions. 

I Strategic Thrust and Rationale 

 

1.1 Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives  

1.1.1 Accounting for 67% of GDP and 80% of jobs, agriculture remains the focus of development 
policies and, over the medium term, will continue to be the driver of growth and the main source of 

employment. Rice is the dominant food crop and the food deficit is made up annually by importing 

approximately 80 000 tonnes of rice. PDCV-Riz, which aims to improve food and nutrition security and 

boost producers’ income by promoting rice production and market gardening in targeted areas, is in line 

with the strategic objectives for Guinea-Bissau.1 These are set out in such documents as the Letter of 

Agricultural Development Policy (LPDA) and its plan of action, aimed at ensuring food security, 

increasing and diversifying agricultural exports, while ensuring sustainable management of agricultural, 

silvicultural and pastoral resources, and improving the living conditions of the rural population. Similarly, 

the strategic pillars of the strategic and operational plan for the period 2015-2020, known as Terra Ranka, 

developed and adopted by the Government of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, includes the following 

pillars: (a) governance and peace; (b) infrastructure; (c) industrialization; (d) urban development; (e) human 

development; and (f) biodiversity. The strategy underscores the need to work towards economic recovery 

based on structural reforms, in order to ensure sustainable development. It also highlights the four main 

engines of economic growth, including agriculture and agro-industry, which will be based on the 

development of cashew and rice production, while aiming for gender parity, equity and women’s 

empowerment. 

1.1.2 PDCV-Riz also plugs into Sub-programme 1 of the National Agricultural Investment Programme 
(PNIA) (“Promotion of Plant Production”), which focuses on the development of food crops (including 

rice) and market gardening, through better control of water and factors of production. It is also in line with 

the orientations of (a) the National Food Security Programme (PNSA), which aims to contribute to the 

gradual eradication of hunger and food insecurity, and promotion of the people’s comprehensive and 

sustainable socio-economic development; (b) the National Medium-Term Investment Programme 

(PNIMT), whose major goal is to speed up the growth of the agricultural and fisheries sector by increasing 

the flow of capital directed towards the sector, but also by enhancing the effectiveness of investments in 

terms of growth and poverty reduction; and (c) the Rice Farming Development Programme (PDR - 2016), 

which aims to stimulate rice production in sufficient quantity and quality to ensure supply and improve the 

balance of trade. The project is in keeping with the “Develop infrastructure to promote inclusive growth” 

pillar of the CSP 2015-2019 through the development of agricultural infrastructure and opportunities in 

agriculture (in particular for young people and women).  

1.2 Rationale for Bank Involvement  

1.2.1 According to the agriculture sector study conducted in 2014 (Portuguese Cooperation Trust 

Fund), it is essential to optimize the use of farmland, considering the limited land resources, to create added 

value for products, but also to enable households to generate sufficient income to purchase certain 

commodities that have to be imported. Rice is the staple foodstuff and food deficit is made up annually by 

rice imports of about 80 000 tonnes. The constraints in the sector are primarily the remoteness of production 

areas, the degradation of production systems, particularly mangroves, caused by salinity and acidity, 

                                                 
1  It also draws on the main findings of studies conducted by the Bank on the gender profile (financed by the Portugal Trust Fund and in partnership with 

UN-Women); agriculture (financed by the Portugal Trust Fund); Fragility in Guinea-Bissau, 2014 (financed by the Bank); and capitalization of 

PRESAR (financed by the South-South Cooperation Fund).

insufficient access to inputs, and weak processing capacity. It is against this backdrop that PDCV-Riz was 

prepared, to support the development of infrastructure in two of the country’s most vulnerable regions 

(poverty rates of 79% in Oio and 72% in Bafata). The Bank’s involvement will help to reduce poverty and 

regional and social disparities. The development of hydro-agricultural facilities, the integration of value 

chains and agricultural entrepreneurship will help to promote the employment of young people and 

women, strengthen adaptation to climate change and increase the resilience of the segments of the 

population that are vulnerable to food and nutritional insecurity.  

1.2.2 The objectives of PDCV-Riz are aligned on the Bank’s “High 5s” (five priorities), which 

include feeding the people of Africa by 2025 and improving their living conditions by developing the 

rice value chain, building the capacity of actors, creating jobs and generating income. The project is 

aligned on the Bank’s Long-Term Strategy (LTS 2013-2022) and its two overarching objectives: 

inclusive growth and transition to a green economy. The project is built on the three areas of special 

emphasis of the LTS: fragile States, agriculture and food security, and gender. PDCV-Riz is aligned on 

the Bank’s new strategy: “Feed Africa: Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in Africa (2016-

2025)”, which puts special emphasis on the development of value chains and agricultural 

entrepreneurship. The project also plans to rely heavily on grassroots associations, local NGOs and the 

private sector, thereby fulfilling the requirement for non-State actors to participate in the Bank’s 

operations, identified in the CSP as a way of strengthening the country’s resilience to fragility. The 

project is also in conformity with the Bank’s Gender Strategy (2014-2018) “Investing in Gender 

Equality for Africa’s Transformation”, more specifically Pillar II, “Economic Empowerment”. It also 

follows the recommendations of the gender profile prepared by the Bank and UN-Women in 2015, on 

the need to integrate women into value chains and provide extension services for women’s economic 

entities in rural areas.  

1.3 Aid Coordination  

1.3.1 Since the crisis of April 2012, the TFP consultation framework that was operating through 

multi-sector thematic groups has been put on hold. However, it should be noted that, in general, aid 

coordination and monitoring mechanisms have always suffered from the structural weaknesses of public 

administration. In this regard, before the coup d’état of 2012, the Bank approved a technical assistance 

project (PECA II) to build coordination capacity. The project included the convening of donor round 

tables in Brussels in March 2015 as well as capacity-building activities organized by the Ministry of 

Economy and Finance. 

1.3.2 Based on the Letter of Agricultural Development Policy, several bilateral and multilateral 

partners provided significant support for rural development and food and nutrition security in Guinea-

Bissau, including Spain, Italy, Brazil, Portugal, China, the European Union, the World Bank, AfDB, 

the West African Development Bank (BOAD), IFAD and the United Nations system. From an 

institutional standpoint, the activities of partners are coordinated by the Ministry of Economy and 

Finance. For agriculture in particular, the partners reached a consensus on the sector strategy, notably 

the PNIA, during the partners’ round table convened in Brussels in March 2015. The Food and 

Agriculture Organization plays a major role in policy support and coordination of activities. More 

broadly, in the rural sector (agriculture, stock raising, fishery, environment), the involvement of the various 

partners is presented in Annex A4 of volume 2 and is summarized as follows:

II Project Description 

 

2.1 Project Components 

The overall objective of PDCV-Riz is to help improve nutritional and food security and reduce poverty 

across the country. Its specific objective is to ensure sustainable recovery of the rice value chain in the 

Bafata and Oio regions by improving productivity, strengthening infrastructure, ensuring resilience to 

climate change, managing natural agricultural resources in a sustainable manner and reducing gender 

inequality. Lasting four years, PDCV-Riz revolves around three main components: (i) Modernization 

and development of agricultural infrastructure; (ii) Development of value chains; and (iii) Project 

management. The table below shows a summary of the activities selected. A detailed description is

2.2 Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Explored  

2.2.1 The technical solutions adopted for PDCV-Riz are based on field data and lessons drawn from 

similar projects, including those obtained from the PRESAR capitalization study, and on design 

methods tailored to the specific context of the two regions and each of the sites. 

 

2.2.2 With regard to the pre-selected sites, only the Bafata sites offered conditions conducive to the 

development of facilities with full irrigation water control. Several technical options were available in 

the Bafata region, including that of developing a single large area with water pumped from the Gébà 

River, where the project would be concentrated. That option was rejected in light of the management 

difficulties encountered in the past and the complexity of operating that type of facility, and the 

difficulty of having sufficient labour to develop the investments. The alternative was to develop several 

small areas on different sites, which would be easier to manage and set up. For other lowlands, the 



 

5 

solution adopted was that of partial control of runoff (cascading dykes equipped with regulators), but 

using manufactured structures, to ensure greater durability. For the mangrove sites, partial irrigation 

water control was the only technical solution possible. In essence, the process entails building an anti-

salt dyke equipped with regulators and partitioning the area using dykes and bunds for the retention and 

distribution of irrigation water on the parcels and partitions.  

 

2.2.3 Market gardening is a vitally important activity for improving the nutritional intake of 

households and is also a source of income for women. However, it has been noted that several pieces of 

land belonging to women, developed summarily, are abandoned owing to poor design and technical 

solutions that do not alleviate the tedious work of watering. To develop those pieces of land, the 

underground water will need to be captured by building or using large wells and/or boreholes, and 

equipping them with a dewatering system powered by a generator and/or solar panels. 

 
Table 2.2: Alternatives Explored and Reasons for Rejection 

Alternative Brief Description Reason for Rejection 

Develop just one 

large area with total 

control where the 

project would be 

concentrated 

Construction of a large pumping 

station, covered water 

transportation canals with large 

civil engineering structures for 

the collection, carriage and 

distribution of water to the 

various blocks and 

neighbourhoods. 

This alternative does not ensure the availability of 

labour, in terms of quantity or quality, for the 

development of the facilities and the investments 

required. It is quite likely that the area will not be 

fully used, whereas on several sites available labour 

could make better use of the irrigated areas and 

develop the project. 

Develop market 

gardening areas 

with improved 

wells without any 

dewatering 

mechanism 

Construction of one or more 

large wells (one well per hectare) 

where irrigation water is 

collected manually and carried 

to the parcels by the operators.  

The constraint for the development of market 

gardening production is manual dewatering of the 

wells. This takes up an enormous amount of work 

time, makes the task, which is carried out mainly by 

women, very tedious and limits the production 

capacity of women engaged in market gardening, 

causing them to lose interest. 

Develop animal-

drawn cultivation 

in the intermediary 

phase instead of 

motorizing soil 

cultivation 

activities 

Animal-drawn cultivation 

practised in the project regions is 

suited for light soils with limited 

humidity, to ensure high 

productivity. Its effectiveness 

depends a great deal on the 

physical conditions of the area to 

be cultivated.  

Large arable land in the region, the short period 

available for soil preparation and the short rainy 

season are factors militating against animal-drawn 

cultivation and in favour of motorized soil 

cultivation. The consolidation of the network of 

providers of agricultural mechanization services in 

the project region will help to achieve this goal. 

 

2.3 Project Type 

PDCV-Riz is an investment operation financed with ADF resources. The Government of Guinea-Bissau 

has not yet started implementing projects and programmes through the sector-based approach, given a 

number of institutional constraints and the context of fragility. At this juncture, the project approach is 

the most appropriate to ensure effective and efficient use of the resources allocated to the project, which 

will also consolidate the gains achieved with PRESAR. 

2.4 Project Cost and Financing Arrangements  

2.4.1 The project cost is estimated at UA 4.56 million, excluding taxes and custom duty (CFAF 

3.742 billion), with UA 1.45 million (CFAF 1.193 billion) in foreign exchange and UA 3.11 million 

(CFAF 2.549 billion) in local currency. Custom duty and taxes will be covered by the State, which will 

have to take the necessary measures to implement this provision. The foreign exchange portion 

represents 31.9% of the total cost, net of taxes, and the local currency portion represents 68.1%. The 



 

6 

physical contingency rate applied was 5% for works and 5% for equipment. A provision for 

compounded price escalation of 3% was applied on all components. The summary of the project cost 

by component and by expenditure category is presented in Tables 2.3 and 2.4 below.

2.4.2 The project will be financed by a grant of UA 0.493 million and loan of UA 3.722 million 

from the African Development Fund (ADF), representing 92.4% of the project cost, net of taxes and 

custom duty. Considering the country’s fragile state (see Annexes IV and V), the Government’s 

financial contribution, estimated at UA 0.136 million, will be limited to covering the salaries of civil 

servants seconded to the project and providing office space for the Project Management Unit 

(headquarters in Bafata and liaison office in Bissau), and setting up a revolving fund for the procurement 

of inputs (fertilizers and seeds). The contribution of beneficiaries will be limited to the computation of 

their participation in easy-to-undertake on-going development and maintenance work, estimated at UA 

0.21 million. The breakdown by source of financing is indicated in Table 2.5 below.

2.5 Project Target Area and Beneficiaries  

2.5.1 The project target area consists of two regions – Bafata and Oio – out of the eight (in addition 

to the autonomous region of Bissau) in Guinea-Bissau. It covers 31.5% of the national territory 

(representing a surface area of 36 125 km2) and has a population estimated in 2015 and 494 000 

inhabitants, compared with 1 783 000 inhabitants in the country (projection based on the General 

Population and Housing Census, 2009)2 The area is endowed with huge water resources (rain, the 

Corubal, Geba and Mansôa Rivers, sedimentary basin) and has strong potential of lowlands that can be 

developed (especially in Bafata) and mangrove plains (particularly in Oio). 

2.5.2 The project areas were selected following a multi-criteria analysis based on: (i) accessibility; 

(ii) existence of community/local operational dynamic; (iii) absence of latent land conflicts; and (iv) 

overall consistency with the project objectives (availability of labour, level of organization and sense of 

initiative of the future beneficiaries, expertise, participation of women and young people). A wide 

variety of sites were pre-identified: (i) Development of lowlands: (a) with partial irrigation water control 

(Carabina, Gêba, Cumuda and Olom sites); (b) with full irrigation water control (Contuboel, Gêba, 

Cumuda and Ponta Nova sites); (ii) Development of mangroves: partial irrigation water control 

(Binhomi); (iii) Market gardening areas: Contuboel, Carabina, Sormone, and ADPP training centre in 

Bissora.  

2.5.3 The majority of the population of the area is engaged in agriculture (rice, corn, cassava, 

peanuts, sorghum/millet, black-eyed peas, fruits and vegetables, cashew nuts, etc.), stock raising and 

trading. Traditional and family farming faces a variety of constraints, including the absence and age of 

facilities, difficulties in accessing factors of production (certified seeds, quality inputs, tilling and post-

harvest equipment, etc.). Women are involved in all rural farming activities and most participate in rice 

cultivation and market gardening work, and in product processing and marketing. The project target 

group comprises smallholders, in particular women and young people, the main segments of the 

population that are vulnerable to food and nutrition insecurity and poverty. The project will affect 1 720 

households/farmers, including 960 women farmers (55%), representing about 12 000 people (direct 

beneficiaries), including 6 400 women. The other direct targets are artisans, processors, traders, young 

entrepreneurs, about 200 students from three pilot school canteens, various service providers and NGOs, 

etc. In addition to infrastructure, innovative techniques needed for quality maintenance, conservation 

and processing of food products will be developed and disseminated, and accompanied by local and 

organizational capacity building. Specific attention will be paid to access to land for women and young 

people and all project beneficiaries. Therefore, PDCV-Riz will affect more than 60 000 people in all.

2.6 Participatory Approach in Project Identification, Design and Implementation  

2.6.1 The project design was based on a participatory approach involving all stakeholders: 

administration, producer organizations, women’s groups, civil society, private sector, technical and 

financial partners (TFPs), projects, etc. These broad-based consultations, which began with PRESAR 

and during studies supported by the Bank, continued during the PDCV-Riz preparation and appraisal 

mission. The consultation meetings convened in each of the two regions with all the parties (local 

technical services, NGOs and advisory support associations, local communities, representatives of 

beneficiaries, including women) helped with the identification by consensus of constraints and needs in 

the project area and for the two sectors involved. Focused discussions with institutional local partners 

and civil society and visits to different potential sites, followed by working sessions with beneficiaries, 

including women and young people, helped to fully examine the development of the area, identify 

support needs for the two sectors and the most appropriate methods of implementation, as well as the 

appropriate measures for effective implementation. The sites and activities were chosen following 

several investigations and fruitful discussions with beneficiaries and other actors involved. 

2.6.2 This entire participatory process showed that there was great interest for the project, which 

builds on the achievements of PRESAR and other past and on-going projects, and a broad consensus on 

its design and methods of implementation. Producers reaffirmed the need to fully exploit the project 

area’s considerable potential (land, natural watercourses, mangroves, lowlands, etc.). Women expressed 

their interest for market gardening, processing and marketing of farm products, with modernization of 

production and processing tools and improved access to markets. Following visits to various sites, the 

status of the existing facilities and infrastructure was assessed and technological options to be adopted 

for their construction/rehabilitation were proposed. The development of a good communication strategy 

centred on PDCV-Riz and the maintenance of a participatory approach during its implementation are 

guarantees that local actors will take ownership of the project during the execution phase.  

2.7 Bank Group Experience Reflected in and Lessons Learned from Project Design  

2.7.1 It will be recalled that since the start of cooperation with Guinea-Bissau, the Bank has carried 

out operations in the agricultural sector through five projects, the last of which was the Agricultural and 

Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (PRESAR) costing UA 5.80 million, completed in September 

2012. The project completion report, which was submitted in February 2014, showed satisfactory results 

(score of 3.12 out of 4), in a difficult socio-economic context. PRESAR contributed to the rehabilitation 

of rice farming land and other agricultural community infrastructure, while building administrative 

capacity. The formulation of PDCV-Riz takes into account, to a large extent, lessons drawn from Bank 

projects in Guinea-Bissau, particularly PRESAR, and in the sub-region, while striving to integrate the 

country’s context of fragility, and rectifying some of the weaknesses identified during project 

implementation and highlighted during portfolio reviews and in completion reports. During the last 

review in September 2016, the portfolio’s performance was deemed satisfactory, but efforts will have 

to be made in terms of: (i) availability of studies to improve the quality-at-entry of operations; (ii) timely 

designation of project management teams, including the coordinator and financial management and 

procurement officers; (iii) compliance with the procurement schedule; (iv) systematic establishment of 

performance contracts and annual evaluation of the contracts on an objective basis; and (v) timely 

development of the baseline situation and establishment of monitoring and evaluation systems. It is 

worth noting that even though the current portfolio does not include any problem projects (PPs), two 

projects have suffered considerable implementation delays and may be cancelled pursuant to Directive 

No. 02/2015: (i) the Economic Governance Strengthening Support Project (PARGEF), approved on 1 

July 2015, and the Project to Improve Electricity Service in the City of Bissau (PASEB), approved on 

8 July 2015. 

2.7.2 Therefore, the design of PDCV-Riz took into account: (i) enhancement of the quality-at-entry 

of the project by making feasibility studies available and preparing the first computer-assisted designs 

(CADs); (ii) special focus on the involvement of local actors, in particular producers directly concerned, 



 

9 

through an inclusive participatory process; (iii) involvement of other partners (BOAD, WFP, etc.), to 

ensure coherence, complementarity and synergies in selected activities; (iv) focus on the procurement 

process and methods, relying on an experienced project team that was already in place; and (v) 

indispensable capacity-building needs of the various actors. Taking into account the aforementioned 

strategic guidelines, the project formulation also emphasized certain topics, in particular: (i) food and 

nutrition security; (ii) value chain approach; (iii) employment of young people and women; and (iv) 

resilience to climate change. To ensure good quality-at-entry and to anticipate performance essential to 

the start-up of activities, the initial sites chosen for development were those for which studies were 

available or at an advanced stage (market gardening sites, Contuboel, National Agricultural Research 

Institute (INPA) station, etc.). All these arrangements will help to satisfy the design and implementation 

criteria set out in Presidential Directive No. 002/2015. 

2.8 Key Performance Indicators 

The monitoring and evaluation specialist will be responsible for the internal monitoring and evaluation 

of project activities and logical framework indicators, working in liaison with the technical experts (rural 

engineer, food crop specialist and producer organizations). Special emphasis will be placed on the 

targeting of areas that might be monitored and collected internally, and those relating specifically to 

women and young people (data disaggregated for women and young people). The main performance 

indicators that will be monitored from the baseline scenario include: (i) surface area of lowlands and 

mangroves developed with partial control for rice; (ii) surface area of rice-growing areas developed with 

full control; (iii) surface area of market gardening areas developed; (iv) infrastructure developed 

(number of markets commissioned, kilometres of farm roads, number of stores for storage of produce, 

number of input shops, etc.); (v) level of additional production (tonnes) and crop yields (t/ha); (vi) 

number of farmers (including women) per type of facility; (vii) number of demonstration units (DUs), 

technological review workshops organized; (viii) number of structured producer organizations and 

management committees established, (ix) growth level of farmers’ income, including those of women 

and young people; (x) number of jobs created for young people and women through entrepreneurial 

initiatives and number of young entrepreneurs who set up operations; (xi) number of producers, 

processors and traders trained and organized; (xii) level of involvement of women in decision-making 

bodies and their rate of access to post-development land; (xiii) number of processing units established 

and allocated (including for women); and (xiv) number of nutrition activities supported and level of 

incidence on food and nutrition security. All indicators selected for the project will be aligned on those 

selected for the PNIA and will help to enhance the performance of the agricultural sector in Guinea-

Bissau. The Bank’s various supervision missions and periodic activity reports will reflect the level of 

achievement of the indicators. 

III Project Feasibility 

 

3.1 Financial and Economic Performance 

Table 3.1: Main Economic and Financial Data 

NPV (baseline scenario) CFAF 7,378 million  

IRR (baseline scenario) 14.6% 

ERR (baseline scenario) 17.1% 

 

3.1.1 The project’s financial and economic analysis was conducted based on cost/benefit of 

additional cash flow from the production models of the two priority sectors (rice and market gardening). 

The following assumptions were used: (i) the period for evaluating the impact of PDCV-Riz is 25 years; 

(ii) the average basic prices, yields and production costs of the 2015/2016 farm year were selected for 

the baseline scenario and realistic projections were made up to the cruising period of the project, taking 

into account the existing potential and the absorptive capacity of beneficiaries; (iii) additional income 

was determined by calculating the difference between the baseline scenario and the with-project 



 

10 

scenario, based on gross proceeds less production costs; (iv) an equal inflation rate was selected for jobs 

and resources on the cash flow table; (v) for the calculation of the economic rate of return, a cost 

correction coefficient was added for factors related to distortions inherent in customs duty. The detailed 

assumptions of the financial and economic analysis, the tables of the operating models (baseline 

scenario and with-project scenario) and financial and economic flows are presented in Annex B7 of 

Volume 2. The results of the financial and economic analysis show that PDCV-Riz is financially and 

economically sustainable. 

3.1.2 Financial performance: The additional income resulting from the different development and 

operating models selected is as follows: (i) mangroves with partial water control (rice): CFAF 555 

000/hectare and CFAF 278 000 per operator; (ii) lowlands with partial water control (rice): FCFA 676 

000/hectare and FCFA 290 000 per operator; (iii) lowlands with full water control (double cropping of 

rice and seeds): CFAF 2 220 000/hectare and CFAF 555 000 per operator; (iv) lowlands with full water 

control (double cropping of rice for final consumption): CFAF 1 376 000/hectare and CFAF 344 000 

per operator; and (v) irrigated market gardening: CFAF 3 415 000/hectare and CFAF 341 000 per 

beneficiary. The additional income generated will help to increase the overall value added of the project 

and hence its contribution to the agricultural GDP. The internal rate of return (IRR) is estimated at 

14.60%, for an NPV of CFAF 6,974 million. With sensitivity tests established based on a 10% income 

reduction, a 10% cost increase and a 10% simultaneous cost increase and income reduction, the IRR 

comes to 12.3%, 12.5% and 10.3%, respectively. This IRR is relatively satisfactory and will help to 

reduce the poverty rates in the project area.  

3.1.3 Economic performance: The economic rate of return (ERR) stands at 17.1%, for a net present 

value (NPV) of CFAF 7,378 million. In the context of Guinea-Bissau, this amount is significant: by 

comparison, it represented 11.2% of the country’s tax revenue or 1.3% of its GDP in 2014. The 

sensitivity tests established on the same basis as above bring the ERR to 14.6%, 14.8% and 12.5%, 

respectively. The other project economic impacts can be summarized as follows: (i) upstream effects of 

additional income on providers (NGOs, businesses, suppliers, engineering firms); (ii) downstream 

effects of the generation of additional income on producers, traders and processors, essentially women; 

(iii) decrease in foreign exchange costs owing to the sharp reduction of rice import costs in the trade 

balance; and (iv) the incidence on wealth creation in the country owing to an increase in GDP resulting 

from the generation of additional value added. For households, the benefits of the project will translate 

into, among other things, better nutrition for vulnerable groups (children, women of child-bearing age 

and the elderly); reduction of medical bills and the difficulty of agricultural tasks, especially those 

performed by women; decrease in the incidence of monetary and non-monetary poverty; strengthening 

of livelihoods and resilience of the targets of PDCV-Riz in relation to food insecurity and the effects of 

climate change. 

3.2 Environmental and Social Impact 

3.2.1 Environment: The environmental and social impacts of the facilities of PDCV-Riz will not be 

significant. The facilities will be relatively modest and will be built in less environmentally sensitive 

communities. Their dispersion throughout the two regions of Oio and Bafata will also reduce their 

impacts. It is also worth noting that there are no protected areas or reserved forests3 in the project area. 

The main impacts anticipated are quite positive. Appropriate measures will be taken to address the 

potential negative impacts (conflicts between farmers and herders, poor use of pesticides, water-borne 

diseases, etc.). Under the Bank’s Environmental Safeguards Policies, the project was classified in 

Category 2 and was the subject of a strategic environmental assessment, and an environmental and 

social management framework was developed because the sites where the infrastructure will be located 

had not yet been selected. The Competent Environmental Assessment Authority (AAAC) of Guinea-

Bissau has also classified the project in Category B, the equivalent of the Bank’s Category 2 

                                                 
3 Guinea-Bissau does not have a forest reserve. Its primary forest relics are being gradually replaced by mono-specific cashew farms, considerably 

reducing biodiversity in the two regions.   



 

11 

classification, pursuant to Act No. 10/2010 of 24 September 2010 on environmental assessments. The 

environmental and social management framework as well as its summary were approved by the 

Safeguards Division and published on the Bank’s website on 7 November 2016. 

3.2.2 For the implementation of the environmental aspects of the project, the arrangements made 

with the AAAC include: validation of the environmental and social assessment reports at the national 

level, AAAC’s implication in the environmental screening of sub-projects, validation of impact studies 

related to the sub-projects, and where applicable, oversight of the implementation of mitigation 

measures, as well as environmental monitoring. In this regard, the project will sign a memorandum of 

cooperation with the AAAC for better management of the environmental aspects of the project. The 

budget for future impact studies of sub-projects, implementation of resulting measures, the capacity-

building programme for the administration and the beneficiary population, institutional support for the 

AAAC and environmental monitoring is estimated at slightly more than UA 71 000. The capacity 

building will address directly a constraint identified in the CSP for Guinea-Bissau.  

3.2.3 Climate change: The project was classified a Category 2 project following climate screening 

based on the Bank’s safeguards system against the effects of climate change. This category corresponds 

to projects that may be vulnerable to climate risks and that require a climate risk review and the proposal 

of appropriate adaptation measures to mitigate those risks.  

3.2.4 Main characteristics of the country’s climate: Despite the relative climate stability seen over 

the past few decades, there are still some variability in the country’s climate parameters, in particular 

irregularity in the frequency of rainfall and a worsening of the rainfall deficit in a few regions, notably 

the North and the East. Projections by the Weather Service for 2100 call for an 11.7% decrease in 

rainfall, a 2% increase in temperature and a 50-cm increase in average sea levels. However, rainfall 

surpluses can also be seen from year to year in certain parts of the country, due essentially to exceptional 

climate events attributable, in particular, to global climate disturbances. However, the level of variation 

in rainfall over the past decade remains low. 

3.2.5 Main climate risks in the project area: There is no known history of severe drought in the 

project area. During the rainy season, rice farms may sometimes become flooded in places during 

periods of normal rainfall. This phenomenon is primarily the result of sand silting in the natural canals 

that serve as outlets to the production sites. 

3.2.6 Mitigation measures: To deal with the effects of climate change, the project will adopt the 

measures prescribed by the National Action Programme for Adaptation to Climate Change (PANA) 

following participatory assessments of the country’s vulnerability and adaptation to climate change, 

based on the agricultural sector diagnoses. The PANA offers a set of adaptation measures, most notably 

a significant increase in the level of food security among the people by building the adaptation capacity 

of agricultural production systems, in order to reduce the pressure on forest and fishery resources, while 

improving access to drinking water for human consumption and for cattle. The project fully aligns its 

activities on PANA’s strategic orientations by developing lowlands and horticulture, with a view to 

strengthening the food and nutrition security of the beneficiary population. The project will use a holistic 

approach that is designed to eliminate constraints at all levels of the rice and horticultural value chains. 

More specifically, it will introduce in the horticultural areas solar technology for water control and for 

reducing substantially the use of fossil energies in the dewatering systems.  

3.2.7 For better management of occasional flooding in rice fields, the natural canals of the target 

sites will be drained and resized to allow for the evacuation of any excess flow in the rice-growing 

lowlands concerned. To prevent sanding in rice fields, which is the primary cause of flooding in the 

lowlands, bunds consolidated with soil-fixing plants will be built opposite slopes with strong runoff. At 

the foot of the bunds, evacuators will be created to make it easy for runoff to be drained laterally to 

appropriate deposition areas. Water resources will be better managed with facilities, which will be 

upgraded and equipped with an adequate drainage system. Irrigation will be offered on sites with water 



 

12 

potential that can adequately meet crop water needs. The project will also make it easier for producers 

to acquire certified seeds by putting in place a programme related to the INPA and multiplier 

organizations. It will also introduce reasoned use of fertilizer to improve yields, and hence agricultural 

productivity. The related agricultural infrastructure will be set up and designed with additional measures 

for adapting to climate change, to make them more resilient. 

3.2.8 Involuntary resettlement: The activities of PDCV-Riz will not lead to any resettlement of 

people or restriction of access to goods and means of living. 

3.2.9 Gender: In collaboration with UN-Women, the Bank established a gender profile for Guinea-

Bissau in 2014. The situational analysis shows that, out of a population of 1.7 million people (2014 

estimate), 50.3 % are women. The average number of school enrolment among women is 1.4 and 76.5 

% of women live below the poverty line. This unfavourable situation for women is even more 

pronounced at a time of political instability and weak economic performance in the country. Even 

though more than 80% of women work in the agricultural sector, including in the processing and 

marketing of farm products, access to land, particularly for rice farming, and to factors of production 

remains limited. They are confined to farm work and to processing with rustic implements. In the 

regions targeted by the project, 60% of rice farmers in the lowlands are women. The horticultural areas 

are essentially used by women, who occupy virtually the entire value chain. |For this project, and in 

keeping with its new strategy, the Bank will pay special attention to the strategic interests of women, 

promotion of inclusive growth and improvement of the status of women in the two regions covered.  

3.2.10 The project will give priority to rural activities undertaken by women, for which they have 

recognized expertise (market gardening, lowland rice farming, processing activities, marketing, etc.) 

and from which they can derive an income. The three horticultural areas are essentially reserved for 

women, as is a good portion of lowland rice fields, with land-securing mechanisms that will be 

supported by the project (social assessment, consultation frameworks, licensing, etc.). The increase in 

the purchasing power of beneficiaries (income rising from CFAF 114 000 to 359 000/rice farm and 

from CFAF 37 000 to 373 000/market gardening farm) will enable the 1 720 households concerned, 

particularly the women, to have easier access to basic socio-economic services. The project will apply 

affirmative action in favour of women and vulnerable groups in any area where local practices tend to 

exclude them from decision-making bodies or from certain benefits. In general, the project will ensure 

that women have access to factors of production (developed land, agricultural inputs, production 

equipment and materials), in the organization and management of new infrastructure (stores, markets, 

etc.), as well as access to training. Therefore, it will help to strengthen the economic empowerment and 

decision-making power of women, which will give them greater social visibility and bolster their socio-

economic status. Specifically, the budget allocated specifically to gender promotion activities is UA 

833 000. 

3.2.11 Nutrition: The project will develop initiatives to improve the hygiene and nutritional quality 

of food consumed by the people, especially by women and children, and will collaborate with the World 

Food Programme to develop three school canteens as a pilot. The additional production of rice (2 000 

tonnes) and horticultural products (390 tonnes) will help to improve feeding and nutrition, and hence 

the health of the population. The need to incorporate direct nutrition activities into the project activities 

is essential to have an impact on the nutritional status of the population. Specific and indirect nutrition 

activities of the programme will also help to improve the nutritional status of children and women. The 

setting up of vegetable gardens in some schools with the help of women’s groups will contribute to 

enhancing the food regime within the communities. Activities designed to prevent the resurgence of 

water-borne diseases will also help to improve health and nutrition among the population. 

3.2.12 Social: The different activities undertaken as part of the project (improved access to factors of 

production, technical itineraries for production, processing and marketing) will help considerably in 

ensuring food and nutrition security, and raising income levels. In so doing, they will help to reduce the 

poverty rate considerably. The project will further strengthen connectivity between producers and 



 

13 

markets through partnerships that will be beneficial for all actors of the rice and horticulture value 

chains. Strengthening food security through the developments and raising awareness of good feeding 

practices will help to improve the nutritional status of the population, particularly of vulnerable groups 

such as women of childbearing age and children below the age of five. The rehabilitation of roads, 

construction of storage/conservation stores, rehabilitation of markets and support of processing units 

will contribute to reducing post-harvest losses (expected to decline by at least 20%), make it easier to 

sell products, and therefore increase agricultural production and household income. By making it easier 

for beneficiaries to participate in decision-making processes and to secure land (management of 

community infrastructure, management of conflicts between farmers and herders, maintenance of access 

roads, etc.), the project will also be instrumental in bolstering the local development process and 

promoting good governance.  

3.2.13 The promotion of rural entrepreneurship among young people and women (close to 100 

persons targeted), will help to create a business culture among people proposing projects aimed at 

increasing the income of poor people and creating jobs for young people and women. The development 

of agricultural entrepreneurship will make the rural areas more attractive and create several production 

hubs in the project area, through training of young producers and helping them set up their operations. 

This approach will make it possible to obtain concrete results and ensure that actions are sustainable. 

The project will also make it easier for young promoters to acquire materials, equipment and critical 

inputs (basic kits) based on their business plans and areas of specialization. The training will involve 

basic concepts and specialization modules. There will also be a la carte training, taking into account the 

specific needs identified in the project area  

IV Implementation 

 

4.1 Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1 Implementation procedure: The project implementation will hinge on an autonomous 

coordination arrangement, involving a small team based at Bafata and placed under the supervisory 

authority of the MADR, with a liaison office at Bissau. The team will comprise a national coordinator, 

an administrative and financial officer responsible for accounting management, a procurement 

specialist, a monitoring/evaluation officer, a rural engineering expert, an agricultural engineer 

specialized in value chains and a specialist in famer organizations and gender, a liaison officer based in 

Bissau and support staff. Given its experience (proper understanding of Bank procedures, participation 

in formulation, etc.), and good results obtained in the implementation of PRESAR, the PRESAR expert 

team will be responsible for implementing and monitoring PDCV-Riz activities. An order was issued 

by the MADR on 26 October 2016 confirming the team. The experts will all sign a performance 

contract, which will be evaluated annually.  

4.1.2 Considering the weak capacity of State services and actors at the grassroots, NGOs 

(APRODEL and ADPP, which are firmly implanted respectively in Bafata and Oio) will be recruited to 

strengthen the conduct of activities in the areas of leadership, advisory support and training, structuring 

and organization of producers, around value chains. Agreements and protocols will be signed with these 

entities, specifying their respective roles and the expected outcomes. An agreement will also be signed 

with the Competent Environmental Assessment Authority (AAAC) for the environmental monitoring 

of the project. Furthermore, the project will ensure close involvement of the regional directorates of 

agriculture in Bafata and Oio. Private service providers (contractors, consulting firms, NGOs, individual 

consultants, etc.) will be responsible for the delivery of certain works, goods and services, in accordance 

with the procurement methods defined in the financing agreements. The NGOs known as ADPP and 

APRODEL, which have specific infrastructure and expertise in the project area, will be responsible for 

training, structuring and producer support. The local population will take part in certain labour-intensive 

works (ring dykes, live hedges and routine maintenance) under the supervision of specialized NGOs 

and with the support of the Directorate-General of Forestry and Wildlife. 



 

14 

4.1.3 Supervision of activities: A Steering Committee will be set up, chaired by the Minister in 

charge of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR), or his/her designated 

representative. The Committee's secretarial services will be provided by the Project Coordinator. In 

addition to the relevant MADR technical departments, the Steering Committee will comprise: the 

Directorate-General for Planning, the Ministry of Infrastructure, the Secretariat of State for the 

Environment, the Ministry in charge of Women and Youth, ANAG and QNCOCPA. Its functions will 

include: (i) monitoring the project implementation; (ii) ensuring coherence and planning of eligible 

activities; (iii) conducting an annual review of the progress report, and approving the annual technical 

programme and budget; (iv) evaluating the project impacts and outcomes; (v) identifying constraints to 

and opportunities for the improvement of project impacts; and (vi) ensuring technical and 

methodological compliance with project objectives, the objectives of the Terra Ranka PSO and relevant 

sector policies, including the PNIA and the Rice Development Strategy. The Steering Committee will 

meet twice a year to review the project outcomes, validate the financial statements, discuss the 

programmes and approve the budgets related thereto. 

4.1.4 Procurement: The procurement of goods (including non-consultancy services), works and 

consultancy services financed by the Bank for the project will be carried out in accordance with the 

Procurement Framework for Operations Financed by the Bank Group, October 2015, and in accordance 

with the provisions set out in the financing agreements. However, although progress has been made to 

forge public procurement in Guinea-Bissau into a functional system, substantial progress remains to be 

made, notably in the regulatory and management frameworks, internal and external oversight, the 

complaints mechanism, building the capacity of all actors in public procurement, and putting in place 

mechanisms for the coherent and effective operationalization of the various bodies involved in the 

process (ANAP, DGCP and ARCP). Risk assessment was carried out at the country, sector and project 

levels and the procurement capacity of the executing agency evaluated. The outcomes (substantial risks 

for the most part) helped to guide the selection of the procurement system (Borrower, Bank, or Third 

Party) used for specific activities or for a set of similar activities under the project. Therefore, the Bank's 

Procurement Methods and Procedures (BPMPs) based on the relevant standard competitive bidding 

documents (SCBDs) will be used for the procurement of goods, works and consultancy services. 

Appropriate risk mitigation measures have been included in the PERCA Action Plan provided in 

paragraph B.5.2 of Annex B5, Volume 2.  

4.1.5 Financial management: Given that the public management system in force in the MADR was 

deemed unsatisfactory upon assessment, a parallel accounting system based on the SYSCOHADA 

accrual accounting method will be set up and managed by a PMU officer responsible for the 

administrative, financial and accounting management of the project. The PMU of PDCV-Riz will 

comprise, in addition to the other experts, an Administrative and Financial Officer (AFO) who will have 

at his/her disposal the management tools that were procured under PRESAR. These tools, comprising 

the administrative, financial and accounting procedures manual and the accounting management 

software package, will be updated and adapted to the new project prior to its start-up and the staff trained 

in the use of such tools. The AFO will produce quarterly financial monitoring reports providing details 

on the implementation of activities and the use of the financial resources of the project, and an annual 

financial statements consisting of the balance sheet, table of supply and use, status of the capital assets 

and notes to the financial statements to which the reconciliation statement of the special account will be 

annexed. The satisfactory experience acquired by the Project Management Unit of the Bank-financed 

PRESAR project warrants the maintenance of the same financial management staff since they have the 

requisite qualifications. Training on Bank financial management requirements will be provided by Bank 

experts at project launch. 

4.1.6 Disbursements: The financial implementation of the project will mainly involve the 

reimbursement, special account and direct payment methods. An account will be opened with a 

commercial bank acceptable to the Bank to receive part of the ADF loan resources and will be used to 

finance operating expenses. Opening of this account will be a condition precedent to first disbursement. 



 

15 

This special account will be used for an initial advance whose amount will be determined based on the 

estimated budget for six months of project activities. The special account will be replenished on the 

same basis after the borrower must have justified the use of at least 50% of the amount of the previous 

advance. The direct payment method will be used for expenses relating to goods, services and works 

contracts. Training in Bank disbursement rules and procedures will be provided at the project launch. 

4.1.7 Audits: In accordance with the general conditions applicable to African Development Fund 

financing agreements, the country shall account for the use of the resources that it will be allocated. 

Therefore, an independent and competent external audit firm will verify once a year the reliability of 

the consolidated annual financial statements prepared by the project management team, and will assess 

the functioning of the internal oversight system of the entire project. The audit firm will be recruited 

according the Bank’s terms of reference and following a competitive bidding procedure recommended 

by the Bank. The terms of reference shall be subject to the Bank’s prior approval. The continuation of 

audit services during the last two years will be contingent on the Bank's validation of the audit report 

for the first year. The audit expenses will be financed with ADF resources. Audit reports will be 

forwarded to the Bank on an annual basis latest six months following the close of the audited fiscal year. 

4.2 Monitoring  

4.2.1 Monitoring mechanisms: The project's monitoring and evaluation system will be designed in 

relation to the activities selected and the expected outputs and outcomes contained in the logical 

framework of the project. The system will be participatory and will provide regular information on 

performance and impact indicators as well as on the implementation of planned activities. The project 

partners will be systematically involved in the data collection and monitoring effort. A baseline situation 

will be established, based on the final hydro-agricultural sites selected. The monitoring and evaluation 

framework will systematically include gender-disaggregated data to make the outcomes concerning 

women, youths and the most vulnerable groups more visible. Targeted surveys will also be conducted 

to better understand issues relating to income, food security, nutrition, job creation, gender 

mainstreaming, and aspects related to vulnerability and resilience. The information collected will be fed 

into the computerized monitoring and evaluation system to capture actual values and gauge the impacts 

and outcomes of the project. This information will be recorded in periodic progress reports, highlighting 

the level of progress of the project and the achievement of outcomes. External monitoring and evaluation 

missions involving the relevant sector departments and GAPLA will also be organized regularly by the 

Government, in addition to the two annual supervision missions fielded by the African Development 

Bank with the support of its Dakar Office.

4.3 Governance 

4.3.1 Indicators relating to political, economic and social governance remain mixed in Guinea-

Bissau, despite the progress made in recent years. As regards political governance, it is necessary to 

find lasting resolutions to possible conflicts and establish mechanisms for ensuring justice. Indeed, in 

2016, the country was ranked 44th out of 54 countries in the Mo Ibrahim African Governance Index 

(and particularly 43rd in the rule of law sub-indicator). In the area of economic governance, particularly 

in public financial management, the country’s performance has deteriorated as a result of the crisis and 

the capacity to mobilize domestic resources remains weak, as noted in the Bank’s analysis on the 

governance of projects approved in 2015 and in the CPIA scores for 2016 (Country Policy and 

Institutional Assessment).   

4.3.2 As part of PDCV-Riz implementation, and in an effort to mitigate the risks inherent in the 

weaknesses and instability of the administration and improve the project quality-at-entry, it was decided 

to maintain the Project Management Unit (PMU) of the Agricultural and Rural Sectors Rehabilitation 

Project (PRESAR), since this PMU was already conversant with Bank procedures, and to capitalize on 

existing implementation studies, particularly those relating BOAD and PESAR capitalization. 

Moreover, although progress has been achieved in aligning the procurement system on WAEMU 

guidelines, the bureaucracy characterizing the procurement system is still one of the main challenges in 

the implementation of development programmes. Regarding procurement, operational arrangements 

were adopted to address the weaknesses observed.   

4.4 Sustainability  

Rudimentary facilities often have a limited lifespan and require major rehabilitation from time to time, 

which may exceed the capacity of beneficiaries, including women, who are heavily involved in rice 

farming. In this respect, the project will pay special attention to the quality and sustainability of the 

facilities that will be put in place. Structuring works will be carried out based on detailed technical 

studies and will involve specialized enterprises or skilled jobbers. That will concern works on large-

scale retention, anti-salt or protection dykes, major drainage ditches and irrigation canals, spillways, 

certain levelling works, etc. Labour-intensive techniques will be reserved only for certain secondary 

developments that can be reasonably carried out by the people, such as routine maintenance of facilities 

that been built already. On the other hand, the facilities enhance the people's adaptive capacity and 

resilience to recurrent climate risks, and reduce the economic vulnerability of beneficiaries. The high 

motivation of the beneficiaries observed during field missions is a factor that guarantees their 



 

17 

participation in all maintenance activities and works, and consequently the sustainability of the facilities. 

Other factors that will contribute to the sustainability of the project include secure tenure rights over the 

land where the project is located, support for the organization of beneficiaries and adoption of 

management tools to ensure the proper maintenance and the settlement of the recurrent costs of 

infrastructure (irrigation schemes, markets, stores, farm-to-market roads, etc.), and enhancement of the 

organization of producers. In addition, activities under the component for the promotion of rural 

entrepreneurship, processing and market access are sources that will generate value added and create 

wealth, which are factors of ownership of project achievements by the direct beneficiaries.   

4.5 Risk Management  

Political instability, coupled with a difficult economic situation, poses a real risk to the implementation 

of this project, and other portfolio operations. The weak capacity of the technical services involved, lack 

of familiarity with the procedures and the cumbersome procurement process, weak ownership of project 

achievements by beneficiaries and risks of conflicts between farmers and transhumant stockbreeders 

could adversely impact adherence to the project implementation schedule and the achievement of 

outcomes. However, these risks will be minimized by the fact that: (i) the development of the 

infrastructure needed to improve socio-economic and environmental resilience will lay the groundwork 

for inclusive growth and improved stability; (ii) the project team (formerly the PRESAR team) is already 

familiar with Bank procedures; (iii) the involvement of technical services and beneficiaries in the 

preparation of PDCV-Riz and the selection of sites, land tenure security measures, and the structuring 

and training of management and maintenance committees involving women, will lead to better 

performance and ownership. Through its second component, PDCV-Riz will scale up the support 

provided to communities in order to guarantee the sustainability and durability of investments, on an 

economically and socially viable basis.  

4.6 Knowledge Building 

PDCV-Riz operations that will lead to better management and knowledge development may be 

summarized as follows: (i) strengthening of local expertise in the area of local community resilience 

and adaptability to the recurrent impacts of climate change, through hydro-agricultural works and better 

control of water resources; (ii) dissemination of new production and processing technologies: 

development of expertise in drip irrigation techniques by setting up a demonstration site at the Bissora 

ADPP location, dissemination of solar dryers and onion storage sheds, and promotion of mechanization; 

(iii) establishment of demonstration units and dissemination of best practice: integrated soil fertility 

management (ISFM), sustainable land management (SLM), integrated water resource management 

(IWRM) and integrated pest and production management (IPPM) will help to protect and preserve 

resources, and mitigate the vulnerability of soil resources; (iv) organization of production and 

transformation technology review workshops and exchange visits as tools for encouraging interaction 

between researchers, consultants and producers in an effort to adapt technologies to the local context; 

(v) conduct of awareness and information campaigns through various communication channels 

(community radios, media programmes, websites, films, etc.); and (vi) promotion of innovative youth 

and women's employability actions in conjunction with ADPP, and activities to enhance the resilience 

of vulnerable groups to food and nutrition insecurity.   

V Legal Framework  

 

5.1 Legal Instrument  

The legal framework of the project will be a Protocol Agreement and a Loan Agreement signed between

Program summary 

Overview. The Rural Livelihood’s Adaptation to Climate Change in the Horn of Africa – Phase II 

(RLACC II) project is a multinational program that covers Somalia and Sudan. The program activities 

are country-driven and will be implemented through two Projects respectively in Sudan and Somalia. 

- The Sudan component targets the States of White Nile, Gedaref and Kassala, for a total cost of 

USD 7,082,407; 

- The Somalia component targets Somaliland (Awal region, villages of Quljeed, Ton and 

Salawley-Cheikh Hared), Puntland (Bari and Nugaal region), and South Central Somalia 

(Galguduud and Hiraan States), for a total of USD 9,985,185. 

Project Outcomes. The project is expected to improve the resilience of pastoral and agro-pastoral 

communities to climate change in the two countries  through: (i) introducing adaptation strategies to 

reduce the negative impacts of climate change and strengthen the capacity of pastoral/agro-pastoral 

households to cope with climatic hazards, (ii) enhancing the capacity of communities to not only absorb 

shocks, but to also effectively adapt their livelihoods to harsher climatic conditions, (iii) helping pastoral 

and agro-pastoral households manage drought risks, (iv) supporting community-led initiatives to protect, 

conserve and restore natural resources in a sustainable and climate-resilient manner, (v) strengthening 

the participation of pastoral communities in planning and implementing activities pertaining to their 

development. 

Although the RLACC II program targets specific villages or regions, an important criterion for the 

selection of targeted sites was their position in the target countries’ migration flows. Due to the seasonal 

migratory nature of pastoralists, the project’s benefits will not be limited to the project sites and their 

surroundings.  

Needs Assessment. Vulnerabilities and risks for the HoA have been assessed with the AR-5 (IPCC) and 

through Bank commissioned regional studies (Sustainable livestock Development in the HoA, 

Assessment and Management of Transboundary Water Resources in the IGAD, etc.). Various needs 

have also been identified through meeting and workshops with government officials and various 

stakeholders. 

Based on these assessments, the AfDB set in place a regional program called “Drought Resilience and 

Sustainable Livelihood Program” (DRSLP) which is currently being implemented to address drought 

and livelihood issues in the rural areas of the HoA. The proposed RLACC (II) program will be 

implemented to compliment the DRSLP.  

Bank’s Added Value. The Bank has significant experience in implementing multinational and regional 

operations, and is already implementing a set of programs covering various countries of greater Horn of 

Africa (Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Djibouti, South-Sudan and Sudan) and addressing issues 

with significant trans-boundary implications, notably, the DRSLP which is being implemented in 

successional phases 1, 2, 3, and 4). Furthermore, the Bank is experienced in implementing GEF projects 

in general and GEF climate change adaptation operations in particular. 

Lessons learnt from the Bank’s involvement in these countries were incorporated in the design of the 

current program. The Bank also brings into the programming a fragility lens approach, which makes the 

design, implementation and review of projects more sensitive to the drivers of fragility with the goal of 

building resilience in countries and communities.  



 

iv 
 

Knowledge Management. Knowledge management approach for the project focuses on learning from 

other relevant projects / programs and initiatives, and planning for the project to assess, document and 

share these experiences and expertise with relevant stakeholders. Different knowledge management 

activities will thus be implemented through the RLACC II projects  

The program will also work in close collaboration, and share its best practices and lessons learned, with 

all co-financing projects, as well as other GEF financed initiatives and other projects implemented by 

the Bank and in the region. 

At the regional level, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) will be in charge of 

sharing knowledge product elaborated by the RLACC II and RLACC I at the regional level to foster 

knowledge sharing and utilization. PIUs, which carry out the day-to-day implementation of the project’s 

activities, will be responsible for the mainstreaming of relevant information at the countries levels 

through the IGAD platform. At the regional level, this should result in dynamic and structured flows of 

information and knowledge between projects and within the RLACC programs in the HoA.

I. STRATEGIC THRUST & RATIONALE 

1.1 Programme linkages with countries and Horn of Africa (HoA) strategies and objectives 
 

1.1.1 The program is consistent with the principles of key regional initiative, policies and projects adopted 

by the governments of the participating countries, namely: (i) The Inter-Governmental Authority on 

Development (IGAD) Drought Disaster Resilience and Sustainability Initiative (IDDRSI)”; (ii) Regional 

Programming Paper (RPP, 2013) “To End Drought emergencies in The Horn of Africa” (2012); (iii) the new 

Sendai Framework for DRM (2015–2030), which contains the collective commitment of governments and the 

United Nations to work towards reducing societal vulnerability to disasters generally and stop drought in 

particular. The program also fits in the Bank’s new Regional Integration Strategy and Policy Paper (2014-

2023), the Bank’s Ten year Strategy (2013-22), the Bank’s Strategy for Addressing Fragility and Building 

Resilience in Africa (2014-19), and the recent High 5s vision of the Bank. At the national level, the RLACC 

program is in line with the participating countries strategies and priorities. Additional details on the strategic 

fit of RLACC in each country are given in the individual countries’ PARs. 

 

1.1.2 The program is fully aligned with National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) for Sudan and 

Somalia respectively approved in 2007 and 2013. In Sudan, the NAPA emphasizes the rural dimension of 

poverty in Sudan and focuses on three sectors: agriculture, water resources, and public health. By focusing on 

a wide range of interdependent technologies and methods such as the introduction of solar energy for 

communal services, e.g. for water pumping purposes, new irrigation methods for agriculture, rangeland 

rehabilitation and the introduction of veterinary services, the program fully reflects the priorities laid out in 

Sudan’s 2007 NAPA and strategic frameworks included in the revised Sudan National Adaptation Plan (2014).  

 

1.1.3 In Somalia, the NAPA has identified the urgent and immediate activities to address potential negative 

impacts of climate variability and climate change on people and their livelihoods within the context of recurrent 

famine crises and the national priorities over peace-building and economic recovery. Thus, the NAPA 

identifies the following sectors as vulnerable to climate change: water resources, agriculture and food security, 

animal husbandry, grazing and range-lands, health, marine and coastal resources, biodiversity and natural 

disasters. In that framework, the activities in Somalia within this program will focus on supporting pastoralist 

livelihoods and will therefore have a specific emphasis on livestock management, water and land resources 

management. 

 

1.1.4 In addition, both countries Intended National Determined Contribution (INDC) to the 21st Conference 

of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), published in 

November 2015, acknowledges that climatic as well as non-climatic factors such as ecosystems degradation, 

complex disasters and conflicts, limited access to capital, market infrastructure and technology, unsustainable 

management of natural resources, and socio-economic factors such as poverty, lack of income diversity, 

unequal distribution of income, urbanization, population growth, have all weakened people’s ability to adapt 

to changes in climate. These factors are well taken into account by the proposed activities under this program 

in order to build resilience to climate change in Somalia and Sudan.  

 

1.2 Rationale for Bank’s Involvement 
 

1.2.1 Incidences of climate change (CC) in the Horn of Africa (HoA), as assessed in the AR-5 published by 

the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2014) are: rising temperatures, rainfall 

variability, drought, desertification, deforestation and land degradation, floods and other extreme weather 

events (extreme precipitations, stronger El Niño, etc.)  Additionally, pastoral livelihoods in the ASALs of the 

HoA have been negatively affected by political marginalization, social exclusion, lack of good governance at 

all institutional levels, imbalanced power relations between the state and civil society, and gender inequality. 

These phenomena are the cradle for increasing vulnerability of rural pastoral and agro-pastoral communities 

in the region that rely the most on the environment for their livelihood. The resulting environmental migration 

is in turn causing, among others, competition for natural resources, ethnic tensions, and distrust between the 

original area of migration and the receiving areas. As both Somalia’s and Sudan’s resources are scarce, both 



 

2 
 

countries are prone to such kinds of conflicts. Consequently, taking into account the weight of the pastoralist 

activities and populations, increasing their resilience to climate change represents a vital issue for the HoA 

countries’ stability, economic recovery and future prospects.  

 

1.2.2 The proposed GEF funded project’s focus on climate change adaptation in the rural sector in Somalia 

and Sudan fills a vital missing gap in the pastoralist and agro-pastoralist sub-sectors in both countries which is 

not fully covered by DRSSLP and other partners and is urgently needed to support economic diversification 

in the context of climate change. Multiple feedback loops between severe drought occurrence and vulnerable 

livelihoods due to water scarcity and grasslands farming have led to competition over natural resources access 

between drought displaced households and transhumant pastoralists.  

 

1.2.3 As one of the most important multilateral institutions acting in Africa, the AfDB has an extensive 

experience in supporting and financing community based initiatives and projects in the continent. Investing in 

areas like agriculture, natural resources management and improving livelihoods are crucial for reducing 

poverty and vulnerability to climate change. The Strengthening of Climate Resilience in the Kafue Sub-Basin, 

in Zambia, or the Carla Climate Adaptation for Rural Livelihoods and Agriculture in Malawi are two of the 

many examples of projects financed by the Bank and designed to respond to the climate change effects, reduce 

poverty and enhance food security in some of the most vulnerable communities in the continent. The success 

of these projects shows the Bank’s competency and commitment to implementing climate change adaptation 

measures in the region, including the respective INDCs from the Paris agreement. Therefore, the Bank will 

continue playing a lead role in supporting the governments of both countries in achieving their objectives and 

implementing important measures to fight climate change effects and reduce poverty in Sudan and Somalia. 

 

1.2.4 The Multinational (Sudan and Somalia) rural livelihoods’ adaptation to climate change in the Horn of 

Africa – Phase II (RLACC II) is in alignment with the Bank’s priorities and strategies, which includes bringing 

growth that is not only environmentally sustainable, but also empowering. Indeed, the Bank’s Climate Change 

Action Plan to assist RMCs in implementing their NDCs and build mitigation and adaptation in Africa is one 

of the actions aligned with the project.  

 

1.2.5  The Project is fully aligned to one of the Bank’s Ten Year Strategy (TYS: 2013-2022) core areas of 

infrastructure and also to one area of special emphasis namely agriculture. The project also contributes to the 

High-5 priorities (2016-2025), namely the Feed Africa and Improve the Lives of Africans priorities. It will 

introduce climate-resilient water harvesting technologies, promote conservative agriculture practices, provide 

capacity building and training on sustainable resources management, and reduce food insecurity risk by 

diversifying the pastoral and agro-pastoral livelihood base of target communities. Moreover, the Project will 

improve rural people participation along the livestock value chain starting from production and processing to 

marketing. The project will thus promote both immediate and longer-term climate-resilient initiatives into 

pastoral livelihoods in arid and semi-arid areas (ASALs) of Sudan and Somalia while ensuring inclusiveness 

of rural men, women and youth as direct beneficiaries. The RLACC I and II activities complement those of 

the recently approved ‘Short Term Regional Emergency Response Project’ (STRERP). 

 

1.2.6 Given its focus on climate change adaptation, the project is fully aligned with the Bank’s Climate 

Change Action Plan 2 (CCAP2) and in particular with its pillar 1 “Boosting Adaptation and Climate-resilient 

Development in Africa”. As highlighted in the CCAP2, this project by focusing on resilient infrastructures and 

climate adaptation measures, demonstrates the Bank’s effort to leverage its internal resources to strengthen the 

adaptive capacities of countries by supporting the diversification of local economies. Indeed, building on the 

AfDB funded DSRLP, the GEF funding is mobilized by the Bank to build resilience in both countries in the 

agricultural and pastoral sub-sectors. 

  

1.2.7 Finally, the project addresses the programs identified under the Bank’s Somalia Country Brief (CB) 

(2017-2020) and well aligned with its objective to “Build longer term resilience in Somalia, through targeted 

support to the development of relevant infrastructure, institutional capacity, and skills”. Consequently, by 

enhancing pastoralist livelihoods, the project fits well with the CB pillar 1 which seeks to rebuild key 

infrastructure to enhance resilience and diversify livelihoods. The CB highlighted the importance of the 

agricultural sector in Somalia and in particular the livestock sector which contributes to more than 40% of 

national GDP. By tackling the issues related to climate change adaptation in this sector, this project will help 

build resilience with the adoption of adaptive measures combined with resilient infrastructures.

Baseline Project 
 

1.2.8 The baseline project for the proposed project is the Drought Resilience and Sustainable Livelihood 

Program (DRSLP), a multi-phased program running over 15 to 20 years. It targets the root causes of drought 

crises in the countries of the HoA, and its first phase was implemented in Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Kenya. 

Somalia and Sudan are both included in the second phase (DRSLP II). The baseline project was approved by 

the Bank’s Board of Directors in November 2014; and the project started in August 2015. Meanwhile, Sudan 

is covered through the third phase (DRSLP III) in June 2015. Following the same concept and using FEG 

Grant resources, RLACC I was approved in December 2016 covering Djibouti and Kenya to the tone of USD 

5.484 million for Djibouti and USD 2.784 million for Kenya. 

  

1.2.9 DRSLP focuses its intervention on building the necessary infrastructure for mobilizing and managing 

surface and ground water in the context of pastoral and agro-pastoral production systems. This consists of 

rangeland development and rehabilitation works, land development for crop production, and small water 

mobilization and supply infrastructure for crop and livestock production. In addition, the capacity building 

element of the DRSLP will focus its intervention on providing local communities and authorities with 

investments in infrastructure development and capacity strengthening.  

 

1.2.10 On the long run, the DRSLP is a response to the devastating climate change evidenced drought, 

environmental degradation, and poverty in the HoA’s vulnerable communities. However, the baseline alone 

does not sufficiently tackle certain issues related to climate change resilience and the sustainability of pastoral 

and agro-pastoral livelihoods. For instance, stakeholders are not fully involved in planning and decision-

making processes. Existing and planned activities under DRSLP II (in Somalia and Sudan) and DRSLP III (in 

Sudan) do not lead to the full integration of CC considerations in community development plans and sectoral 

policies, and climate hazards still need strengthened mitigation. Consequently, the RLACC II project aims at 

completing the activities of the baseline program on these key issues, and is in line with the ongoing RLACC 

I project in Djibouti and Kenya. 

 

1.2.11 Over decades, most interventions to address climate change issues (and especially drought) in the HoA 

have been of emergency humanitarian relief nature. Like the DRSLP (Baseline project), the RLACC II project 

seeks to be innovative as it proposes solutions to tackle this issue in a medium and long-term perspective, 

through an integrated approach that aims at improving water resource mobilization, rangeland management, 

livelihoods diversification, infrastructure for market access and building human and institutional capacity 

within a framework that is sensitive to conflict resolution and management.  

 

1.3 Aid coordination 
 

1.3.1 Regional and International organizations (Swiss Development Cooperation Agency, African Water 

Facility, etc.) are engaged in addressing climate change and livelihoods challenges in the region. However, it 

is noteworthy to mention that, in general, most Development Partners’ (DPs) interventions in CC are mainly 

short-term responses and humanitarian relief-focused.  

 

1.3.2 The Bank discussed with several Partners and donors to garner support for the program. In particular, 

the Bank is supporting the countries of the HoA to access GEF funds from the Least Developed Countries' 

Fund (LDCF) and the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) in order to finance the RLACC activities to 

complement the baseline program (DRSLP). During the appraisal mission, consultations were made with many 

relevant DPs including FAO, USAID, IFAD, UNDP and EU to ensure close coordination and harmonization 

of activities towards common goals and objectives of the RLACC. Generally speaking, the consultations 

helped avoiding overlaps and redundancies among the different interventions while funding by the different 

partners was done on an individual basis.

2.2 Project type 

 
RLACC – phase II is a multinational operation using the GEF-managed trust funds ‘Least Developing 

Countries Fund (LDCF)’. Both Sudan and Somalia are benefitting from LDCF resources through the GEF 

Focal Area 1 (Climate Change Adaptation) as grants. The GEF approved the Somalia project in December 13, 

20161 and the Sudan project in March, 2017)2.  As both Somalia and Sudan are under sanctions, the project 

interventions will be limited to technical assistance activities.  

 

2.3 Project cost and financing arrangements 

 
2.3.1 The total RLACC II cost is estimated at USD 17,067,592 (exclusive of tax and customs duty); entirely 

proposed for financing by the GEF from the Least Developed Country Fund (LDCF) to contribute to the 

implementation of the GEF climate change adaptation strategy (GEF focal area Climate Change Adaptation - 

CCA).  The grant amounts to USD 9,985,185 for Somalia and USD 7,082,407 for Sudan.

2.4 Project’s target area and population 

 
2.4.1 The project will cover two countries of the HoA, namely Sudan and Somalia, targeting rural pastoral 

and agro-pastoral communities highly vulnerable to climate change and affected by factors such as domestic 

and regional migration (transhumance practices, displacements due to conflicts or food insecurity) – all of 

which are drivers and consequences of environmental fragility. 

 

2.4.2 In Sudan, the project will be implemented in the project will be implemented in three States, 

respectively the White Nile State, the Gedaref State and the Kassala State. Targeted areas in the States are 

respectively: (i) White Nile State, Dueim Locality, Al Baja Reserve Pasture Area, (ii) Gedaref State, 

Gadambalia Locality, (iii) Kassala State, Aroma Locality, Togaly villages and Um Safari village. 

 

2.4.3 In Somalia, the project will intervene in localities selected in South Central Somalia, Somaliland and 

Puntland States. The targeted localities are: (i) South Central Somalia: Hiiraan and Galguduud States, 



 

8 
 

Localities of Beledweyn and Guriceel, (ii) Somaliland: Awdal region, villages of Quljeed, Ton and Salawley-

Cheikh Hared, (iii) Puntland: Bari and Nugaal regions,  

 

2.4.4 More details on the targeted area and communities are provided in the annexed specific countries’ 

reports. 

 

2.4.5 The RLACC II program is expected to increase targeted communities’ adaptive capacity and the 

resilience of their livelihoods to climate change through capacity building and the introduction of adaptation 

technologies, improved access to natural resources (especially water), and diversification of livelihoods. 

 

2.5 Participatory process for project identification, design and implementation 

 

2.5.1 The RLACC II program is intended to address the adaptation of rural pastoral and agro-pastoral 

communities to Climate Change (CC) and to reduce their vulnerabilities to CC induced hazards. During the 

project formulation, discussions and surveys were conducted with key stakeholders and beneficiaries, 

revealing the numerous constraints communities have faced, and their very diverse nature. Most of them are 

directly linked with CC and its various effects. Overseeing these various effects, CC hazards constitutes the 

common challenge for the HoA, as its devastating impacts on agriculture, livestock production, reduced terms 

of trade, household incomes, economic stability and governance. The many conflicts of political nature or over 

natural resources characterizing the regions were also identified as a driver of fragility. Specific country 

participatory processes conducted during project identification are provided in the countries’ PARs. The 

engagement of Community Based Organizations, Civil Society and other forms of collective initiatives are big 

success factors the implementation of the project. Sensitization and training sessions will be extensively 

conducted to make sure that the beneficiaries and their organizations are very well aware of their essential role 

as recipients and as participants of/in the project activities. Sensitization will target crucial topics such as 

management of pasture and water resources in a conflict free environment. In Sudan, a validation workshop 

with the stakeholders was organized to discuss the content of the project and to secure buy-in. I Somalia, due 

to the political Situation in the country, consultations were done in Hargeisa (Somaliland) and remotely with 

Puntland and Mogadishu. In addition, draft project documentation was also shared with the Governments of 

the two countries for their final review and comments. More consultations with relevant stakeholders will be 

conducted to confirm and prioritize activities prior to the onset of implementation.   

 

2.6 Bank Group experience, lessons reflected in project design 

 
2.6.1 The Bank’s long standing experience in the design and implementation of Climate Change (especially 

drought resilience and water infrastructure development) was capitalized and mainstreamed in the design of 

this project. The Bank experience lies on previous similar multinational project addressing specific climate 

change issues in the HoA, such as the DRSLP program, and collaboration with other institutions and regional 

initiatives (IGAD, COMESA, NEPAD, CAADP, etc.)  

 

2.6.2 The Bank’s strategy on ending fragility and building resilience stresses the importance of better design 

of projects in countries facing fragility, to build resilience, through more inclusive growth and development. 

To this end, the Bank now requires a fragility lens application in each project, which has been undertaken in 

annex 5 attached. 

 

2.6.3 While the experience of the Bank in the area of Drought Resilience is not a long one, the team was 

able to tap into whatever the available information in terms of implementation challenges and ways to address 

them. The RLACC II is building on the achievements, successes and lessons of former and current initiatives 

such as the DRSLP. The aim is to enhance the effectiveness of RLAC II by resorting to swifter and closer to 



 

9 
 

the ground operational units in comparison to IGAD implementation model with a Fund Management Unit 

hosted in IGAD Secretariat in the case of DRSLP.  The DRSLP has established mechanisms to enhance the 

availability of infrastructure for natural resources management (water and pastures) at the regional level (given 

the mobility of pastoralists across borders) and ensuring stability of the environment as well as the harmonious 

sharing of the resources in a sustainable manner. The current project was inspired by the first countries 

benefiting from the project such as Djibouti and Kenya. The key activities included developing water storage 

and other related infrastructures, development of market infrastructure and communication and information 

systems in pastoral rural areas; optimizing potential value chains and strengthen regional trade and; enhancing 

community participation in the management of water, pasture and livestock marketing. The project will also 

build on existing initiatives and policies to develop better collaboration and information exchange, rather than 

creating new costly systems. A brief description of the ongoing portfolio in Somalia and Sudan is given 

respectively in annexe 3 and annexe 4 at the end of this report.   

2.7 Key performance indicators 
 

2.7.1 The project aims at enhancing pastoralists, livelihoods through climate change resilient infrastructures. 

The progress toward achieving this objective will be measured through different key performance indicators 

at the impact, outcomes and output levels. At the impact level, the indicators used will be based on the increase 

of agricultural production in the target areas, resulting in the reduction of food insecurity, measured by national 

surveys and reports. 

 

2.7.2 For the outcome, the measure will be made through: (i) the development/use of methods, policies and 

frameworks mainstreaming Climate Change issues, (ii) number of communities adopting the adaptive 

measures (iii) the percentage of women participating in specific activities. In terms of outputs, the indicators 

will include: (i) number of people trained, (ii) the number of study tours and workshops, (iii) the number of 

knowledge products and the degree of execution of the project.  

 

2.7.3 While national data collection will be under the responsibility of the countries projects, a monitoring 

and evaluation expert at IGAD, working in close collaboration with the country level PIUs and other key 

partners, will be responsible for feeding the data provided to him into the existing Drought Resilience platform 

at the secretariat. The M&E specialist at IGAD will work with the country level M&E specialists to harmonize 

the data collection format. The information generated will be disseminated to other projects’ communities and 

potential users in the region.  

 

 

III.  PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1.  Economic and financial performance 

 
FIRR (base case) 17% NPV value at 12% is USD 1.71 million 

EIRR (base case) 23% NPV value at 12% is USD 2.19 million 

 

3.1.1 Somalia and Sudan are both included in the second phase of DRSLP II. The implementation of these 

projects will first enable a better carbon sequestration. The improving of water resource mobilization, through 

the building of boreholes, haffirs and other water infrastructures, and the introduction of new climate resilient 

practices, such as drought resilient seeds, will benefit communities in having better crop productivity, and thus, 

boost their economic growth. This process will enable a reduction of conflicts, especially about resources 

availability. Moreover, the introduction of sustainable land management with activities of reseeding and re-

plantation will also have an important impact on reducing natural resources scarcity and poverty, lessening 

soil erosion and increasing soil fertility. Providing veterinary services and training for communities about new 



 

10 
 

climate resilient practices will improve food security and benefit for the whole regions in reducing conflicts 

and migrations. 

 

3.1.2 The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of the project is calculated at 21%, the net present value 

(VPV) is estimated at USD 1.71 million. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the project is estimated 

at 25% and the net present value (NPV) at 12% opportunity cost of capital is estimated at USD 2.19 million. 

 

3.1.3 The project will have both direct and indirect benefits. Improved livelihoods for the agro-pastoral 

communities will be the main direct benefit. The emphasis on a multi-level, integrated approach to pastoral 

development through support and funding for a range of initiatives will help pastoralist communities and 

households undertake livestock and non-livestock related income generating activities, accompanied by 

awareness raising, information and capacity building.  

 

3.1.4 A parallel dynamic of social inclusion and economic growth will help reintegrate the most vulnerable 

and marginalized population categories into the local economy and combat the social and economic 

marginalization in which many pastoral groups are trapped. For instance, the creation of new boreholes and 

water supply networks in villages will reduce periods of unemployment/inactivity due to lack of irrigation 

boosting economic growth at the village level and improving villagers’ livelihoods. Farmers’ income is 

expected to increase from better crop productivity as a result of sustainable irrigation schemes and the 

introduction of new adaptive practices and appropriate technological package into crop production. 

 

3.1.5 Additional programme benefits include an increased value of livestock through the setting up of 

veterinarian services, thus further improving food security, and reducing vulnerability to external shocks such 

as animal disease outbreaks. The efforts of the project to provide micro financing will benefit to pastoralists 

and agro-pastoralists to diversify their sources of livelihoods.   

 

3.1.6 National economies and regional integration will also benefit from the program. Effective cooperation 

in the management of water resources and improved rangeland management would reduce conflicts and 

promote social stability and strengthen regional integration. The development of market infrastructures and 

the improvement of the delivery of animal health related services, mainly the prevention and control of TADs 

will contribute to an increase of intra- and extra-regional safe trade in livestock products. 

 

3.1.7 The methodology used to estimate these project benefits is based on a costs benefits analysis. Indeed, 

assessing the costs and benefits of a program is of essential importance to meaningfully quantify its impacts. 

Following the GEF approach, a baseline model is required, in this case the DRSLP II and III project. The 

global environmental benefits and the incremental costs, and besides, the project impacts, are compared to the 

baseline project without the support of the GEF. This implies in concrete terms an analysis of the situation 

with and without the additional GEF funded project. This analysis was conducted for each country, Somalia 

and Sudan, in order to assess the economic and financial performances of the country projects.

3.2 Environmental and social aspects 

Environmental aspects 

 
3.2.1 The project focuses on building capacity on a country (ies) – wide adaptation intervention to climate 

change aimed at improving the resilience of communities and agro-pastoral communities, their livelihoods and 

their production systems. The project will have major positive impacts on the environment: (i) improved 

management of natural resources (water and land) at local, State, national and regional level, (ii) improved 

resilience of the ecosystems with the introduction of drought-resistant plants for shelterbelt around villages or 

for agriculture and (iii) rehabilitation of rangelands. In light of these benefits, the project is proposed for 

category 3. 

 

3.2.2 An environmental and social review has been made, based on the potential environmental and social 

effects of the project, and prior to the undertaking of any formal, activity-related and/or site-specific 

Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs). As the project will be funded by the GEF through the 

AfDB, all works must comply with the due environmental and social assessment process, when required either 

by regulation or AfDB, as well as with the recommendations of the upcoming ESIAs (in case further 

environmental and social studies are performed), including compliance with the appropriate avoidance, 

management and mitigation measures. The extent of activity- and site-specific ESIAs will be assessed by the 

AfDB and key national institutions/institutional partners when site location as well as activity parameters (size 

of infrastructures, characteristics of each resilient culture, etc.) are formalized. The review identifies minor 

risks to environment and social issues (referred to as “effects”) from activities in their general form and outlines 

strategies for managing those risks and minimizing undesirable environmental and social impacts. National 

institutions will be ultimately responsible for the supervision of the environmental and social matters, with the 

AfDB providing updates on the adequacy and respect of measures. The supervising entities and/or experts will 

ensure timely remedial actions are taken by the contractor where necessary. 

 

Climate change aspects 

 
3.2.3 As an adaptation programme, it will reduce pastoral and agro-pastoral communities’ vulnerability to 

CC induced hazards through campaigns, workshops and trainings aiming at raising stakeholders’ awareness 

on this issue. In addition, the project’s support to the diversification of the sources of income will provide the 

beneficiary communities with the necessary cushion for the shocks stemming from the CC. The 

implementation of diverse infrastructures solutions and the adoption of new techniques should also have a 

positive impact, increasing communities’ resilience. Furthermore, since the Bank’s Climate Change Action 

Plan is to assist RMCs in implementing their NDCs and build mitigation and adaptation in Africa, the funding 

for this project is totally in accordance with climate adaptation finance. 

Social aspects 

 
3.2.4 The RLACC II program will have a major positive impact on social aspect at community, regional and 

national level. Indeed, the program will (i) reduce the scarcity of natural resources and its related pretension 

to conflicts; (ii) the diversification of livelihoods – mostly at women’s benefit – will contribute to increase 

households’ incomes and wealth, (iv) the improvement of the population health, (v) the improvement of market 

access will strengthen inter-communities linkages and reduce conflict or distrust issues.  

 

Gender aspects 

 
3.2.5 The proposed project has an important focus on women and gender equality. Indeed, many activities 

focus on women empowerment and capacity-building, from awareness raising activities, to the introduction of 

adaptive techniques and training. The implementation of adaptive techniques (output 2.1.1.) is not gender-



 

12 
 

specific, but the objective is clearly to improve the climate resilience for communities for specific economic 

sectors (mainly agriculture and livestock husbandry), as climate change has a significant impact on 

communities, mostly women and children. Also, adaptive technologies will contribute to reducing workload 

experienced by women and children, who are often the groups charged with water collection for households 

and livestock.  

 

3.2.6 In addition, the output 2.1.2 is designed to train communities and targeted groups to the use of 

techniques and technologies introduced with output 2.1.1. Women are clearly the main focus of this output, as 

most of its activities are targeting women. In order to achieve target number of women, it is advised that women 

organizations in pastoral communities are targeted. Finally, the outcome 2.2 seeks to diversify income-

generating activities, which is expected to have a strong impact on women empowerment. Indeed, the activities 

suggested should reduce rural women’s domestic workload through labour-saving technologies. By reducing 

women’s workload, the project will empower the women beneficiaries in achieving a more equitable balance 

in workload and in the sharing of economic and social benefits.   

 

3.2.7 Furthermore, additional indicators not mentioned in the logical framework, such as the number of 

management committees, access to education for girls, access to land and credit opportunities, access to smart 

seeds and crops and access to equipment could be added or at least considered. 

 

Involuntary resettlement 

 
3.2.8 The implementation of this project does not imply any involuntary resettlement or limiting access to 

natural resources.  

 

IV. IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1 Implementation arrangements 

 

4.1.1 For Somalia, all fiduciary responsibilities will be handled by IGAD’s Fund Management Unit (FMU) 

that is implementing the DRSLP II in coordination with the Bank. To this end, a tri-partite Protocol of 

agreement will be signed between the Bank, IGAD and the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) to describe 

in detail the implementing arrangements. IGAD’s capacity has been strengthened through the establishment 

of the FMU to implement the DRSLP II in Somalia and Sudan. The FMU is composed of a Coordinator, an 

Accountant, a Procurement Expert, and an Administrative assistant. The FMU has gained experience and 

knowledge through the management of the on-going DRSLP II and the coordination of the several 

interventions in the country. However, in order to match the anticipated additional workload (given that FMU 

is handling the DRLSP II – Somalia and Sudan projects and the recently approved STRERP) and also improve 

the quality of reporting within the FMU, a dedicated Project Technical Team (PTT) will be recruited 

competitively from the region composed of a Team Leader with expertise in Climate Change Adaptation and 

project management and four Experts (an expert in Adaptation to Climate Change, an expert in M&E and  

Community Mobilization, an Accountant and a procurement specialist). The PTT will be responsible for the 

day to day supervision of project activities in Somalia and will report to the FMU. On the ground activities 

will be implemented through focal points in the line Ministries (Ministry of Environment and Ministry of 

Agriculture / Livestock in South Central Somalia, Puntland and Somaliland). The IGAD will be responsible 

for the recruitment process of RLACC II PTT. The choice of the FMU-IGAD as a partner in managing the 

RLACC II, came from the fact that the IGAD through the FMU is coordinating the DRSLP in Somalia and for 

which RLACC II is a supplementary funding and therefore overall coordination and synergy will be ensured 

with the involvement of the FMU. The RLACC II will make the provisions needed for the key operating 

expenses at the IGAD Secretariat. Considering the multinational dimension of RLACC II, the FMU-IGAD 

will assist the implementation units in the sense of mobilizing and disseminate the M&E data through the 

regional platform already set up by the IGAD to make it accessible to the RLACC I and II participating 

countries, the Horn of Africa region and the Drought Resilience Knowledge Community at large. In each State, 

National Project Steering Committee will provide strategic direction (policy guidance and review of project 

progress) and approve annual work plans and budget of the project. It will also examine the various project 

activities, through inputs provided by the FMU/PTT. It is chaired by the Ministry of Environment, and consists 

of representatives of the Federal Government of Somalia and of the established autonomous States’ 



 

13 
 

Governments (including representatives from other ministries, etc.), the civil society and other relevant 

stakeholders. 

 

4.1.2 In Sudan, the Executing Agency is the Higher Council for Environment and Natural Resources 

(HCENR) - Ministry of Environment. In order to guarantee a successful implementation of the project, a 

Project Implementation Unit (PIU) for RLCC II should be established with key experts (an Expert in 

Adaptation to Climate Change – National Coordinator, an Expert in M&E, an Expert in mobilization for 

Community-based Adaptation, a procurement specialist and an accountant). These experts will be nationals 

recruited competitively creating a light PIU to be housed in the Higher Council for Environment and Natural 

Resources (HCENR) - Ministry of Environment that will be responsible for the day-to-day implementation of 

the project activities, including fiduciary affairs. Three State Coordinators will need to be seconded by State 

Governments from ministries relevant to environment to facilitate implementation at State levels. For 

coordination purposes RLACC II PIU should work in harmony with the DRSLP coordination unit at federal 

and state levels. A National Project Steering Committee (PSC) will be established to provide strategic direction 

(policy guidance and review of project progresses) and approve annual work plans and budget of the project. 

The PSC will be chaired by the Ministry of Environment at federal level, and consists of representatives of 

ministries of Finance, Electricity and Water (represented by Drinking Water and Sanitation Unit), Animal 

Wealth, Agriculture and Forestry and representative of the three States government (White Nile, Gedaref and 

Kassala). The Project Coordinator will serve as the rapporteur for the PSC, which will examine the various 

project activities and represent the organ of key project decisions. As part of regional coordination 

responsibility in the drought resilience projects and initiatives, RLACC II PIU should grant the flow of M&E 

information to IGAD Secretariat (through the FMU) to enable coordination of the overall tracking of the agreed 

performance indicators in the region.  

 

4.2 Procurement arrangements 
 

All procurement of goods and works and acquisition of consulting services financed by the Bank will 

be in accordance with the Bank’s Procurement Policy for Bank Group Funded Operations dated October 2015 

as revised from time to time, using the relevant Bank Standard Bidding and Request for Proposals Documents. 

The summary procurement arrangements for the two countries is provided the table below. The detailed 

procurement arrangements for each country are given in their respective PARs.

4.3 Financial Management Arrangements and Disbursement 

 

4.3.1 The financial management (FM) operations of the Sudan component of the Project will be 

carried out under the overall direction of the Accounting Officer of the Ministry of Environment, the 

Executing Agency (EA). The financial transactions of the project will be initiated, processed, 

recorded and reported in accordance with the country’s Financial and Accounting Act (2007), and the 

Financial and Accounting Regulations (2011) as well as the Bank’s FM Guidelines. To facilitate FM 

in the project, a local professional Accountant with relevant qualifications and level of experience 

acceptable to the Bank including proficiency in English, will be competitively recruited by the EA 

and will be part of the PIU that will be established prior to grant effectiveness. 
 

4.3.2 In regard to the Somalia Component, the FM system (including budgeting, accounting, funds 

flow, internal controls, financial reporting and audit arrangements) that is being followed under 

DRLSP II will apply to the Project. The IGAD Secretariat, through the existing Fund Management 

Unit (FMU) will be responsible for the FM and will be carried out in accordance with the recently 

developed DRLSP FM Manual and the Bank’s FM Guidelines. The FM capacity within the FMU 

will benefit from the recruitment of a project dedicated accountant in the RLACC II PTT, with 

qualifications and experience acceptable to the Bank.  

 

4.3.3 The PIU (for the Sudan) and the FMU (for the Somalia component) will be responsible for 

accounting, reporting, funds flow, banking arrangements, internal controls and audit arrangements 

and reporting for the activities carried out at both the federal and state levels. The PIU and FMU will 

be required to produce quarterly interim financial reports (IFRs) for the project, which will be 

submitted to the Bank no later than forty-five days after the end of each quarter. Annual Project 

specific financial statements (PFSs) will be prepared in accordance with the Generally Accepted 



 

15 
 

Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the Sudan and the IFRS (for the Somalia component) which will 

be submitted to the auditors within three (3) months following the closure of every financial year. 

The project audits for the Sudan component will be conducted by the National Audit Chamber (NAC), 

or a competitively recruited private audit firm to be appointed by NAC based on the Bank’s Standard 

Audit Terms of Reference. In the case of the Somalia component, the audits will be carried out by 

private audit firm to be appointed by IGAD, based on the Bank’s Standard Audit Terms of Reference. 

The audit reports, complete with a Management Letters, will be submitted to the Bank not later than 

six months after the end of the financial year.  The cost of the audits will be paid from the respective 

grants, if carried out by private audit firms. 

 

4.3.4 In regard to disbursements under the Somalia Grant, resources will be disbursed through the 

Intergovernmental Authority on Development Secretariat (IGAD).  To this end, IGAD will be 

responsible for preparing and submitting disbursement requests to the Bank for payment.  Transfer 

of funds the FGS and the participating States will follow the fund transfer system already in place 

under the DRLSP II and IGAD will retain the fiduciary responsibility for such transfer.  On the other 

hand, the disbursements under the Grant to the Republic of Sudan will be under the responsibility of 

the Higher Council for Environment and Natural Resources (HCENR), the Executing Agency. The 

project will use mainly the direct payment and the Special Account methods for disbursements. The 

Bank’s Disbursement Letter for each Grant shall be issued stipulating key disbursement procedures 

and practices. With regard to the SA method of disbursement, Government of Sudan and IGAD (as 

the Implementing Agency for Somalia) will each open a Project Special Account at the Central Bank 

(for the Sudan) or a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank (for IGAD) to receive funds. The 

opening of the Project Special Accounts will be a condition for the first disbursement of the Grants 

to the respective Recipients. 

 

4.4 Governance 

 
4.4.1 Somalia and Sudan, and at a wider level the HoA, have been affected by a chronic cycle of poverty, 

instability and conflict over natural resources. Challenges commonly faced by all the countries of the region 

are weak governance, conflict prevention, nomadic pastoralists, food security and resource sharing.  

 

4.4.2 IGAD has become a central part of the political and security architecture of the HoA. It focuses 

particularly on regional governance and integration, through the promotion of responsible leadership at local, 

national and regional levels, and the introduction of anti-corruption measures; also on the efficient management 

of the natural resources, food security, border control and non-proliferation of small arms. The project 

integrates specific measures to mitigate governance risk to ensure that resources are used judiciously and for 

the purposes for which they are intended. In this regard, the project will provide assistance in procurement and 

financial management to the various executing agencies and Implementing Units. The project will coordinate 

its efforts with Bank and non-Bank ongoing interventions in the region dealing with capacity building of public 

institutions, CBOs, NGOs and IGAD, as well as recipient communities on which the project implementation 

depends. Indeed, the recipient communities’ appropriation of the project are essential to its implementation 

and its dynamic in time. It is also considered that the project will evolve throughout time by being in contact 

with communities. Their solicitation, mobilization and engagement is therefore essential right from the start 

of the project. 

 

4.5 Sustainability 

 
4.5.1 During the project preparatory stages, the choice of rangeland rehabilitation, veterinary, and water 

infrastructures and capacity building were the results of a consensus over technical discussions held during the 

project identification, preparation and appraisal stages. The project activities are community-driven and 

government facilitated. The beneficiaries, men and women, have been consulted all along the design process 



 

16 
 

of the project. Their continued involvement at implementation and monitoring of project progress and 

achievements will increase the sense of ownership and responsibility, and will lead to the sustainability of the 

investments. Cost sharing and cost recovery mechanisms will be taught to the target communities and used 

whenever possible to further promote investment sustainability. Communities will also be responsible for the 

management and maintenance of the constructed/rehabilitated infrastructure. To this end, communities’ 

sensitization and mobilization campaigns will be conducted from the onset of the project implementation.

  

4.5.2 The investments made by the Program in the area of trade, value addition of existing activities and 

diversification of income will promote the linkage between production and the market and facilitates access to 

production inputs and related services while improving the livelihoods of men and women headed households. 

This will be a major contribution to enhancing the interest and commitment of the different actors and 

stakeholders of the project. 

 

4.5.3 The LDCF program will be complementary to the DRSLP by mainstreaming climate change 

adaptation into its capacity-building component. In order to achieve this, the LDCF program will mobilize 

communities and strengthen their capacity to ensure sustainable implementation and management of 

infrastructure. This complementarity between the DRSLP and the LDCF programs where the former will focus 

on primary infrastructure and the latter on its sustainable operation and management with a focus on integrating 

climate change will ensure the sustainability of the overall intervention. 

 

4.5.4  Lastly, as the project’s implementation is based on numerous preparatory stages and lessons learned 

from other programs or projects done in both countries, the project deliverables should outlive the initial phase 

due to the engaged mobilization efforts at grass root level (communities) and the sustained commitment of the 

trained policy makers to project objectives and approaches. Given, the limited opportunities for work in the 

country, it is expected that the trained personnel and staff in the government will remain even after the project 

is completed. This provides an additional comfort to the sustainability concerns.  

 

4.6 Risk Management 

 
Table 6: Project Risks and Mitigation Measures 

 

Risks Mitigation measures 

Sectoral development policies and programs 

promote the settlement of migratory pastoralist, 

affecting negatively pastoralist adaptation 

strategies 

Training and policy development will have an 

integrated approach, highlighting the interaction of 

multiple dimensions, and emphasizing the migratory 

issue. Diversification of livelihoods of pastoralist and 

agro-pastoralists communities must be promoted as a 

coping measure.  

The cost of livestock-related infrastructure 

investment may become very high in relation to 

the very low sedentary livestock inventory due to 

high seasonal mobility of pastoral groups. 

The siting of infrastructure will be planned along the 

corridors so that it also caters for the needs of the 

transhumant pastoralists.  

 

Investments will have long-term positive impacts on 

sedentary and transhumant pastoralists. Both groups 

will be sensitized to share the maintenance load of 

infrastructure as they also share their benefits.  

 

The design of the infrastructure will be made simple so 

that the maintenance cost will be kept at a reasonable 

level.  

Poor coordination and cooperation among key 

national institutions dealing with pastoralists and 

agro-pastoralists issues 

Training and coordination of stakeholders on this issue 

in order to foster coordination and cooperation  



 

17 
 

Risks Mitigation measures 

Conflict between pastoralists and sedentary 

farmers as well as among different pastoral 

groups 

Promotion of dialogue and conflict resolution 

mechanisms with a community, regional or national-

level approach, in order to broaden perspective and 

visions. 

Inadequate acknowledgement of the role of the 

civil society and CBOs by national and local 

governments 

Training and sensitization of officials on the importance 

of civil society and CBOs during the resilience-building 

process. 

 

 

4.7. Knowledge building 

 
Working with the Executing Agencies and the Implementation Units, IGAD will be in charge of mobilizing 

and sharing knowledge product elaborated across countries to foster efficiency and improve implementation. 

The Project Implementation Unit, which carries out the day-to-day implementation of the project’s activities, 

will be responsible for the mainstreaming of relevant information provided through the IGAD and providing 

the coordination agency with knowledge products. At the wider level, this should result in dynamic and 

structured flows of information and knowledge between projects and within the RLACC program in the Horn 

of Africa.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Program Overview 

1.1 More than 160 million Africans (about one in four Africans) are food insecure and 

malnourished, making Africa the most food-insecure region in the world. More than 32 million African 

children under five are underweight, of which nearly 10 million are severely underweight, and 14.3 

million are wasted, with low weight for their height. Africa’s recent economic gains are at risk if this is 

allowed to continue.  Low agricultural productivity and value addition are at the heart of the 

malnutrition, employment and income challenges on the continent. The agricultural sector accounts for 

between 50 and 70% of employment in African countries, but produces only 25% of Africa’s Gross 

Domestic Product (GDP). 

1.2  Asia was in a similar position in the 1960s but 20th century scientific advances in agriculture 

developed by a number of International Agricultural Research Centers (IARCs) in Latin America and 

Asia were applied, leading to the Asian “green revolution”. These centers became the Consultative 

Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) and together with countries in Asia they 

catalyzed one of the greatest increases in food production and improved nutritional well-being such as 

the world has ever known. Today, the technologies exist to feed Africa, if widely deployed. They include 

high yielding crop varieties and livestock breeds, bio-fortified crops such as pro-vitamin A rich cassava, 

high iron and zinc rice, and high zinc sorghum, which if scaled up can help address the problems of 

malnutrition and stunting of African bodies and minds. Africa has more food production technologies 

available today than Asia had at the time of its green revolution. What is missing is taking these 

technologies to farmers at scale. Also missing has been a well-coordinated food production technology 

delivery platform to help address all of the related issues of extension (training), policy, market, 

institutional, R&D, and regulatory issues hindering the widespread use of technologies. 

1.3  The Bank seeks to focus the technically excellent but hitherto uncoordinated efforts of CGIAR 

and their work with National Agricultural Research and Extension Systems (NARES), in particular as 

represented by their continental umbrella, the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA) and 

Sub-Regional Organizations (SROs). The result will be a Regional Technology Delivery Infrastructure 

(RTDI), with emphasis on agro-ecological zones and their priority commodities that will reach 40-50% 

of all African farmers with the most relevant food production technologies by 2025. The overall goal of 

TAAT is to radically improve agriculture as a business across Africa by deploying agricultural 

productivity-increasing technologies within eight Priority Intervention Areas (PIAs): i) Self-sufficiency 

in Rice Production, ii) Cassava Intensification, iii) Food and Nutrition Security in the Sahel, iv) 

Transforming African Savannahs into Breadbaskets, v) Revitalizing Tree Plantations, vi) Expanding 

Horticulture, vii) Increasing Africa’s Wheat Production, and viii) Achieving Self-sufficiency in Inland 

Fish Production. Within these PIAs, nine (9) agricultural commodities are prioritized. TAAT is designed 

as a Framework Program that allows partners (the World Bank, AGRA, BMGF, IFAD, etc.) to 

contribute resources and to expand country coverage over time. The Bank’s PY1 funding will be UA 

29 MILLION (US$ 40 MILLION) in grants to finance the centrally managed activities (for ADF-only 

countries while partner resources will initially target ADB countries). Similar amounts will be sought 

for PY2 and PY3. Further, the Bank is expected to provide close to US$350 million through its normal 

country lending programs, beyond the central activities, towards areas that will support development of 

agricultural value chains, market and infrastructure and access to finance, all of which will bolster the 

success of agricultural transformations at the country level. 

1.4 And while TAAT is a key platform for driving the Feed Africa strategy of the Bank, the 

resources needed to achieve the objectives of Feed Africa are huge and well beyond what could be 

achieved alone. So the Bank is developing strategic alliances and partnerships to help mobilize resources 

to achieve the objectives. TAAT is planned as a multi-donor financing platform to help take proven 

agricultural technologies to scale across Africa. The fundamental guiding principles of TAAT are: 

technology matters; scale matters; the policy and regulatory environment matters; and partnerships 

matter. 



 

iv 

1.5 A successful green revolution in Africa must be inclusive and based on a recognition that 

agricultural transformation and women’s empowerment are inextricably linked.  Addressing the gender 

disparities that persist in African agriculture presents a tremendous opportunity to unlock the potential 

of African agriculture. The agricultural sector in Africa is the largest employer of women; 62% of 

economically active women are working in the sector, while in countries such as Rwanda, Malawi and 

Burkina Faso, over 90% of economically active women are involved in agricultural activities. Yet 

depending on the country, the rural wage gap between men and women in Africa is estimated at between 

15-60%.  Research also indicates that women farmers are just as efficient as male farmers when granted 

equal access to inputs and skills.  TAATwill systematically incorporate consideration for gender 

equality and ensure women’s equal access to agricultural technologies..  For TAAT will prioritize the 

needs of women to level the playing field and increase agricultural productivity to achieve impact.  

1.6 TAAT is a strategic alliance with the goal of mobilizing $1 billion towards its goal of scaling 

up agricultural technologies. The Bank and the World Bank have been working actively together on 

conceptualizing TAAT for the past close to two years. The World Bank initially planned to put US$500 

million towards TAAT partnership in countries, an amount it announced would be increased to $700 

million during the multi donor discussion on the planned initiative during the World Food Prize events 

in Des Moines, Iowa in October 2017. The other members of the TAAT alliance will include the Bill 

and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Alliance for a Green Revolution in 

Africa (AGRA), all of whom have committed significant resources. Indeed, the Bill and Melinda Gates 

Foundation has already approved its financing support to the TAAT central coordinating platform 

housed at IITA, which will be described below. 

1.7 Other institutions have been actively participating in TAAT's conceptualization, including the 

Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the International Fund for Agricultural 

Development, Agence Française de Development, DFID, USAID and other bilateral institutions and 

the private sector. Several of these institutions expect to collaborate on TAAT and also to co-finance 

national level interventions through parallel financing. It is worth noting that at the World Food Prize 

events in Iowa, which brought together the world's leading agriculture experts, TAAT was seen as 

potentially the "most significant effort to pull resources together to deliver technologies at scale across 

agroecological zones to farmers in Africa".  

1.8 TAAT aligns with the twin objectives of the Bank’s Ten Year Strategy (TYS), inclusive growth 

and transition to green growth, with agriculture as one of the three areas of special emphasis. It also 

resonates with four of the Bank’s five corporate priorities (Feed Africa, Industrialize Africa, Integrate 

Africa and Improve the quality of lives of Africans), encapsulated in the High 5s. In addition, TAAT is 

strongly anchored on the Feed Africa agenda, endorsed by African leaders at the High-Level Conference 

held in Dakar in October 2015, which itself was anchored on the African Union’s Malabo Declaration, 

as well as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1 and 2 of eradicating extreme poverty and ending 

hunger and malnutrition. Given the agro-ecological perspective of the PIAs, TAAT contributes to the 

Regional Integration Policy and strategy (2014-2023) and is aligned with the transition states strategy 

in applicable RMCs of the Bank. TAAT is also anchored around previous projects supported by the 

Bank, namely: i) the “Support to Agricultural Research for Development of Strategic Crops in Africa” 

(SARD-SC), which funded research on four of the six strategic crops of the African Union (Cassava, 

Maize, Rice and Wheat), following a value chain approach; ii) the project to deploy the New Rice for 

Africa (NERICA) in seven African countries – a project that won the U.S. Treasury award in 2014; iii) 

the project on the Promotion of Science and Technology for Agricultural Development in Africa 

(PSTAD) implemented in 34 RMCs; and iv) various research-for-development projects (in Cameroon, 

Tanzania, and other countries) that contributed some of the proven agricultural development 

technologies selected for deployment in TAAT. 

1.9 Knowledge gained from implementation of prior agricultural research operations and other 

regional projects, particularly on the need to build country capacity for project implementation and 

delivery, has been taken into consideration in the design of TAAT. Similarly, the knowledge generated 



 

v 

from TAAT will be used to design, manage, and implement similar Bank-financed projects in the future. 

Through M&E, knowledge related data will be collected throughout implementation. Data will be 

analyzed and the results used to improve project implementation in real time. 

1.10 All African countries are eligible to participate in TAAT based upon a commitment to enact 

policies that facilitate the uptake of food production technologies, strengthen National Agriculture 

Research and Extension Systems (NARES), and participate in activities agreed upon with the CGIAR 

consortiums and Sub-Regional Organizations (SROs) under TAAT. They will be supported through 

centrally managed technology deployment compacts or country programs in which the Bank 

collaborates with partners (e.g., WB, AGRA, BMGF, and IFAD) to incorporate TAAT components into 

agricultural value chain development programs. The TAAT program consists of four major components 

namely: i) the creation of an enabling environment for deployment and adoption of food production 

technology by famers, in particular vibrant seed systems or artificial insemination programs, technology 

release and registration policies that are regionally harmonized, and regional programs to combat pest 

and disease threats; ii) a Regional Technology Delivery Infrastructure (RTDI)—a consortium of CGIAR 

centers, NARES, and SROs. These form the TAAT platform, which is able to provide and deploy 

needed food production technologies and any additional adaptive research required; iii) deployment of 

appropriate food production technologies, through crop/livestock campaigns in RMCs; and iv) project 

management. 

1.11 Operationally, TAAT will function as follows: The Regional Technology Delivery 

Infrastructure (RTDI) made up of CGIAR centers and other technology providers, will develop a menu 

of proven food production technologies in nine priority commodities. These include seed systems or 

artificial insemination programs for best bet crop varieties/livestock breeds for large scale deployment; 

protocols for disease control on a regional basis; farmer education in improved crop/animal production 

methods; aquaculture, etc.  RMCs, as represented by NARES, will work with the CGIAR centers to 

prepare proposals, based on the menu of food production technologies, for outreach campaigns;  the 

proposals will be submitted to the decision-making body of the RTDI, the Clearinghouse (details in 

Appendix 1).  Once proposals are approved, funds will be released for execution but the Clearing house 

will continue to provide oversight during execution. TAAT is not a research program but takes food 

production technologies that exist—the result of decades of research efforts—to millions of farmers via 

crop/livestock outreach campaigns and the creation of an enabling environment working with the 

researchers themselves. 

1.12 The food production technologies to be deployed under TAAT have the features of Regional 

Public Goods (RPGs) namely: (i) non-rivalry, (ii) non-exclusivity, (iii) broad public interest and benefit, 

(iv) strong alignment with the Bank’s strategic orientation and continental and regional objectives; (v) 

catalytic and upstream role, and (vi) higher developmental impact through cooperation. Food production 

technologies being deployed will be available to all stakeholders in the target agro-ecological zones or 

commodity belts for free. No country will be excluded. Key related lessons learned will include the 

stronger working relationships between the CGIAR centers and NARES, and the experience in working 

across multiple countries with similar agro-ecological zones, among others. 

1.13 TAAT will allow donors to work together through a well-coordinated regional technology 

delivery platform, for appropriate technologies to be deployed to millions of farmers across Agro-

ecological zones. It will bring to bear the joint collective effort of international, regional and national 

agricultural systems to improve connections between research and extension and reform regulatory 

systems that impede speedy transfer of technologies across borders..  

1.14 By going to scale on the Priority Intervention Areas (PIAs), TAAT’s key benefits include (i) 

increased agricultural productivity and diversification, leading to improved food and nutrition security, 

(ii) job creation through expanded commercialization and industrialization, (iii) improved 

socioeconomic status of farmers including women and youth due to higher incomes, (iv) reduced 

vulnerabilities to market price fluctuations due to reliable supply leading to better organized markets, 



 

vi 

(v) improved soil, land and water management practices due to Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs), 

and (vi) increased resilience to climate variability and stress through the deployment of Climate Smart 

Agriculture (CSA) technologies and innovations. TAAT will make a significant contribution to Feed 

Africa’s key agricultural development objectives, which are 1) eliminating extreme poverty, 2) ending 

hunger and malnutrition, and 3) achieving food self-sufficiency and turning Africa into a net food 

exporter. 

1.15 Projections based upon overall project design and assumptions developed for the larger Feed 

Africa strategy, as well as World Bank and AGRA programs, suggest that TAAT, by scaling up food 

production technologies, will result in 120 million tons of additional raw food production per year, will 

assist about 40 million beneficiaries (11.7 million households), and lead to increased food production 

valued at $1.7 to $2.8 billion resulting from an $850 million investment by the end of the program.. 

Investments in TAAT will be greatly compounded by larger loans/grants awarded to RMCs through 

Feed Africa.  

1.16 Management hereby seeks Board approval for the first year resources (PY1) from the Regional 

Public Good (RPG) window and will return in subsequent years (PY2 and PY3) with further requests and 
also for specific country programs.

1. INTRODUCTION 

1.1 Africa’s Agricultural Sector is Underperforming 

1.1.1 The African continent has enormous potential for agricultural production. Yet more than 160 

million Africans are food insecure and malnourished. This is about one in four Africans, making Africa 

the most food-insecure region in the world. Every day over 100 million children in Africa go to bed 

hungry with devastating long-term consequences on their physical and mental development, hobbling 

their productivity as adults. Indeed, this has led to 58 million stunted African children—short in height 

for their age—representing an increase of 23% since 1990, despite worldwide declines of 37% over the 

same period. More than 32 million African children under five are underweight, of which nearly 10 

million are severely underweight, and 14.3 million are wasted, with low weight for their height. Simply 

put, more than a third of African children under five are either moderately or severely underweight. 

Africa’s recent economic gains are at risk if this is allowed to continue. 

1.1.2 Related to health and nutrition concerns, low agricultural productivity and value addition are 

very much at the heart of employment and income challenges on the continent. The agricultural sector 

accounts for between 50 and 70% of employment in African countries, but produces only 25%, of 

Africa’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Consequently, many people work in agriculture for their 

livelihoods and yet produce and earn very little for it. Furthermore, less than 30% of harvests are 

processed into value added products compared to 98% in developed countries. Only $40 of value is 

added to one ton of processed products in Africa compared to $180 in rich countries. These are missed 

opportunities to create wealth and employment, especially for women who predominate in the 

population of African farmers today (70–80% of African farmers are women). This places women and 

their families in precarious situations, exacerbating the health and nutrition challenges already 

described. To escape this negative feedback loop, increasing agricultural productivity and value addition 

is key. The interventions described here address productivity issues while other measures being rolled 

out within the Bank’s Feed Africa strategy work on improving value addition.   

1.1.3  Why is productivity so low in Africa? For a variety of reasons including poor soils and limited 

access by smallholder farmers to improved crop varieties and livestock breeds, fertilizer, soil 

correctives, and appropriate crop production packages. African staple crop yields have barely grown in 

the last 25 years, and remain the lowest of any region in the world. The productivity of five staple 

crops—rice, wheat, maize, potato, and cassava—is just over half of the international average. Annual 

growth of cereal yields was only 1.3% from 1990 to 2014, compared with 4.1% in Brazil during the 

same period. Strikingly, between 2001 and 2008, agricultural GDP in Africa grew at just 3.4% while 

overall GDP grew nearly twice as fast, at 6% annually.   

1.1.4  In sum, the underperformance of the African agriculture sector leads to low incomes and 

expensive and often poor quality food, which has a direct bearing on hunger, malnutrition, poverty, and 

human capital and which hinders economic opportunities in the farm and non-farm sectors alike.   

1.2 Asia’s Green Revolution was the result of Technological and Institutional  Innovations 

1.2.1 Asia’s experience illustrates how rapidly things can turn around with the right actions at a 

critical time. In the mid-1960s in Asia, rising populations, an underperforming agricultural sector, and 

consecutive droughts led to significant food shortages, widespread hunger, and malnutrition. However, 

through spectacular scientific advances in wheat and rice breeding and agronomy, the food crisis was 

rolled back and India became food secure within four years, by 1970; Pakistan, Thailand, the Philippines 

and Bangladesh followed soon after. The Asian agricultural phenomenon is estimated to have saved a 

billion lives and is now known as the ‘Green Revolution’. 

 



 

2 

1.2.2  The Asian experience was inspired by earlier successes in Latin America. The 20th century 

scientific advances in agriculture that were so successfully applied in Asia had been developed by the 

Mexican Agricultural Cooperation Program for wheat, established by the Rockefeller Foundation in 

Mexico City in the 1950s, and by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) for rice, created by 

the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations in Los Banos, Philippines, in the 1960s. This was south-south 

learning at its best. 

1.2.3  And indeed this south-south learning was deliberately supported by global development 

partners at the time. The World Bank, from the late sixties to the early eighties, provided institutional 

innovations to deploy and adapt the wheat and rice agricultural technologies to millions of hectares of 

farmlands in Asia. The World Bank also facilitated the establishment of public institutions at global, 

regional and country levels combined with policy advice and support to Asian countries, to implement 

a far-sighted strategy of reaching resource-limited farmers with the best of modern agricultural 

technology. One of these is the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), a 

global network of agricultural R&D institutions, established in 1972. The CGIAR centers were set up 

to be international centers of excellence in agricultural innovation, where cutting edge crop and 

livestock technologies were developed by the world’s best scientists and tested and adapted to individual 

country conditions, in collaboration with the National Agricultural Research and Extensions Systems 

(NARES). NARES are made up of national agricultural research institutes, universities, public and 

private extension (training) agencies, farmer organizations, etc., representing the national voices and 

approaches to agricultural technology development and deployment. It is safe to say that the Asian 

Green Revolution would not have happened without heavy investments by the World Bank, the 

Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, and Asian governments in agricultural research and development, 

credit, input distribution, extension, and rural infrastructure. On average, Asian governments doubled 

their own spending on agriculture between 1972 and 1985. 

1.2.4  The Rockefeller and Ford Foundations expanded International Agricultural Research Centers 

(IARCs) to Africa in the late 1960s—with the first center being the International Institute for Tropical 

Agriculture (IITA), established in Ibadan, Nigeria in 1967 to tackle technological barriers to raising 

food production. In the 1980s, two other centers were established in Kenya: the International Livestock 

Research Institute (ILRI) and the International Center Agroforestry Research (ICRAF, presently 

referred to as “World Agroforestry Center”); as well as a fourth center, the Africa Rice Center in Cote 

d’Ivoire. Of the 15 centers, four are based on the African continent. Centers in Asia and Latin America 

also opened research stations in Africa in the 1980s, including the Wheat and Maize Research Center 

in Mexico (CIMMYT) and the Tropical Crops Center (CIAT), demonstrating the increasing interest of 

international donors to bring the research and the technology for a green revolution to Africa.  

1.3 Why technologies have not moved to scale before in Africa 

1.3.1  But Africa missed the first green revolution for several reasons. Technologies have not moved 

to scale before in Africa due to: i) weak agricultural extension systems, ii) poor linkages between 

research and extension, iii) long technology verification and release systems, iv) a focus on national 

boundaries instead of across agro-ecological zones, v) insufficient attention to private sector value 

chains, vi) poor market linkages, vii) weak policy and regulatory environments, and viii) the absence  

of a regionally coordinated effort to deliver technologies across similar Agro-ecological zones 

(technologies without borders). 

1.3.2  Africa’s internal borders pose a serious challenge to the spread of technology on the continent. 

New agricultural technologies spread slowly across Africa’s agro-ecological zones because they are 

partitioned into multiple countries with differing governments, languages, phytosanitary controls and 

seed-certification processes. At the same time, pests and diseases do not respect arbitrarily drawn 

political borders and easily spread across them. This creates a deadly mismatch between prevailing 

dangers and the ability to roll out technologies to stop them in their tracks. The Fall Armyworm is a 

good example of such a pest that travels quickly and wreaks destruction on entire crops in its path. The 



 

3 

Armyworm was spotted for the first time in northern Nigeria in 2016 and has already managed to spread 

to at least 40 African countries (see Appendix 3 for a description of the Fall Army Worm Problem and 

mitigation plan led by the Bank). Tragically this is a crisis with known scientific solutions in the US 

and Brazil to stop the pests in their path, but without mechanisms to rapidly deliver them to African 

fields. And this is but one example. 

1.3.3  Low public sector investment in agriculture, poor seed systems, weak public extension, and 

lack of a harmonized regional legal framework for registration of crop varieties, and animal breeders’ 

rights (intellectual property), have meant that even existing improved varieties and breeds do not get 

into the hands of most farmers within a country or across a region. The share of acreage planted using 

improved crop varieties is only 30% in Africa compared with more than 50% in Latin America and 

more than 80% in Asia. Improved livestock breeds are even less prevalent.  

1.3.4  Investment by governments in the agriculture sector has also been a key driver of Green 

Revolutions in other regions. Mindful of this, African governments came together in 2003 to agree on 

the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Program (CAADP), which, among other things, 

called for African countries to spend 10% of their budgets on agriculture. Yet, to date, only a handful 

of countries have managed to meet this target, hindering the resources available to support the transfer 

of new agricultural technologies into and within Africa. 

1.4 Feed Africa: AfDB’s Initiative to Drive Africa’s Green Revolution 

Feed Africa is the Bank’s bold initiative to end hunger, malnutrition, extreme poverty, and food 

imports—currently estimated at US$35 billion and projected to rise to US$110 billion by 2025, if 

nothing is done. This is a massive challenge as well as a massive opportunity. Feed Africa takes a 

commodity value chain approach to developing agriculture in Africa. A guiding principle of the Feed 

Africa Initiative is treating agriculture as a business, rather than as a way of life, and ensuring the 

inclusivity of women and young people. The goal is to produce thriving small-, medium-, and large-

scale agribusinesses in every segment of commodity value chains on the continent. Therefore, for Feed 

Africa to succeed, it must do two things. First, it must significantly raise agricultural productivity. 

Second, it must move African production much higher on the value chain, with agribusinesses 

producing and selling processed goods, not simply basic commodities, while providing markets for 

African farmers. The TAAT initiative aims to achieve the first goal, while a number of other initiatives, 

notably the development of agropoles and well-functioning markets, focus on the second. TAAT is 

therefore the bedrock of Feed Africa.  

1.5 Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT)  

1.5.1  Similar to Asia, enhancing Africa’s productivity requires significantly increased investment 

from African governments, businesses and development institutions to deploy  proven 21st century food 

production technologies to tens of millions of African farmers where they will have the most impact. 

These food production technologies already exist and include new high yield crop and livestock 

varieties,  micro-nutrient dense crops – for example, pro-vitamin A rich orange-fleshed sweet potato 

and high iron beans, drought tolerant maize varieties, integrated pest and disease management (IPDM), 

and simple storage and post-harvest technologies to reduce crop losses.   

1.5.2  The potential of these food production  technologies to provide food and nutrition security has 

been demonstrated and needs to be taken to scale.  For example, DroughtTEGO® is a trademark for a 

high yielding drought-tolerant maize variety developed by the Water Efficient Maize for Africa 

(WEMA) Project to mitigate against drought stress. Experts predict that with global changes Sub Sharan 

Africa will be disproportionately affected by drought and suffer a 30% decrease in yields.  Kenyan 

farmers who grew the WEMA varieties during the drought of 2016 obtained 3.6MT/Ha of maize 

compared to 1.5MT/Ha in fields of farmers who grew other commercial hybrids. In addition, it has been 

demonstrated that 125g of orange fleshed sweet potatoes (OFSP) can provide the daily provitamin A 



 

4 

needs of a preschooler. Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD) is a significant health concern in Africa 

contributing to high rates of blindness, disease and premature death in children and pregnant women.  

An estimated 43 million children under 5 years are Vitamin A deficient and  between 50,000 and 

125,000 of those vitamin A-deficient children go blind every year, half of them dying within 12 months 

of losing their sight.   

1.5.3  A major target of TAAT is the control of the Fall Army Worm  (FAW), a recent pest problem 

on the continent that currently puts at risk an estimated 13.5 million tons of maize valued at US$ 3 

billion in the 2017/2018 season.  This assessment is from research funded by the Department for 

International Development (DFID) at the Center for Agriculture and Biosciences Intenational (CABI) 

that assessed current and potential damage of the Fall Army Worm  (FAW).    Based on the 

aforementioned research findings, DFID requested the leadership of the African Development Bank to 

contain the serious problem of Fall Army Worm (FAW). Following, the Bank hosted a meeting of 

experts at the recent World Food Prize symposium in Des Moines, Iowa; in attendance were Center for 

Agriculture and Biosciences Intenational (CABI), USAID, the International Center for Improvement of 

Wheat and Maize (CIMMYT, the Spanish acronym), the International Center for Insect Physiology and 

Ecology (ICIPE), and the private sector.   The meeting recommended a regional approach,  awareness 

raising campaigns, scouting and early detection, 1Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM), and 

search for resistance in preferred varieties.  TAAT will tackle Fall Army Worm (FAW) based on these 

recommendations working with CABI, ICIPIE, CIMMYT, National Agriculture Research and 

Extension Systems (NARES) of RMCs, regional and Sub-Regional Organizations, and R&D Centers.  

1.5.4  Simple storage and post-harvest technologies being to reduce crop losses and help farmers 

manage the increased harvest under TAAT include: hermetic grain storage (Purdue Improved Crops 

Storage system) that prevent pest and mycotoxins infection of stored grains.  Other post-harvest 

technologies include affordable and efficient grain drying, and low cost extruders for production of 

simple processed food by small and medium scale agribusinesses.    

1.5.5  Crop campaigns to reach farmers with agricultural technologies of inputs and extension have 

occurred in Africa with significant success in the past.  Over a four-year period, 2011-2015, Nigeria, 

working closely with Africa Rice, the rice CGIAR center in Africa, combined innovative (ICT-based) 

ways to deploy improved rice production technology of seeds and fertilizer, a value chain approach, and 

supportive public policies to reach 6 million rice farmers. Average yields in the country doubled from 

2MT/Ha to over 4MT/Ha and national paddy rice production rose by an additional 7 million MT. 

1.5.6  Similarly, in Malawi, delivery of subsidized seeds of improved maize varieties and fertilizer to 

millions of farmers in 2004 made the country self-sufficient in maize production and a net exporter of 

maize in a single season. Ethiopia’s national extension system also deployed new crop technologies to 

over 4.4 million smallholder farmers from 2010 to 2015 on nearly 2.2 million hectares of land. Since 

then, Ethiopia’s agriculture sector has enjoyed an average growth rate of over 7% per year, which has 

contributed in no small way to the double digit annual growth rate of the economy overall. 

1.5.7  The approach to scaling technologies has been based on national boundaries, instead of agro-

ecological zones across multiple countries. The releases of crop varieties often go through four years of 

testing in national contexts, which has to be replicated across countries within the same agro-ecological 

zone in which the same technology can make a difference. Thus, a technology that is good fit for a given 

agro-ecological zone of ten countries could take 40 years to reach farmers if deployment from country 

to country spreads one after the other. What is needed is a new approach that will cut back on these 

unnecessary regulatory bottlenecks and fast track the release of technologies across similar agro-

ecological zones in one go. This is what TAAT will do. This will help open up the regional seed industry 

and markets and lead to faster uptake of technologies. 

                                                           
1 1  Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM) optiones  include resistant germplasm, pesticides, biopesticides, botanicals, pheromones, 

biocontrol via natural enemies, etc. 



 

5 

1.5.8. TAAT will engage  Regional Technology Delivery Infrastructure (RTDI) - of CGIAR centers 

and other technology providers to develop a menu of proven food production technologies working with 

National Agricultural Research and Extension Systems (NARES), Sub-Regional Organizations (SROs) 

and the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA), the umbrella body of NARES in Africa. 

Based on the menu of proven food production technologies, RMCs, as represented by NARES, will 

work with the CGIAR centers to prepare proposals for food technology outreach campaigns across 

similar agro-ecological zones that cut across multiple countries to the decision making body of the 

RTDI, the Clearinghouse (see details in Appendix 1). There are eight Priority Intervention Areas (PIA) 

of TAAT that are agro-ecology based and cover 18 priority commodities (see Appendix 2).  But for this 

phase, nine food production technologies have been prioritized because of potential impact to increase 

food security, combat malnutrition, reduce food imports, and improve livelihoods.  They include: Water 

Efficient Maize for Africa (WEMA), high yielding rice varieties adapted to Africa (the NERICA 

varieties), high-yielding and high-starch cassava varieties, high yielding sorghum and millet for the 

Sahel, orange fleshed sweet potatoes, high iron beans, small livestock (goat and sheep), aquaculture, 

and new wheat varieties.  Control of pests and diseases, for example the Fall Army Worm (FAW), is a 

cross cutting intervention across all nine technologies.  

1.5.9  While TAAT is not a research program to develop new technologies—for the most part the 

needed technologies already exist and in some cases are already in use—but rather a crop and livestock 

outreach campaign to disseminate best-bet crop varieties/livestock breeds and practices to the farmers, 

it requires a close partnership with National Agricultural Research and Extension Systems (NARES) 

and International R&D Centers to provide solutions that tend to arise as research is deployed over a 

wide range of similar but diverse agro-ecologies with unique micro-ecosystems. 

1.6 TAAT will carry out positive gender discrimination in favor of women 

1.6.1 A successful green revolution must be inclusive and based on a recognition that Africa’s 

agricultural transformation and women’s empowerment are inextricably linked. Addressing the gender 

disparities that persist in African agriculture presents a tremendous opportunity to unlock the potential 

of African agriculture with the World Bank cautioning that “failure to recognise the different roles of 

men and women in agriculture is costly, resulting in misguided projects and programmes, forgone 

agricultural output and incomes, and food and nutrition insecurity”.  Indeed incorporating consideration 

for gender issues systematically in agricultural research, development, and extension systems will 

contribute significantly to meeting the food needs of Africa’s growing population and ensure that 

productivity gains in food systems translate to improved welfare of the poor. 

1.6.2 Women are important to Africa’s agriculture and agriculture is important to African women’s 

lives. The agricultural sector is the largest employer of African women, with 62% of economically 

active women working in the sector.  In countries such as Rwanda, Malawi and Burkina Faso, over 90% 

of economically active women are involved in agricultural activities.  Despite being heavily engaged in 

agriculture, African women earn less than men from the sector with the rural wage gap between men 

and women estimated at between 15-60%. In the case of Ivorian cocoa and Ethiopian coffee, for 

example, women provide 68% and 75% of the labour, respectively, but earn only earn 21% and 34% of 

the income generated. 

1.6.3 Research indicates that, when granted equal access to inputs and skills, women farmers are just 

as efficient as male farmers. Hence the privileging of male farmers, for example in Ivorian rice projects, 

is based on erroneous assumptions not supported by data. As such, gender responsiveness in agricultural 

research and development is not about ‘fixing the women farmers’, but rather addressing the 

institutional structures and technological impediments that hamper their productivity. Ultimately, the 

empowerment of women farmers requires institutional transformation, with research institutions 

becoming more gender responsive and paying close attention and genuinely responding to the needs of 

women farmers 



 

6 

1.6.4 In partnership with African Women in Agricultural Research and Development (AWARD), 

the Bank will systematically incorporate consideration for gender equality and ensure women’s equal 

access to agricultural technologies. In this regard, AWARD will support TAAT by: (i) Convening and 

coordinating a network of technical gender experts that would be available to members of the TAAT 

consortium to address issues of gender in the selected value chains which will maximize the impact of 

TAAT by providing consolidated gender expertise and opportunity for shared learning; (ii) Identifying 

and prequalifying bankable and scalable agricultural research and development innovations that address 

the gender gap in African agriculture and build relationships with private sector and other uptakers of 

gender responsive agricultural technologies.  Expected outcomes will be demonstrated change in in 

gender awareness, attitudes and/or behaviours of TAAT partners, a measurable increase in TAAT 

partner institutions with gender responsive agricultural innovation policies and strategies, and TAAT 

outputs that are gender responsive across value chains. 

1.7 Expected Impact of TAAT 

1.7.1. TAAT interventions are projected to raise productivity and increase food production over the 

next 8-10 years (Table 2). TAAT will add an estimated 120 million MT of food to Africa’s food 

production valued at US$1.71 to US$2.8 billion (Table 2).

3 Kg 5 Kg 5 million 

 

1.7.2  TAAT will benefit, through improved food security and income, an estimated 11.7 million 

households (representing on average 40 million people) over ten years, reducing by as many as a third 

the total number of hungry people on the continent. The increased food production is also expected to 

have an effect on food prices, reducing the amount of food households spend on food, and further 

increasing access to more food. It is estimated that TAAT, including its Bank-financed Country 

programs, combined with the affiliated programs of the World Bank and AGRA, will contribute to 

lifting about 40 million people out of poverty. 

1.7.3  TAAT will help to create huge regional spill-over effects and Regional Public Goods (RPGs). 

Of particular importance are RPGs that target imminent “regional public threats” of destructive pests 

and diseases of crops/livestock that do not respect political borders and easily spread across them.  A 

good example is the recent invasion into Africa of the Fall Armyworm described above, which currently 

puts at risk an estimated 13.5 million tons of maize valued at US$ 3 billion in the 2017/2018 season.   

1.8 TAAT is a Regional Program Producing Regional Public Goods (RPGs) 

1.8.1  TAAT resources are targeted at facilitating effective functioning of the Regional Technology 

Delivery Infrastructure (RTDI), made up of International Agriculture Research Centers of the 

Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), National Agricultural Research 

and Extension Systems (NARES), African Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF), Sub-Regional 

Organizations, all  non-governmental organizations, that will ensure that proven agricultural 

development technologies are rapidly deployed to RMCs. 



 

7 

1.8.2  TAAT aims at producing Regional Public Goods (RPGs), including: i) harmonized regional 

and Transnational border protocols for introduction and release of improved varieties/breed and other 

agricultural technologies, ii) Synchronization of seed system protocols, especially those that deal with 

liberalization of foundation seed production (to include private sector seed companies), iii) combatting 

“regional public threats” of destructive pests and diseases of crops/livestock that do not respect political 

borders and easily spread across them.   

1.8.3  The requested grant from the RPG window of ADF 14 will support CGIAR and low-income 

RMCs to drive delivery of food productions technologies into hands of at least 60% of all farmers after 

eight to ten years. Twenty two of these RMCs, namely: Benin, Burkina-Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Congo 

DRC, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, 

Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia have written to the Bank to 

express interest in participating. Six of them (Chad, Congo DRC, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Sierra Leone, 

and Sudan) are in fragile situations as defined by the eligibility for the Transition Support Facility (TSF) 

support under ADF-14. However, it should be noted that TAAT will produce Regional Public Goods 

(RPGs) of public interest; no RMC can be excluded from it or from their spillover benefits, given their 

public goods characteristics (see section 4.2 and Appendix 4). TAAT is therefore not exclusive to low-

income ADF RMCs. Non-ADF countries interested in TAAT such as Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia 

(ADB countries that have written to express interest in TAAT) are welcome to participate via  the ADB 

funding window of the Bank or other eligible partner funds (e.g., funds from BMGF and World Bank). 

Participation will simply depend on the ability of RMCs to meet requirements for technology 

deployment. For the 25 countries (22 ADF and 3 ADB) that have expressed interest in participating in 

TAAT, the country programs in the pipeline that are aligned to inserting a TAAT component are listed 

in Appendix 5. TAAT is therefore open to all RMCs, via their NARES, to make their best technologies 

accessible to farmers within countries working in close collaboration with regional and continental 

organizations. The new crop varieties and livestock breeds, cross-boundary crop and livestock diseases 

control (e.g., Fall Armyworm), crop management practices, knowledge and other products from the 

CGIAR’s research work are indeed RPGs made widely available to individuals and organizations 

working for sustainable agricultural development around the world. TAAT will be held to high 

standards of deployment and must meet clear key performance indicators or funding will be 

discontinued to erring institutions. 

1.9 TAAT will benefit from the lessons learned from previous Bank interventions  

1.9.1  The Bank’s earlier experience with the “Support to Agricultural Research for Development of 

Strategic Crops in Africa” (SARD-SC) program – which funded research on four of the six strategic 

crops of the African Union (Cassava, Maize, Rice and Wheat) – provides crucial lessons that TAAT 

will build upon.  They include: i) experience on how to work regionally with international centers of 

excellence (the CGIAR) to rapidly introduce and test technologies across a region for optimal yields 

and eventual deployment to farmers; ii) The SARD-SC program revealed the importance of going to 

scale to ramp up food production and reduce imports.  TheSARD-SC program led to a doubling of 

yields for wheat, rice, maize, cassava on experimental fields and in on-farm trials; if average wheat 

yields increases from 1.5 to 3MT/Ha and higher tons per hectare could be replicated across 9.8 million 

hectares grown in Africa, the continent could be on the path to self-sufficiency in wheat production; iii) 

SARD-SC also demonstrated the advantages of working across multiple countries with similar 

agriculture-ecological zones, simultaneously introducing, testing and releasing new crop varieties in 

several countries at the same time. Other lessons are have been learned from the development of the 

NERICA (New Rice for Africa) rice varieties by AfricaRice in the 1990s (Appendix 6). 

1.10 The Value-Added of TAAT 

1.10.1  The value-added of TAAT is that it can leverage crop and livestock technologies that have 

been developed and validated in one or a few countries across entire agro-ecological zones covering 

many countries. For example, maize yields can be doubled across East and Southern Africa via an 



 

8 

introduction, registration, and deployment of already available drought tolerant Water Efficient Maize 

for Africa (WEMA) varieties. And perhaps the best demonstration of the value added of TAAT is in 

tackling pests and diseases such as Fall Armyworm accross an entire region.   

1.10.2 TAAT will allow donors to work together through a well-coordinated regional technology 

delivery platform, for appropriate technologies to be deployed to millions of farmers across Agro-

ecological zones. It will bring to bear the joint collective effort of international, regional and national 

agricultural systems to improve connections between research and extension and reform regulatory 

systems that impede the speedy transfer of technologies across borders. 

2 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION 

2.1 Objectives of TAAT 

The development objective of TAAT is to "rapidly expand access of smallholder farmers, majority 

women, to high yielding agricultural technologies to improve their food production, assure food security 

and raise rural incomes, and deliver regional public goods by scaling up agricultural technologies across 

similar agro-ecological zones". Overall TAAT has three main objectives:  

i) Creating an enabling environment for technology adoption by famers via policies for 
deployment and adoption of food production technologies that are regionally 

harmonized, food and nutrition conscious, and environmentally sustainable; 

ii) Facilitate effective delivery of technologies to farmers by working with existing Regional 
Technology Delivery Infrastructure in a compact with RMCs, represented by NARES, 

private sector actors, and an independent technology Clearinghouse; 

iii) Raising agricultural production and productivity through the identification and 
deployment of appropriate technologies, including nutrient dense crop varieties, and 

vigorous crop outreach campaigns, extension, and market linkage campaigns, in RMCs. 

2.2 Strategy of TAAT 

2.2.1  Feed Africa takes a value chain approach to raising crop/livestock productivity in Africa. 

Figure 1 shows where TAAT will intervene in the commodity value chains. A commodity value chain 

is described as a series of goods and services required for a commodity to be produced and then to move 

from the place of its primary production to the ultimate end-user (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Positioning of TAAT within agricultural commodity value chains  

 

2.2.2  Agricultural growth that has occurred in Africa reveals that productivity enhancement and 

market access development are prevalent factors. Productivity unaccompanied by strong growth in 

markets leads to a glut from over-production, while markets without increased productivity gives rise 

to food imports due to insufficient supply. Feed Africa will work to reinforce these productivity aspects 

of the value chain and agriculture markets through its various initiatives such as TAAT, Agropoles, 

post-harvest losses and agro processing. The role of TAAT in particular is to improve outcomes at the 

beginning of this chain by increasing productivity, as well as resilience to weather and disease-related 

risks, providing a much more solid basis from which to build strong production systems and markets 

that make African agribusinesses successful. TAAT will work in concert with the other initiatives to 

foster the deployment of commercially viable technologies with improved access to input and output 

markets, and other enablers such as innovative finance and soft/hard infrastructure.  

2.2.3 It is important for TAAT to generate ‘quick wins’ to create credibility and attract both 

additional public and private sector financing. An initial set of priority agricultural commodities are: 

i) Water Efficient Maize for Africa (WEMA), 

ii) Import-quality rice for the west African lowlands, 

iii) Cassava for industrial use, 

iv) Small livestock (goats and sheep), 

v) Sorghum/millet for the Sahel, 

vi) Aquaculture 

vii) High yielding wheat varieties 

viii) Orange fleshed Vitamin A rich sweet potato varieties 

ix) High iron beans varieties for Africa 



 

10 

Management of pests and disease is a cross cutting theme across all the nine technologies 

2.2.4 Clear metrics of target productivity, production, beneficiaries, agro-ecologies, and countries have 

been pre-determined for these nine priority food production technologies (See Appendix 7) 

2.3 TAAT Activities 

2.3.1  The TAAT program consists of four major components namely: 

i) Component #1: Creation of an enabling environment for technology adoption by famers 
via a seed system, technology release and registration policies that are regionally 

harmonized 

ii) Component #2: A Regional Technology Delivery Infrastructure (RTDI)—or TAAT 
platform—that is able to provide and deploy needed food production technologies and any 
additional adaptive research required 

iii) Component #3: Deployment of appropriate food production technologies, through 
crop/livestock campaigns in RMCs 

iv) Component #4: Project Management. 

2.3.2  Harmonization of technology release and registration, and seed system, policies 

 across regions 

The approach to scaling technologies based on national boundaries needs to be replaced by an approach 

that involves agro-ecological zones that spread across multiple countries. Policies and protocols for 

release and registration of crop varieties and animal breeds needs to be streamlined so that 

varieties/breeds released in one country can be utilized in other countries of the same region, same with 

seed system protocols that can replicated across countries within the same agro-ecological zone. TAAT, 

working with Sub-Regional Organizations (SROs) and CGIAR center responsible for policy work, 

IFPRI (and its key partners such as the Africa Technology Policy Studies ATPS Network), will review 

national and regional policies on variety release, registration, and the seed system with an aim of 

harmonizing them to fast track the release of technologies across similar agro-ecological zones. This 

will help open up the regional seed industry and markets and lead to faster uptake of technologies. 

2.3.3. The Regional Technology Delivery Infrastructure (RTDI)—or TAAT platform 

RTDI is a consortium of CGIAR centers, FARA, Africa Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF) and 

SROs working on regional approaches to deployment of new crop and livestock technologies, and 

combatting pest and disease threats through a fair and transparent method in prioritizing technologies 

and allocating resources. The RTDI will develop a menu of food production technologies and work with 

RMCs, as represented by NARES and the private sector, to develop a proposal to take these technologies 

to scale.  Figure 2 schematically describes the RTDI processes. The RTDI is made up of four units, 

namely: 

1. A Project Steering Committee (PSC): the highest decision-making body composed of 
representatives of participating RMCs, the private sector, CGIAR centers. The 

committee provides oversight to Regional Technology Delivery Infrastructure (RTDI).  

2. Clearinghouse: the body of the consortium that decides on which technologies should 
be used. The Clearinghouse will be independent of the Project Management Unit (PMU);  

3. Commodity Technology Delivery Compact (CTDC): is at the core of TAAT and it is 
an agreement among the entire ecosystem of actors needed to deliver improved 



 

11 

technologies at scale for a specific crop or livestock value chain, for each of the priority 

commodities. They will be hosted the CGIAR center or institution with the particular 

mandate for each specific crop; 

4. A Project Management Unit: oversees day-to-day implementation of project fiduciary 
and administrative activities;  

2.3.4  Identification and deployment of appropriate technologies, through crop/livestock 

campaigns in RMCs 

TAAT will engage CGIAR and other technology providers to develop a menu of proven food production 

technologies, namely: seed system or artificial insemination guidelines (technical manuals) for large 

scale deployment of improved varieties/breeds, disease control, improved crop/animal production 

methods, aquaculture, etc.  RMCs, as represented by NARES, will prepare a proposed food technology 

outreach campaign covering one or more of the menu items, with support from the respective CTDC 

for submission to the Clearinghouse of the RTDI. The proposals will clearly state the target 

beneficiaries, location, development impact, and timelines within the RMCs. The Clearinghouse will 

review the proposals according to a set of agreed criteria and recommendations for funding. Oversight 

will also be provided for implementation by the Clearing house. 

 

Figure 2: Process of origination, review, decision making, and funding in the Regional Technology 

Delivery Infrastructure 

2.4 Expected Output and Outcomes 

2.4.1 Expected Outputs 

TAAT interventions are projected to raise productivity of target commodity up to 100% over the next 

8-10 years (Table 2). Other outputs include reduction of Vitamin A deficiency in children under five 

and pregnant women by 30% and reduction in post-harvest losses by 50% in target locations of TAAT 

over the next 8-10 years. 



 

12 

2.4.2 Provision of Regional Public Goods (RPG)  

Regional public goods will be provided via a number of vehicles including: 

i) Harmonization of regional and transnational border protocols for introduction and 
release of improved varieties/breed and other agricultural technologies 

ii) Synchronization of seed system protocols, especially those that deal with production of 
foundation seeds (inclusion of private sector seed companies) 

iii) Disease control – monitoring and IPDM methods 

iv) Extensive adaptation trials of crop varieties across the region, including nutrient dense 
varieties 

2.4.3 Crop Outreach Campaigns to reach millions of African Farmers 

i) Toolkits for the different priority commodities provided to the RMCs 

ii) Feedback on performance of technologies via the RTDIs 

iii) A doubling of acreage under improved crops and breeds, from the current 30% to 60%, 
by 2025 

iv) Availability of cheap and nutritious food 

2.4.4 Expected Outcomes 

TAAT will benefit via increased food security and income, raising farmer’s household incomes by an 

average of US$600 per annum, reaching an estimated 11.7 million households, representing on average 

40 million people, over ten years, and reducing by as much as a third the total number of hungry people 

on the continent. TAAT will add an estimated 120 million MT of food to Africa’s food production 

valued at US$1.71 to US$2.8 billion (Table 2).  The increased food production will also have an effect 

on food prices, reducing the amount households spend on food, and further increasing access to more 

food, in a positive feedback loop. TAAT is expected to add 3.15 million direct farm jobs over eight 

years. 

2.5 Costs and Financing Arrangements  

2.5.1 Program Cost  

TAAT is divided into centrally managed activities, designed to produce regional public goods, and 

funded by grants from the Bank and partners, and country program activities to be financed through 

sovereign loans from the Bank and partners. The UA 29 million from the ADF XIV Regional Public 

Goods (RPGs) window will solely finance regional public goods described in the TAAT Program 

Framework Document. BMGF has already approved $1.14 million and AGRA is processing a $10 

million grant for centrally managed activities of TAAT. The country programs will be financed via 

AfDB sovereign loans to RMCs, as well as World Bank loans to RMCs to the tune of USD 700 million. 

The Bank’s financing of the central programs will be for nine priority commodities using 

resources from ADF XIV RPG window. This first set of commodities will be implemented over three 

(3) years (2018 to 2020). Only activities of the first nine commodities have been described in more 

detail in the present report, with the costing information below.  

 



 

13 

2.5.2  The total cost of first phase of TAAT is estimated at UA 40.00 million (USD 56.532 

million) net of taxes and based on 2016 prices comprising UA 15.27 million or 38% in local costs 

and UA 24.73 million or 62% in foreign costs. This cost is inclusive of physical and price 

contingencies estimated at average rates of 3% and 5%, respectively. The physical contingencies are 

estimated from 0% (emolument) to 5% (works) based on common practices. The price contingencies 

were estimated on the basis of actual and projected levels of local inflation rates of about 2% per annum 

and foreign inflation rates. 

2.5.3  The summary of the first phase of nine commodities costs by component and by category 

of expenditure are presented respectively in Tables 3-4.

2.6 Program financing arrangements  

2.6.1  Of the total first phase Project cost of UA 40 million (USD 56.532 million), Bank Financing 

will be UA 29 million or USD 40 million (72.5%)  (See Tables 5 and 6). This will finance 100% of 

Goods; 100% of services for the Commodity Technology Delivery Compact (CTDC); 100% funding 



 

14 

for Enable Youth in TAAT (ENABLE-TAAT) and 100% operating costs. Bill and Melinda Gates 

Foundation (BMGF) will provide UA 0.83 million ((USD 1.138 million) or 2.1 %) to assist the 

establishment of the Clearing house. The funding from BMGF will cover recruitment of key staff and 

other operating expenses. The Clearinghouse will play a major role in the TAAT implementation. The 

Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) will provide UA 7.25 million (or USD 10 million) 

to finance 100% services (across Components 1, 2, and 3). The participating RMCs will contribute 

UA2.90 million (7.3%) in local currency, 100% in-kind, by provision of farm land for extension training 

facilities, demonstration activities, and other critical RPGs-promoting activities. Project beneficiaries 

include a variety of stakeholders: agripreneurs, farmer based organizations and cooperatives, 

commodity processors, private sector operators, registered SMEs, seeds producers, agro-input dealers, 

service providers, millers, aggregator and market operators, and young graduates.   

2.6.2  While table 5 below indicates the financing arrangements by local and foreign currency 

distribution, table 6 indicates financing by year. Grants’ allocations by source and expenditure 

categories is presented in Appendix 8a and by components in Appendix 8b

NB: Government contribution is 7.3% and in-kind (national staff salaries, part of the operating cost, rental value of the office space offered, laboratory 

infrastructure and experimental land and the loss in fiscal receipts due to tax and custom duty exemption of different project procurement). It is less than 

10% required because six (6) of the target 22 low-income RMCs are countries are in fragile situations and conflict-affected (see related Annex in Vol. II 
of the Report, Technical Annex)..

2.7 Key Performance Indicators 

The TAAT first phase commodities performance indicators are outlined in the Results Based Logical 

Framework at three levels: Impact, Outcome and Output. 

 The impact indicators relate to more food secure population and dealing with the 
prevalence of stunting among children under 5 years. 

 The outcome indicators are household income, agricultural productivity, job creation, 
tons of additional food commodity, household dietary diversity, value of additional foods 

produced, and number of beneficiaries. 

 The output indicators include: technology policies harmonized across regions/countries, 
weak systems strengthened, improved crop varieties and livestock breeds widely applied, 

technology adoption constraints removed, promotional activities with a focus on 

technologies for safe and nutritious foods, and communities with better access to inputs 

and output markets. Others are best-bet technologies scaled out, campaigns implemented, 

delivery platforms convened, agripreneurs supported, M&Es of platforms carried out, 

trans-national pests and diseases facilitated, technologies identified and deployed, menus 

of proven food production technologies developed, and wide-scale farm extension 

models implemented.  

 See the RBLF for complete list. 

3 FEASIBILITY OF TAAT 

3.1 Economic and Financial Performance 

3.1.1 It is anticipated that the Bank’s intervention will result in positive economic and financial 

impacts in RMCs from the nine priority technologies, especially given the public goods nature of the 

interventions. Economic and financial analyses were carried out using the economic surplus approach 

for the nine selected commodities. Improvements taken into account were streamlined and harmonized 

release of improved crop varieties and livestock breeds, strengthening of seed systems, use of improved 

varieties of crops across the applicable agro-ecological zones, design and implementation of appropriate 

campaigns for trans-national control of pest and diseases, good agricultural practices (GAPs), capacity 

building and outreach, policy support and advisory services, as well as demonstration and promotional 

activities. The benefits were measured based on increase in food supply as a result of improved access 

to proven technologies and other farm inputs. The annual flows of gross economic benefits from 



 

16 

increased crop and livestock productivity, production and value chains were estimated and aggregated. 

The aggregate benefits and costs (per commodity value chain) were then discounted to derive the 

estimated present value (in 2017 values) of total net benefits from the intervention. The benefits and 

costs were later aggregated across the nine priority commodities to calculate the aggregate financial and 

economic impacts.  

3.1.2 The consolidated Net Present Value (NPV) of the Financial Net Benefits was US$ 431.5 

million with an internal rate of return (FIRR) of 27%. Using World Prices (to correct for domestic 

distortions, taxes, and subsidies), the NPV of net economic benefits was calculated at US$ 280 million 

with an internal rate of return of 23%.  The result is quite robust and includes changes in productivity 

(crop and livestock), levels of adoption of proven agricultural technologies, and discount rates. For 

instance, a scenario of adoption by 10% of farmers, 10% productivity increase, and 10% discount rate 

across the nine priority commodities still gave an aggregate NPV of US$ 296 million with an internal 

rate of return of 18%. This supports the potential economic impact of the TAAT approach.  

3.2 Environmental and Social impacts and Gender 

3.2.1 TAAT has been classified as Category 2 operation, indicating that the program activities are 

expected to have limited adverse environmental and social impacts. An Environmental and Social 

Management Framework (ESMF) for the mitigation of adverse environment and social impacts of the 

program was posted on the Bank’s website on 4 July 2017. It provides the processes and methodologies 

to be implemented by the Clearinghouse/PMU to screen and manage potential environmental and social 

impacts and risks likely to result from the proposed agriculture technologies and demonstration 

activities. Because TAAT will be executed at RMCs, the ESMF draws on applicable national and 

regional regulatory frameworks as well as international good practice guiding environmental and social 

management.  

3.2.2  Women’s large overrepresentation in agricultural tasks in Africa, combined with the existence 

of a gender gap in agricultural productivity and the need to boost Africa’s agricultural output calls for 

increased attention to raising female agricultural productivity. The technologies it invests in must 

respond to the needs and priorities of women as well as men in order to level the playing field and 

increase agricultural productivity. Implementing partners must emphasize the deployment of gender-

responsive technologies. There is a strong case within TAAT for carrying out positive gender 

discrimination, since women form the majority of farmers as well as food processors in Africa. Studies 

have shown that women are as efficient as men, given access to same technologies. A World Bank 

publication (2008) clearly documents gender based differences in African agriculture and in terms of 

technology, land, extension, finance, time, mobility and education and training. 

3.2.3  TAAT will ensure the gender responsiveness of the technologies. Evidence shows that 

introducing new agricultural technologies can exacerbate already existing gender disparities and make 

life tougher for smallholder farmers, especially women and girls. However, with proper attention, 

agricultural technologies have the potential to bridge the gender gap and lead to inclusive, agriculture-

driven prosperity for all Africans. The African Women in Agricultural Research and Development 

(AWARD) will be one of the partners for the TAAT program to not only build the capacity of key Bank 

staff and TAAT implementers to be more gender responsive, it will help mitigate potential negative 

gender impacts while upscaling those technologies that bridge Africa’s gender gap in agriculture. The 

TAAT program recognizes that gender equality in agribusinesses is a priority. The mechanisms to 

ensure social inclusion and gender equality in this project include appropriate outreach strategy and 

gender sensitive training on good agricultural practises, as well as adequate provisions for both genders 

to access affordable and quality agricultural technologies and input and output markets. In addition, this 

project will prioritize the adoption of gender friendly technologies and support policies in the target 

countries.

4 IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1 Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1 Structure and Activities of the RTDI (TAAT Platform) 

The structure of the Regional Technology Delivery Infrastructure (RTDI) consists of the Project 

Steering Committee (PSC), the Clearing House, the Commodity Technology Delivery Compact 

(CTDC), and the Project Management Unit (PMU).  These component are described in more details 

below. 

4.1.2  Project Steering Committee (PSC) 

The Project Steering Committee is the highest decision-making body composed of representatives of 

AfDB, African Ministers of Agriculture of participating RMCs, the various CG Centers, the Private 

sector, NARES and regional farmer organizations. The committee provides oversight functions to 

Regional Technology Delivery Infrastructure (RTDI).  All annual work programs will be cleared by the 

PSC prior to funding.  Membership of the Program Steering Committee (PSC) will be approved by the 

Bank.  

4.1.3 Clearinghouse 

The Clearinghouse is the main decision making body of the RDTI when it comes to selecting which 

technologies to disseminate and scale up. It will be substantially autonomous; its work plan and budget 

will be approved by the Program Steering Committee (PSC). The objective of the Clearinghouse is to 

decide which proven agricultural technologies proposed by each Crop/Livestock compact group can be 

rolled out and taken to scale. The activities of the Clearinghouse are indicated in Appendix 1. 

The activities of the Clearinghouse include:  

i) Evaluating requests from the compacts for technologies to be rolled out and scaled up. 
This will be akin to a peer review mechanism of the proposed technologies; 

ii) Validating the design and plan with stakeholders for a buy-in and commitment; 

iii) Identifying the optimal mix of partners that will accompany the implementation, 
backstopping and monitoring of the proposed plan;  

iv) In collaboration with the RMCs, conduct monitoring and assessment of milestones and 
Performance Indicators;  

v) In collaboration with the Bank, advising Governments and private actors on investment 
opportunities and financing mechanisms for going to scale. 

4.1.3.1. Although the Clearinghouse will be based at the IITA sub-station in Cotonou it will be fully 

independent of the IITA management. It is not a part of the PMU and will operate as an independent 

unit with its own competitively recruited Director, supported by technical and support staff.  The key 

skills assets required in the Clearinghouse include: i) technology transfer specialist; ii) an outreach 

expert; iii) a communication expert;  iv) a gender development specialist, and v) M&E Specialist in 

addition to other general services staff.  

4.1.4 Crop/Livestock Technology Delivery Compacts 

At the heart of TAAT’s technology deployment effort is the Crop/Livestock Technology Delivery 

Compact (CTDC).  CTDC is an agreement between the CGIAR center with mandate for the commodity 



 

18 

value chain, NARES, the RMCs and the entire ecosystem of value chain actors—from input supplier, 

processors, aggregators, equipment manufacturers, extension agencies, etc.  The CTDC drives the 

implementation of TAAT activities for each of the nine priority commodities. RMCs who indicate 

interest in accessing and deploying at scale technologies for the commodity in question, can become a 

part of the compact. Request from the CTDCs for deployment of a list of technologies and resources 

required will be submitted to the RTDI, specifically the Program Steering Committee (PSC), who will 

work in tandem with the clearing house to review and approve the appropriate technologies. Figure 4 

shows the structure of the Commodity Technology Delivery Compacts (CTDC). 

4.1.5  The structure of the Regional Technology Delivery Infrastructure (RTDI) can be observed in 

figure 4 and 5. 

The activities of the RTDI or TAAT platform include: 

i) Identification and selection of best-bet technologies for uptake by RMCs involved in 
crop/livestock compacts; the RMCs will be front and center of the compacts to ensure 

ownership and sustainability with attention to specific value chains); 

ii) Improvement of seed systems. Specific tasks are: evaluation of existing seed systems 
to identify strengths and weaknesses, identification of policy and capacity development 

needs to address the weaknesses and take advantage of the strengths, implementation of 

the identified policy and capacity development needs to strengthen the seed systems; 

iii) Harmonization of regional variety release systems to ensure regional spillover effects 
of technologies. Specific tasks are: identification of constraints to variety release and 

access to improved varieties of crops in Africa and why varieties suitable for specific 

agro-ecologies cannot be applied to the wider ecological reach because of country 

boundaries, identification of policy and capacity-building options to address this issue, 

implementation of the identified policy and capacity building options on the ground, 

monitoring the effects); 

iv) Facilitation of trans-national control of pest and diseases.  Specific tasks are: 
awareness raising that pest and diseases do not respect political boundaries with clear 

examples, design and development of appropriate campaigns for trans-national control 

of pest and diseases, implementation of the agreed on campaigns for trans-national 

control of pest and diseases; 

v) Support RMCs with policy audits and reviews to remove constraints to technology 
adoption and use; 

vi) Engage the Sub-Regional Organizations (SROs) on harmonization of agricultural 
technology release and synchronization of foundation seed protocols, disease control, 

monitoring and Integrated Pest Disease Management (IPDM) methods2, and adaptation 

trials of crop varieties across the region, including nutrient rich varieties; 

vii) Design and execute a comprehensive communication strategy to effectively 
communicate the goals, activities, and benefits of the Agricultural Transformation 

Agenda; 

 

                                                           
2  Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM) is combining different methods of pest and disease control ranging from varietal resistance and 

tolerance, chemical control (pesticides, fungicides, bactericides, etc.), biocontrol (using natural enemies of the pests), cultural practices (crop rotation, 
mixed cropping, planting dates,, etc.), and  



 

19 

viii) Fiduciary responsibility for the centralized activities of TAAT.

4.1.6  Two of such Compacts, CIPRISSA (for Rice) and TASI (for the African Savannahs) have 

already been set up by the Bank to coordinate activities for scaling up technologies to achieve self-

sufficiency in rice production and for transformation of the African Savannah into bread baskets. The 

CTDC will also engage Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) and Development Partners, namely 

the World Bank, JICA, IFAD, BMGF, Rockefeller Foundation, African Agriculture Fund (AAF), 

Agriculture Fast-Track Fund, Fund for African Private Sector Assistance (FAPA), Making Finance 

Work for Africa Partnership (MFW4A), Africa Climate Change Fund, Clim-Dev Fund, and Climate 

Investment Funds (CIF), and many others to secure co-financing for TAAT.   

4.1.6.1 The activities of the CTDC include: 

i) Convene a Crop/Livestock technology delivery platform of all major actors for each 
of nine priority commodities (e.g., rice, wheat, aquaculture, water efficient maize for 

Africa, cassava, sorghum/millet, livestock, orange fleshed sweet potato, and high iron 

beans).  Specific tasks are to consult, discuss, and prepare an agreement (the compact) of 

technologies, activities, and focus of the platform. The compact will discuss and agree 

on the technologies to be delivered, packaging, targets and timeline to cost-effectively 

deliver the technologies in a timely fashion; 

ii) Agree with NARES and Extension agencies on approaches to deploy technologies 
Specific tasks are to meet with key stakeholders (NARES, Extension agencies, NGOs, 

private sector, etc.) in RMCs to discuss best approaches to deploy technologies; prioritize 

the approaches in terms of effectiveness; deploy the preferred approaches with the 

country’s agencies leading; monitor progress, learn lessons and make immediate use of 

the lessons in improving delivery; 

iii) Define the target areas.  Specific tasks are to consult with the RMCs about which 
geographic areas to focus on during the different phases of technology deployment; 

discuss and agree with the RMCs on material and human resources required to cover the 

target area and how to sources these; implement the technology; 

iv) Mobilize all actors across the value chain. Specific tasks are to identify and register all 
the key actors across each target commodity’s value chain; call a meeting of the different 

actors across each target commodity value chain to ascertain constraints and how best to 

solve these; assign roles on technology delivery to different actors across the value chain; 

ensure that different actors across the value chain perform the assigned functions; 

monitor, learn lessons and make immediate use of the lessons in improving technology 

delivery; 

v) Design and implement wide-scale farmer extension models and innovative models to 
organize and aggregate farmers; 

vi) Work with FARA and others to build capacity in the NARES and public sector for 
program design, execution, and monitoring, and in the private sector for value chain 

organization and governance; 

vii) Support the development of a young class of ‘agripreneurs’, through demonstration, 
training and financing in coordination with ENABLE youth; 

viii) Promote climate-smart practices among farmers through funding and demonstration 
of the value of sustainable agriculture approaches;  

ix) Set targets and KPIs; monitor the achievement of the KPIs; distil lessons for 
improvements in future; .  Specific tasks are to discuss and identify key target areas; 



 

21 

formulate the targets that are achievable; mobilize those needed to achieve the targets; 

identify appropriate key performance indicators (KPIs) for different targets set 

x) M&E of the platform, using the outcome to improve the performance of the platform. 
Specific tasks are to design appropriate M&E data collection and analysis for the 

platform; discuss and ensure the leadership of RMCs in the M&E; implement the M&E. 

4.1.7. Project Management Unit (PMU) 

The Project Management Unit will: i) oversee day-to-day implementation of project fiduciary and 

administrative activities; ii) organize the transfer of project resources to the institutions leading the 

commodity value chains; iii) coordinate the compilation and review of reports from value chains and 

enablers for submission to the Bank; and iv) elaborate/implement administrative and financial 

management guidelines/template to be used across. 

4.1.8  The decision to pursue TAAT through a consortium of CGIAR Centers, the National 

Agricultural Research Systems (NARES), and their Umbrella body, FARA, donors, and development 

centers was decided at the High Level Conference on Feed Africa held in Dakar, Senegal, October 21-

23, 2015. At that meeting, the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), being the oldest 

CGIAR center in Africa and the center with the most geographical spread – 20 sub-stations across the 

continent, was selected to coordinate the TAAT platform or the Regional Technology Delivery 

Infrastructure (RTDI).  IITA is therefore the Executing Agency (EA). IITA will set up a small Program 

Management Unit (PMU), headed by a competitively recruited Project Coordinator, to undertake 

fiduciary functions (procurement, disbursement, financial administration, reporting, audits, etc.). 

Specific MoUs and implementation agreements will be signed with each of the lead institutions of the 

target commodities and the other key Implementing Agencies (IAs). 

4.1.9  The day-to-day management of the CTDCs is left to the various Lead Centers. Each Lead 

Center, or expert CGIAR center, shall prepare an annual work plan and budget that will be submitted 

for the review and approval by the Clearinghouse based on clearly defined deliverables. African 

Agriculture Technology Foundation (AATF), IITA, and CIMMYT will lead the Water Efficient Maize 

Production; AfricaRice and IWMI shall lead the activities within the Rice Self-sufficiency; IITA leads 

Cassava Intensification; ICRISAT lead in Sahel Food Security; ILRI will lead on livestock; World Fish 

will lead on fish initiative; ICARDA and CIMMYT are responsible for Wheat Self-sufficiency. 

4.1.10  Policy support: International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) will support the various 

institutions on policy issues that enhance successful program implementation and the attainment of the 

expected widespread and transformational impact. IFPRI will also work with other institutions that 

contribute to agricultural development policy work, including ‘The African Seed Access Index 

(TASAI)’, and African Technology Policy Study Network Program (ATPS). It will undertake its 

activities in consultation with each IA, reporting to clearinghouse. 

4.1.11. Capacity development: Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA) shall undertake 

capacity building at all levels within partner institutions and within the Priority Intervention Areas 

(PIAs) and their value chains. They shall also sign a MoU with Regional Technology Delivery 

Infrastructure (RTDI), with indications of their expected role and terms of delivery as well as expected 

budget for the various activities. FARA will ensure that the thematic content of capacity development 

activities and modules are designed and administered in consultation with appropriate and qualified 

entities, including relevant and participating CGIAR Centers. FARA will also undertake its activities in 

consultation with each program initiative team and report to the Clearinghouse. An Activity Plan for 

each initiative will provide detailed work plans. 

 



 

22 

4.1.12  The National Agricultural Research and Extension Services (NARES) will be the primary 

delivery agent for the deployment of the selected technologies, in close consultation with the 

Government Ministries of Agriculture to ensure country buy-in. This will be supported by private sector 

entities and relevant donor/partner programs in the respective countries. These delivery channels include 

the AGRA supported input dealer network, the World Bank supported West African Agricultural 

Productivity Program (WAAPP) and similar programs in other regions. Support from CGIAR Centers 

Value Chain Leaders will be transactional, value for money and demonstrable benefits, supporting 

national institutions to roll out validated and branded technologies. 

4.1.13  Mechanisms for timely startup include the early appointment of the Head of the Clearinghouse 

and Program Coordination team, and execution of implementing MoUs between IITA (the EA) and the 

implementing partners. This team will oversee the project inception workshop to elucidate all the plans 

for a smooth program take-off.  

4.1.14  In the target RMCs, numerous donors are supporting overall agricultural development. Donor 

coordination occurs in different ways including through Thematic Working Groups, Sector Wide 

Approaches (SWAps), and Integrated Sector Approaches. For TAAT, the key donors that have indicated 

commitment so far include AfDB, World Bank, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Rockefeller 

Foundation, and AGRA. These donors have been coordinating efforts through joint design workshops 

aimed at steering the development of TAAT for success and the achievement of the intended impact on 

the ground, and at ensuring that ongoing experiences are taken into account, and not duplicated (e.g., 

World Bank’s WAAPP, EAAPP, and APSA; AGRA’s work on input dealership; and BMGF’s work on 

technology development; etc.). Several of such meetings were attended by representatives of other 

prospective donors such as USAID. This coordination is also critical for effective monitoring of the 

program, and will continue during program implementation.   

4.1.15 Specific roles of each CGIAR center can be found in Table 8. 

4.2 Regional Public Goods (RPG) and Access to RPG Window of ADF 14:  

4.2.1  TAAT meets all features (Stages I and II) of RPGs, namely: (i) non-rival benefits (i.e., one 

country’s consumption does not subtract from the amount available to other countries), (ii) non-

excludable (no country in the region can be excluded from benefiting, except at a prohibitive cost), (iii) 

broad public interest and benefit (as demonstrated by letters of expression of interest from 22 low-

income ADF RMCs and three ADB RMCs and involvement of numerous NARES, FARA, SROs, and 

RECs in the formulation of TAAT); (iv) regional dimension or multi-country involvement (22 low-

income RMCs are targeted; Three ADB countries have expressed interest; TAAT adopts a regional, 

agro-ecological and commodity belt focus; TAAT will renew the drive to transform Agriculture in 

Africa by scaling up regional cooperation in combatting crop and livestock diseases, and accelerating 

delivery and development impact); (v) strong alignment with the Bank’s strategic orientation and 

continental and regional objectives (TAAT is aligned with the Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy and four of 

the five high priority goals - the “High 5s”- namely; Feed Africa, Industrialize Africa, Integrate Africa, 

and Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa; TAAT is one of the flagship initiatives identified 

in the Bank’s recently approved Feed Africa: Strategy for agriculture transformation in Africa: 2016–

2025); (vi) catalytic and upstream role (TAAT’s interventions will remove bottlenecks and 

disincentives that have forestalled uptake of agricultural technologies in Africa and upstream segments 

of commodity value chains, making it catalytic and upstream; Given that the commodities of focus in 

TAAT are strategic to the Bank’s RMCs, as underscored by CAADP, TAAT will clearly play a catalytic 

role to engender strong support for these commodities, and (vii) higher developmental impact in 

cooperating (given that crop and livestock diseases travel freely across national boundaries, making it 

impossible for individual countries to achieve anything better than in cooperation). The different 

products from the CGIAR’s research work (earlier indicated) are indeed RPGs made widely available 

to individuals and organizations working for sustainable agricultural development in the world. It is for 

these reasons of public interest, non-rivalry in partaking in the benefits from TAAT, multi-country 



 

23 

involvement, and non-excludability that TAAT was selected among programs seeking support under 

the RPGs window as part of the 2017 RO prioritization exercise of the ADF-14 (see 2017 Regional 

Operations Prioritization and Selection Report, Ref. MJ/ADC/07/17/02 dated 28 July, 2017). Details 

are presented in Appendix 4.

4.3 Cost-sharing exemption 

4.3.1  The centrally managed activities planned to be funded with RPG resources in Phase I of TAAT 

do not have revenue generating capacity.  They are designed to target 22 low-income RMCs and set the 

stage for upcoming phases, which will require cost-sharing by participating countries, and country 

programs (funded through loans), both of which will benefit and deepen the application of science and 

technology to sustainable agricultural development in Africa. In addition, given TAAT’s regional, agro-

ecological and commodity belt focus, six of the targeted 22 low-income RMCs (Chad, Congo DRC, 

Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Sierra Leone, and Sudan) are loan ineligible and in fragile states. TAAT therefore 

meets the eligibility for cost-sharing exemption and qualifies for financing through grant resources 

outside the PBA allocation (i.e. exclusively from the RO envelope). In line with this policy, OpsCom 

has cleared the cost-sharing exemption for the initial phase of the program, and recommends that cost-

sharing should be explored in subsequent phases after the project is launched. Management considers 

that TAAT meets the eligibility for cost-sharing exemption and therefore seeks Board approval for 

financing of TAAT through grant resources outside the PBA allocation. Details on TAAT’s eligibility 

for the grant funding and cost-sharing exemption are presented in Appendix 9.  

4.4 Linking centrally managed programs to country programs 

4.4.1 TAAT has two planks: the centrally managed operations and the subsequent country programs. 

The benefits that the former will deliver are catalytic and upstream to the main country investment 

programs which will further be financed by the Bank and its partners (the WB, IFAD, AGRA, BMGF, 

etc.). Without TAAT and the support of the Bank, investments by the World Bank and development 

partners may not achieve as great a development impact. A good example is in the control of regional 

pest and disease threats to increased productivity. 

4.5 Private Sector Participation 

4.5.1 TAAT is developing a unique approach to working with the private sector via the Commodity 

Technology Delivery Compacts.  Over 40 private sector organizations ready to partner with TAAT were 

identified during the course of project development. These businesses operate in the areas of input 

manufacture and distribution, commercial seed and propagule production, bio-fertilizers, irrigation 

equipment and supplies, greenhouse construction and food processing. TAAT will create business 

opportunities for the private sector by building seed systems in the rural areas, including agro-dealer 

networks, thereby expanding demand for seeds and services (crop insurance). The Commodity 

Technology Delivery Compact will ensure that the private sector is at the table as opportunities are 

being discussed. 

4.6 Procurement Arrangements 

4.6.1 Procurement of goods, works and the acquisition of consulting services financed by the Bank 

for the program, will be carried out in accordance with the “Procurement Policy and Methodology for 

Bank Group Funded Operations” (BPM), dated October 2015 and following the provisions stated in the 

Financing Agreement. Donor partners (WB, AGRA, BMGF, etc.) may use their own procurement rules 

over the resources which they contribute and implement in a parallel arrangement. The Bank 

procurement rules will apply to Bank financed activities. Specifically, procurement and financial 

management would be carried out as described in Appendix 10 and Appendix 11.   

4.7 Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements 

4.7.1 As part of the M&E System to be carried out by the Commodity Technology Delivery Compact 

(CTDC), advanced monitoring tools aligned with the Bank's Agricultural Transformation Agenda 

indicators will be used to ensure day-to-day effective performance measurement. This includes but is 

not limited to options available at IITA and across its CGIAR Centers including participatory field-level 



 

25 

assessments, remote sensing, GIS, Big Data operations that compile and analyze program and national 

statistics, and advanced statistical diagnoses. Monitoring functions will be accompanied by detailed 

training in the use of these tools; as such, reporting will stem from participatory monitoring methods 

and structured data collection instruments. The functions of Knowledge Management are central to the 

M&E Framework and will be designed as a continuous, dynamic, action-reflection-action process. An 

independent external review will be carried out for TAAT at the end of year 2 (2019). 

4.7.2  An inception report will be prepared by the implementing partners, including baseline status, 

detailed work plans and budgets, as well as communication and technology deployment plans. All 

implementing partners will provide quarterly updates and regular situation reports; a mid-term progress 

report by each IA; a midterm progress report by the Clearinghouse; annual audit reports by independent 

external auditors; regular supervision reports would be carried out jointly by AFDB Country Offices 

and the Clearinghouse for national level interventions. All reports would be shared among the partners 

in the TAAT Framework. 

4.8 Sustainability 

4.8.1 The sustainability of TAAT will be achieved through: i) stronger links between research and 

extension; ii) stronger linkages of farmers to markets; iii) focus on agricultural value chains to ensure 

that the demand and supply sides are integrated; iv) supportive policy and regulatory environments; and 

v) expected higher commitment of governments to agriculture in the focal countries.  

4.9 Potential Risks and Mitigation Measures 

4.9.1 Potential risks and measures to mitigate are shown in Table 9. 

Table 9:  Risks and Mitigation 

Potential Risks Mitigation Measures 

Lack of enabling environment (policy, market, etc.). Provide fact-based & targeted advocacy. 

Weak value chain linkages especially to off-takers and processors Build capacity of outgrowers around established commercial 

companies and processors 

Lack of commitments of stakeholders in implementation  Active engagement of all stakeholders, with clear roles 

Lack of commitment & logistical support to enable training  Sensitization & identification of strategic training partners. 

Policy inconsistency (on part of governments) & long process in 

changing policies. 

Dialogue using fact-based rationale for losses due to policies 

status quo 

Lack of commitment by the youth involved in technology promotion 

and demonstration. 

Proper orientation on mindset change through participatory 

approaches and incubation centers. 

Lack of cooperation by government agencies Dialogue for buy-in. 

Weak NARES capacity and resource base Be focused on important specific interventions. Capacity of 

NARES strengthened. 

Retaining earlier promising technologies that become obsolete along 

the way 

The Clearinghouse will institute a mechanism for identifying 

and decommissioning obsolete technologies

PROJECT SUMMARY 

 

1.1  Project Overview: The Namibia Agricultural Mechanisation and Seed Improvement 
Project’s (NAMSIP) development goal is to improve household food security and reduce 

poverty. The Project’s objectives are to (i) enhance agricultural productivity in order to reduce 

annual importation of staple cereal crops/grains, (ii) facilitate job creation, and (iii) enhance 

household incomes, which will improve the lives of the rural people. The Project will be 

implemented nationwide by the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry (MAWF) over a 

period of 5 years. NAMSIP has 2 components, namely: (a) Component 1 - Value Chain 

Improvement, with 2 sub-components, (i) Agricultural Mechanisation and (ii) Certified Seed 

Systems Improvement; and (b) Component 2 - Institutional Support, with 2 sub-components, 

(i) Capacity Building, and (ii) Project Management. Gender, environmental and social issues 

have been considered in Project activities. The total Project cost is ZAR 1.42 billion which will 

be financed by (i) ADB Loan of ZAR 1.00 billion (70.5%), (ii) Government contribution of 

ZAR 0.36 billion (25.5%), and (iii) beneficiaries contribution of ZAR 0.06 billion (4.0%).  

 

1.2  The Project will directly benefit 294,500 crop producers/farmers (157,558 female and 
136,942 male), and also 10,000 livestock farmers (including 2,500 women livestock farmers). 

In addition, 33 extension and veterinary staff will be trained in agricultural mechanisation 

inorder to ably transfer knowledge and skills to the beneficiaries. The Project will fully support 

111 farmer cooperatives. The Project will generate 111,240 jobs for men, women and youth in 

agricultural production and processing. The Project will also indirectly benefit about 800,000 

people along the cereal and livestock value chains. The FIRR is estimated at 26.00% and NPV 

of ZAR 1.13 billion, at 12% opportunity cost of capital. The EIRR is 23.74% and NPV of ZAR 

1.03 billion, at 12 % opportunity cost of capital. To promote inclusive growth, NAMSIP will 

facilitate equitable allocation of resources to participating rural men, women and youths, and 

also implement its activities in a sustainable manner. 

 

1.3  Needs Assessment: Agriculture is the biggest employer in Namibia but contributed 
3.4% share to GDP (2016) and has low wage rates. Consequently, transforming agriculture 

constitutes the biggest pathway for creating quality jobs and reducing inequality in Namibia. 

The Fifth National Development Plan (NDP5: 2017/2018-2021/2022), Harambee Prosperity 

Plan (HPP: 2016/2017-2019/2020) and Growth at Home Strategy for Industrialization identify 

agriculture as a priority area which has the potential to contribute to economic progression, 

social transformation and environmental sustainability. The HPP has set up an ambitious target 

with regard to hunger poverty under Pillar 3 (Social Progression) that “no Namibian should 

die of hunger during and after Harambee period”. The Government’s policy is to increase 

agricultural production by expanding the development of irrigation schemes and also 

promoting dryland crop production through agricultural mechanisation and seed systems 

improvement in order to boost cereal crops and livestock production which can be used as 

launch pads for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) driven industrialization. NAMSIP has 

been designed based on the Government’s Harambee Comprehensively Coordinated and 

Integrated Agricultural Development Programme (HACCIADEP: 2017). HACCIADEP was 

developed to stimulate high quality production and market access for crops and livestock 

products especially from small and medium scale agricultural producers and agro-processors. 

NAMSIP’s focus on agricultural mechanization, livestock and seed improvement directly 

responds to NDP5 and HPP which aim at structural transformation through increase in 

agricultural productivity and value addition as game changers. One of the key challenges 

affecting food security in Namibia is the inability of rural producers to timely access farm 

machinery and equipment necessary for effective land preparation, planting, weeding and 

harvesting which negatively affect agricultural production, post-harvest handling and 

marketing. Agricultural mechanisation will enable farmers to complete farming operations in 

a timely manner, especially in dry land farming system, and also help in increasing productivity 



 

v 

 

and reducing cost of cultivation. Introduction of farm mechanisation is being accentuated by 

shortage of agricultural labour in rural areas due to increased migration of youth to urban areas, 

since most farming activities are carried out on small land holdings which utilise manual labour 

and draught animal power. The modernization of agriculture, through mechanization, will 

contribute to overall increase in cereal crops production. This will result in 40% reduction of 

the country’s imports of grain/cereal crops needs which is estimated at 60% per annum 

(MAWF/FAO 2016 data). 

 

1.4  Bank’s Added Value: The proposed NAMSIP is responding to development challenges 
in agriculture sector and is in line with the Government’s development agenda. In view of the 

prevailing liquidity constraints in the domestic market, the long term tenure of the Bank’s 

lending in South African Rand (ZAR) will have softer impact on public debt than borrowing 

from international capital market. Through NAMSIP, the Bank will leverage its unique position 

as a reliable and trusted partner of choice to sustain and help implement development projects 

in Namibia. The NAMSIP design has been guided by the Bank’s past and on-going agriculture 

projects which focussed on improving crop and livestock value chains. Lessons learnt from the 

Bank’s involvement in agriculture sector include the need to involve beneficiaries, in a 

participatory manner, during project design and implementation in order to enhance ownership 

and ensure sustainability. The Bank’s Country Strategy Paper (CSP: 2014-2018) is anchored 

on two pillars: (i) Infrastructure – transport, energy and water; and (ii) Private Sector 

Development – skills development and improving the regulatory environment. NAMSIP is 

aligned to the second pillar of the CSP through enhancement of crop and livestock development 

with involvement of the private sector, especially in supply and major maintenance of 

agricultural machinery and equipment. The Project is aligned to the Bank’s Ten Year Strategy 

(TYS: 2013-2022) core operational areas of infrastructure and also areas of special emphasis 

namely agriculture and gender in that it will improve availability and access of agricultural 

mechanisation and certified seeds to enhance productivity, develop irrigation and civil 

infrastructure, enhance household income, food security and nutrition, create jobs and promote 

gender mainstreaming. Gender mainstreaming is also in line with Pillar II of the Gender 

Strategy (2014-2018). The Project is also in line with the TYS on inclusive growth by focussing 

on the smallholder farmers. NAMSIP is fully aligned to the Bank’s 2 priority-High-5 areas, 

namely, (i) Feed Africa, and (ii) Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa. Based on 

the Feed Africa Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in Africa (2016-2025), NAMSIP 

design has adopted a value chain approach to address various challenges in a manner that 

increases crop and livestock productivity in order to create an enabling agribusiness 

environment. 

 

1.5  Knowledge Management: NAMSIP will contribute to the generation of knowledge 
throughout the implementation period which will be useful during design and implementation 

of future similar projects especially on how to (i) improve crop and livestock development, (ii) 

use smallholder farmers cooperatives to produce good quality certified seeds to improve 

productivity, (iii) raise household incomes of smallholder farmers, and (iv) broaden 

employment and job opportunities along cereal crops and livestock value chains. The focus on 

livestock disease control and management will also generate knowledge for future 

interventions to enhance livestock production which is in line with the development of 

knowledge-based economy. The generated knowledge will be documented through routine 

monitoring and shared with key stakeholders during Project implementation. The Project-

related online information shall be available, to the public, through the existing 

Government/MAWF website which will be updated regularly by the Project.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE MANAGEMENT TO THE BOARD OF 

DIRECTORS ON PROPOSED LOAN FOR THE NAMIBIA AGRICULTURAL 

MECHANISATION AND SEED IMPROVEMENT PROJECT 

 

Management submits the following Report and Recommendation of an ADB Loan proposal of ZAR 

1.00 billion from the Bank resources to finance the Namibia Agricultural Mechanisation and Seed 

Improvement Project (NAMSIP). 

 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE 
 

1.1.  Project Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

 

1.1.1. Namibia is a semi-arid country in south-western Africa with a total land area of 824,268 km2 
consisting of poorly vegetated semi desert-like areas, Namib Desert, Kalahari Desert, extensive 

savannah and woodlands, and subtropical forests. Namibia is one of the sunniest (300 days per year) 

and driest countries in the world. The climate is characterized by hot and dry conditions with mean 

temperature of 24°C in summer and 14°C in winter. About 92% of the land area is defined as hyper-

arid, arid or semi-arid. Rainfall patterns are characterized by their high temporal and spatial variability. 

Mean annual rainfall is about 285 mm, out of which 83% evaporates, 14% is used up by vegetation, 1% 

recharges groundwater and 2% becomes runoff. Low and variable rainfall and inherently poor soils are 

major obstacles to agriculture production. Five perennial rivers are found along the borders with 

neighbouring countries whilst other inland rivers are ephemeral. Despite this, Namibia is blessed with 

rich natural resources and also well-developed physical infrastructure. Namibia has enjoyed relative 

peace and political stability since independence in 1990 and has good track record of economic 

performance due to a stable political environment and prudent macroeconomic policies. With a median 

growth rate of 4.5% since independence, real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was USD 

11,408.10 in 20154. However, Namibia has one of the most unequal income distributions in Africa, with 

a 2016 Gini coefficient of 0.57. According to Namibia Statistics Agency’s (NSA) Labour Force Survey 

(2016), the overall unemployment rate is 34% due to prolonged drought that has affected the agricultural 

sector. The Labour Force Survey (2016) results demonstrate the importance of the agricultural sector in 

Namibia economy and in the livelihoods of people. Unemployment (34%), poverty (18% of the 

population is below poverty line, that is, less than USD 39 per month) and household food insecurity 

are major challenges. According to the Fifth National Development Plan (NDP5: 2017/2018-

2021/2022), poverty is a major factor limiting access to food due to reliance on market purchases for 

food. 

 

1.1.2. In 2016, mining accounted for about 11.3% of GDP (Annual National Accounts/ANA 2016), 
but employed only 2% of the labour force. On the other hand, agriculture which is the biggest employer, 

contributed only 3.4% share to GDP (ANA 2016). Although adverse weather is partly responsible for 

agriculture’s relatively small contribution to Namibia’s GDP, lack of modernisation in farming 

techniques and lack of infrastructure in business development have made the agriculture sector less 

efficient and profitable than it might otherwise be. Agriculture sector remains a strategic sector for many 

Namibians. The low employment elasticity of key growth drivers and the low wage in the agriculture 

sector partly explains the failure by the economy to translate high growth rates into more jobs and greater 

income equality. Consequently, transforming agriculture constitutes the biggest pathway for creating 

jobs and reducing inequality. The Project is in line with the NDP5, Harambee Prosperity Plan (HPP: 

2016/2017-2019/2020) and Growth at Home Strategy for Industrialization which identify agriculture as 

a priority area that has potential to contribute to economic progression, social transformation, 

environmental sustainability and good governance. NDP5 is an instrument for Namibia’s Vision 2030 

on prosperity, harmony, peace and political stability. The HPP has set up a target with regard to hunger 

                                                 
4 World Bank Country Income Classification (December, 2016) categorizes Namibia is as an Upper Middle Income Country.

poverty, under Pillar 3 (Social Progression), that “no Namibian should die of hunger during and after 

Harambee period”. The Namibia’s comparative socio-economic indicators are reflected in Appendix 1. 

 

1.1.3. The agriculture sector remains central to the lives of majority of Namibians since it, directly or 
indirectly, supports over 70% of the country's population. The sector can be divided into two distinct 

sub-sectors (i) capital intensive, relatively well developed and export oriented commercial sub-sector 

which covers about 44% of the total arable land, though it accommodates only 10% of the population, 

and (ii) subsistence-based, high-labour, low-technology communal sub-sector which covers 41% of the 

total arable area and accommodates about 60% of the population. Agricultural production, and 

subsequently household income, is low in the subsistence sector due to chronic drought/water shortages 

resulting in death of animals and also crop failures. Other problems include frequent occurrence of 

animal diseases, widespread soil erosion and land degradation, inadequate agricultural land, high cost 

of agricultural inputs, lack of access to finances, poor farmer organisation, low farm-labour force, 

inability of rural farmers to timely access quality certified seeds, and also farm machinery/equipment. 

In Namibia, the major food crops are pearl millet (mahangu), maize, sorghum, and wheat. According to 

MAWF, in 2016, the Government imported about 60% of Namibia’s cereal needs.  

 

1.1.4. The Namibia Agricultural Mechanisation and Seed Improvement Project (NAMSIP) has been 
designed in line with MAWF’s Harambee Comprehensively Coordinated and Integrated Agricultural 

Development Programme (HACCIADEP: 2017). The HACCIADEP aims at stimulating high quality 

production and market access for crops and livestock products especially from small and medium scale 

farmers and agro-processors. The HACCIADEP has 10 schemes (total estimated cost of ZAR 13 billion) 

namely: (i) Flood water irrigation and infrastructure development scheme, (ii) Northern Communal 

Areas (NCA) Beef value chain development scheme, (iii) Small stock value chain development scheme 

for small and medium scale agricultural producers and agro-processors in the Southern Region of 

Namibia, (iv) Agricultural mechanization scheme, (v) Cereal value chain development scheme, (vi) 

Horticulture value chain development scheme, (vii) Poultry value chain development scheme, (viii) 

Milk value chain development, (ix) Seed System development, and (x) Debushing and bush value chain 

development scheme. At the request of the Government, NAMSIP will contribute to the attainment of 

HACCIADEP’s 2 schemes, namely (i) agricultural mechanization scheme, and (ii) seed systems 

development scheme, which are key for sustainable crop and livestock value chain improvement. One 

of the key challenges affecting food security in Namibia is the inability of rural producers to timely 

access farm machinery and equipment necessary for effective land preparation, planting, weeding and 

harvesting which negatively affect agricultural production, post-harvest preservation and marketing. 

Mechanisation will enable farmers to complete farming operations in a timely manner and also help in 

increasing productivity and reducing cost of cultivation, especially in rainfed farming systems, where 

the rainy season is short. Above that, introduction of farm mechanisation is being accentuated by 

shortage of agricultural labour in rural areas due to increased migration of youth to urban areas, since 

most farming activities are carried out on small land holdings which utilize mainly manual labour and 

draught animal power. The support to the certified seeds system development will help to address the 

challenges on availability of high quality seeds, especially under the dry land crop production 

programme, which will lead to increased nutrient dense crop productivity. Certified seed quality is the 

most important determinant of agricultural production potential on which the efficacy of other 

agricultural inputs depends. Seed of appropriate high value characteristics are required to meet the 

demand of diverse agro-climatic conditions and cropping system. 

 

1.1.5. NAMSIP will enhance dryland crop production, irrigated crop production, State Owned 
Enterprises (SOEs), and Private Sector operations through effective utilisation of agricultural machinery 

and equipment for livestock production, and processing which can be used as launch pads for SME-

driven industrialization. The Project will contribute to the Namibia’s Growth at Home Strategy which 

focuses on supporting value addition for sustainable growth and securing local and international market 

access. NAMSIP will significantly contribute to Government’s plans to (i) achieve “zero deaths” (HPP 

outcome # 7) as a result of hunger, (ii) improve food security and nutrition, and (iii) promote import 



 

3 

 

substitution of staple foods by focusing on cereal-crops and livestock value chains. NAMSIP will also 

contribute to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (i) SDG #1 (No Poverty) - 

growth in agriculture is effective at reducing poverty, (ii) SDG #2 (Zero Hunger) - efficient crop 

production improves food security and nutrition, and (iii) SDG #5 (Gender Equality) - provision of 

resources to women farmers enhance agricultural productivity.  

 

1.2.  Rationale for Bank’s Involvement 

 

1.2.1. In January/February 2017, the Government of Namibia and the Bank agreed on 2 interventions 
to meet both short term and long term financing needs comprising (i) a Programme Based Operation 

(PBO)/budget support (ZAR 6 billion, approved in May 2017) to support the Government’s bold reform 

programme and finance the fiscal deficit, and (ii) an investment programme (ZAR 4 billion) to fill the 

financing gaps created by fiscal consolidation measures in ‘ready to go’ HPP projects. The NAMSIP 

(ZAR 1 billion) is part of the ZAR 4 billion investment programme and complements the approved ZAR 

6 billion PBO by addressing agricultural mechanisation, certified seeds and infrastructure bottlenecks 

in the agriculture sector, as indicated in Appendix 2. The other 2 investment projects are under Transport 

Sector (ZAR 2 billion) and Education Sector (ZAR 1 billion), which are being processed concurrently.  

 

1.2.2. NAMSIP is aligned to one of the Bank’s Ten Year Strategy (TYS: 2013-2022) core operational 
areas of infrastructure and also areas of special emphasis namely agriculture and gender in that it will 

improve availability and access of agricultural mechanisation and certified seeds, enhance household 

income, food security and nutrition, and gender mainstreaming. Gender mainstreaming is also in line 

with Pillar II of the Gender Strategy (2014-2018). The Project will ensure inclusiveness of rural farmers 

(men, women and youths) as direct beneficiaries. NAMSIP is fully aligned to the Bank’s 2 priority High-

5 areas, namely, (i) Feed Africa, and (ii) Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa. Based on 

the Feed Africa Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in Africa (2016-2025), NAMSIP design has 

adopted a value chain approach to simultaneously address challenges in a manner that increases 

agricultural productivity and facilitates an enabling agribusiness environment. NAMSIP is aligned to 

Feed Africa Strategy’s Enabler #1–“Increase Productivity” through provision of agricultural 

mechanisation and improved certified seeds (pearl millet, maize, sorghum, and cowpeas) since these are 

the weakest links of the cereal crops value chain. The Bank’s Country Strategy Paper (CSP: 2014-2018) 

is anchored on two pillars: (i) Infrastructure – transport, energy and water; and (ii) Private Sector 

Development – skills development and improving the regulatory environment. NAMSIP is aligned to 

CSP’s second pillar through involvement of the private sector in supply and major maintenance of 

agricultural machinery and equipment.  

 

1.2.3. The Bank’s active portfolio in Namibia, as at July 2017, comprised 7 on-going projects with a 
total commitment of UA 577.3 million. The financial sector dominates the portfolio with 43.1%, 

followed by transport sector with 28.3%, social sector with 0.1%, and multi-sector with 28.5%. The 

Projects are mainly funded through the ADB public-sector window (99.83%) and MIC TAF Grant 

(0.17%). Multi-sector operations include a budget support operation, and MIC Grant technical 

assistance projects supporting Walvis Bay Corridor Group capacity building and studies, PPP 

institutional strengthening, statistical capacity building, and higher education quality assurance. 

Appendix 3 presents the Bank’s on-going portfolio in Namibia. According to the Bank’s July 2017 

Portfolio Flashlight, 71.4% of Namibia’s active projects performed satisfactorily. There is no 

problematic or ageing operation. There is no agriculture sector project in Namibia. There is no PCR 

backlog of completed agriculture operations. 

 

1.3.  Donor Coordination   
 

1.3.1. Development Partners’ (DPs) coordination in Namibia is not very strong. Efforts to improve 
coordination have just started under the leadership of the United Nations Resident Coordinator’s office 

in collaboration with the National Planning Commission (NPC) to enhance cooperation, coordination 



 

4 

 

of policies, strategies and approaches which support development and effective communication with the 

Government. The dialogue platform under NPC is for all the sectors and thus there is no platform 

specific to agriculture sector. Through the dialogue platform coordinated by NPC, DPs carry out 

activities and finance projects whose outcomes are usually considered during policy formulation. The 

DPs contribution to the agriculture budget is about 4.2% (2016/2017 financial year), as summarised in 

Table 1.1. Although the Bank (AfDB) has been active in other Sectors (Finance, Transport and Social), 

it is one of the donors, coming on board, to support a major project in the agriculture sector. The Bank 

partnerships will be harnessed with all DPs particularly those operating within the CSP (2014-2018) 

focus areas.

2.2. Technical Solutions Retained and Other Alternatives Explored 
 

The technical solution which was retained comprises use of modern farming machinery, 

equipment and vehicles in order to reduce the time required for land preparation. The drip and sprinkler 

irrigation systems have been chosen, due to their high irrigation efficiency, taking into account the 



 

6 

 

scarcity of surface and groundwater resources in Namibia. NAMSIP has included the equipment to 

address the problem of livestock diseases in order to enhance the marketing of livestock and livestock 

products. Table 2.2 indicates other alternatives which were explored.   

 

Table 2.2: Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection 

 
Altenative Name  Brief Description Reasons for Rejection 

Animal draught 

power and manual 

system. 

Use of work oxen for 

garden preparation.   

Use of animal draught power is relatively less efficient. Livestock 

diseases may affect farming activities if not timely controlled  

Use of traditional hand 

hoe.  

Use of hand hoe is less efficient in terms of timeliness and increases 

drudgery on farmers (low factor productivity – land and labour). 

Surface irrigation 

system 

Irrigating crops from 

open canals using 

furrow or beds.  

This technology is not suitable since water is very scarce resource and 

there is very high evaporation. Surface network attracts high 

maintenance costs and may accelerate soil erosion.  

 

2.3.  Project Type 

 

The NAMSIP is a stand-alone investment Project aimed at improving cereal-crops/grains and 

livestock value chains.  

 

2.4.  Project Cost and Financing Arrangements 
 

2.4.1 The proposed ADB loan is denominated in South African Rand (ZAR) since Namibia Dollar 
(NAD/N$) is pegged to ZAR (1:1) thus (i) avoiding further exchange rate risk exposure, and (ii) 

increasing foreign exchange reserves. The Project cost, including physical and price contingencies, is 

ZAR 1.42 billion (net of taxes and duties) which will be financed by (i) ADB Loan of ZAR 1.00 billion 

(70.5%) covering all major Project activities, (ii) the Government contribution of ZAR 0.36 billion 

(25.5%) through in-kind (monetary value) for existing Government staff salaries linked to Project 

activities, office space including utilities, and vehicles, and (iii) beneficiaries in-kind contribution of 

ZAR 0.06 billion (4.0%) through specific labour during agricultural production activities and also 

valuable time for attending training sessions. The price contingencies were based on projected local and 

foreign inflation rates of 5% and 2% per annum, respectively. The physical contingencies ranged from 

0% (Government staff salaries) to 8% (works) based on (i) common technical practices, and (ii) 

available Engineer’s cost estimates. Summary of the Project costs by components, sources of financing, 

expenditure categories and schedule by component are presented in Tables 2.3 to 2.6 and the details are 

in Project Appraisal Report (PAR) Volume II Technical Annex B.2.  

 

2.4.2 Justification for Government Level of Contribution: The Government/beneficiary’s total 
contribution of ZAR 0.42 billion represents about 29.5% of the total NAMSIP cost which is less than 

the recommended 50% minimum counterpart contribution as per the Bank’s 2008 “Policy on 

Expenditure Eligible for Bank Group Financing”. The policy further stipulates that the ADB may 

finance more than 50% of the total project costs on a case-by-case basis and up to a limit that does not 

exceed 100%. The justifications for the reduced Government contribution is based on (i) Government’s 

budget situation and debt level, (ii) country’s Financing Allocation to the Agriculture Sector, and (iii) 

Government’s commitment to implement other development programmes including proposed Transport 

Sector project (ZAR 5.52 billion) in which the Government has contributed over 64%. Details are in 

Appendix 5. In view this, there is a case for the Bank to reduce the Government’s counterpart funding 

of NAMSIP to 25.5%.

2.5.  Project Target Area, Population and Beneficiaries 

 

 The Project will be implemented nationwide (14 Regions of Namibia) as indicated in Appendices 

4 and 6. Appendix 4 has also included population data for each Region. Namibia has 517,649 households 

with estimated population of 2.28 million (2016/2017 NHIES). The agriculture mechanization scheme, 

if fully implemented, will target 58,900 crop producers (including 50% female) with about 117,857 ha 

of land to be serviced per annum and thus within a period of 5 years the scheme will benefit 

approximately 294,500 producers (including 50%) on 589,285 ha under production. The Project will 

directly target and empower 10,000 livestock farmers (including 2,500 women livestock farmers). In 

addition, 33 agricultural extension staff will be capacitated on agriculture mechanization for transfer of 

skills to the beneficiaries. The Project will fully support 111 farmer cooperatives with a total 

membership of 10,681 of whom 6,912 will be women. The Project will generate 111,240 jobs for men, 

women and youth in agricultural production and processing, as indicated in Appendix 7. The Project 

will also indirectly benefit from 300,000 people under dryland/rainfed agriculture and irrigation through 

generation of employment along cereal crops and livestock value chains, including suppliers, local 

traders, casual labourers, agro-processors, millers, transporters, rural youth, men and women. About 

500,000 people will indirectly benefit and be food secure due to improved cereal crop production. 

2.6. Participatory Process for Project Identification, Design and Implementation 

 

The proposed Project intervention areas have been extracted from the HACCIADEP which was 

developed by the MAWF after countrywide consultations with key stakeholders inorder to give 

practical, tangible and visible meaning to policy intentions of the Government, as defined in Vision 

2030, HPP and NDP5. These 3 policy documents had also gone through intensive countrywide 

consultations with key stakeholders during their formulation. The Bank, during NAMSIP preparation in 

January/February 2017, held consultations with senior Government staff in the Ministry of Finance, 

NPC, MAWF, Ministry of Gender and Social Welfare, Ministry of Poverty Eradication and Social 

Welfare, Ministry of Industrialization, Trade and SMEs Development, Ministry of Environment and 

Tourism (MET), and representatives from SOEs (Namibia Agronomic Board/NAB, Agricultural 

Business Development Agency/AgriBusDev, Agricultural Bank of Namibia/AgriBank, Agricultural 

Marketing and Trading Agency/AMTA), Namibia National Farmers Union (NNFU), DPs, and Private 

Sector. Consultation and feedback on the interventions were undertaken which informed the NAMSIP. 

During the Project Appraisal Mission (July 2017) further consultations were made with the same 

institutions. Project implementation will be carried out through the existing Government/MAWF 

structures. In line with the Project’s capacity building sub-component, smallholder farmers (rural men, 

women and youth) will be fully involved during implementation of planned activities including 

participatory Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E).  

 

2.7. Bank Group Experience and Lessons Reflected in Project Design 

 

 The Bank has enormous experience in designing and implementation of agriculture projects in 

Africa. Some lessons learnt from implementing past projects and through experience of other donors in 



 

9 

 

Namibia have been used to inform the design and subsequent implementation of NAMSIP, as tabulated 

below: 

 
No Lessons Learnt  Actions incorporated in the Project design 

1.  Lack of construction drawings at project start-up 
resulted in delay in implementation. 

Drawings and tender documents for standard drip and sprinkler 

irrigation systems are available with the Government.  

2.  Role played by Project Implementation Unit (PIU) 
in expediting project execution. 

MAWF’s Project implementation capacity will be enhanced through 

recruitment of 3 TAs who will be part of the PIU. 

3.  Inadequate consultation with stakeholders results 
in poor management of the proposed investments 

Adequate consultations with key stakeholders were undertaken during 

Project preparation and appraisal phases. 

4.  Weak M&E system results in poor assessment of 
implementation progress 

M&E activities with adequate financial allocation have been 

included in Project design. 

 

2.8. Project Performance Indicators 
 

The logical framework (LogFrame) has provided the impact, outcome and output indicators 

which will be measured during Project implementation using M&E system. The impact indicator is 

“percentage (%) reduction of food insecure people”. The outcome indicators are (i) nutrient dense crop 

production (tonnes), (ii) percentage (%) reduction of annual cereal imports, and (iii) number of jobs 

created. Major output indicators are reflected in the LogFrame. 

 

III. PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

 
 

3.1.  Economic and Financial Performance 

 

3.1.1. Financial Analysis: The financial analysis has been carried out at the farm household level as 
well as the entire Project level. This has been done by comparing the benefits accruing to the individual 

beneficiaries, and aggregated for the Project as a whole on “with Project” and “without Project” basis. 

Gross margin analyses have been carried out for the major crops to be grown under the Project, namely 

maize, pearl millet (mahangu), sorghum and wheat with first 3 crops to be grown under dryland/rainfed 

while wheat will be grown under irrigation. Pearl millet will take up the largest share of land which 

constitutes about 57% of the total land under cultivation. These analyses assumed full utilization of the 

area targeted for production starting from third year of Project implementation period. The land 

distribution per crop per season, summary of analysis of individual crop budgets, and net income (gross 

margin) at household level have been presented in PAR-Volume II Technical Annex B.7. Results: The 

analysis shows that annual net income (gross margin) per farming household in the Project increased 

(under crop production) from ZAR 19,742 to ZAR 74,179 while income from livestock production 

increased from ZAR 5,221 to ZAR 16,012. The gross margin analyses took into consideration the farm 

gate prices of the produce and the total cost of production, including an imputed wage of ZAR 300 per 

hectare for family farm labour per farming season. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) to the 

Project is estimated at 26.00%, and the net present value (NPV), at 12% opportunity cost of capital, is 

estimated at ZAR 1.13 billion.  

 

3.1.2. Economic Analysis: The agriculture sector farm inputs market is subsidized by Government and 
therefore financial prices for the farm inputs have been adjusted by a standard conversion factor of 1.3 

that took into account the level of subsidies for the farm inputs and taxes. The economic prices for farm 

produce have been derived using a standard conversion factor of 0.82   Results: The economic internal 

rate of return (EIRR) to the Project is estimated at 23.74% and the net present value (NPV), at 12 % 

opportunity cost of capital, is estimated at ZAR 1.03 billion. 

 

3.1.3. Sensitivity Analysis: Sensitivity analysis shows that an increase in the cost of production  by 
10% reduces FIRR to 17% and NPV to ZAR 0.51 billion and a fall in the revenue by 10% reduces FIRR 

to 13 % and NPV to ZAR 0.065 billion. An increase in the cost of production by 5% reduced EIRR to 

18.78% and NPV to ZAR 0.64 billion while a fall in revenue by 5% reduced EIRR to 16.88% and NPV 

to ZAR 0.45 billion.

Note: calculations are indicated in Appendix 8 of this PAR and also in PAR Volume II, Technical Annex B.7. 

 

3.2.  Environmental and Social impacts 

 

3.2.1. Environment and Social Issues: The Project was classified as Category 2 in line with the Bank’s 
Environmental and Social Assessment Procedures (ESAP), which requires only the Environmental and 

Social Management Plan (ESMP). The ESMP was prepared by the Government, cleared by the Bank 

and posted on Bank’s website5 on 25th October 2017. The provision of farm machinery and equipment 

to smallholder farmers and agro-processors as well as the development and supply of improved seeds 

are slated to engender significant positive impacts on food production, climate resilience, economic 

development, livelihoods and quality of life of NAMSIP beneficiaries. Nevertheless, the development 

of crop and livestock operations can result in direct and indirect environmental and social impacts, 

including loss of fauna and flora, degradation of terrestrial habitats and disruption or contamination of 

water courses. These negative impacts are expected to be site-specific and can be minimized by applying 

appropriate mitigation measures. During Project implementation, the existing MAWF ESMP Task 

Force will be maintained inorder to ensure adequate environmental and social management, compliance 

with national laws, and to monitor and report on ESMP implementation. NAMSIP has made financial 

provision to address ESMP implementation capacity gaps and environmental and social management 

needs. The total cost associated with ESMP implementation is about ZAR 8 million, excluding costs for 

mitigation measures related to civil works which will be reflected in respective contractors’ bills of 

quantities (BoQs). Additional information on environmental issues is in Appendix 9 and also in PAR 

Volume II Technical Annex B.8. 

 

3.2.2. Climate Change: The Project was classified as Category 2 and is potentially vulnerable to climate 
risk. Practical climate risk mitigation measures have been taken into consideration in the location and 

design of the proposed irrigation infrastructure. Furthermore, arid conditions and erratic rainfall threaten 

the viability of agricultural production. Therefore, the inclusion of the component on certified seed 

(cereal crops) production through irrigation qualifies as an adaptation activity. This Project will be 

implemented taking into consideration opportunities to enhance climate resilience of the agriculture 

value chains and also enhance adaptive capacity of stakeholders to manage the impacts of climate 

change through improved extension services. The implementation of these activities is aligned with 

national ambitions to “instil resilience to impacts of climate change in the most vulnerable sectors of 

the economy” articulated in Nationally Determined Contributions to the UNFCCC. Proposed activities 

include developing and implementing appropriate responses and adaptation strategies to reduce the 

impacts of floods, low rainfall and high temperatures on people, crops, livestock and infrastructure. 

Agricultural adaptation strategies include (i) coordinating the timing of ploughing and crop planting 

with rainfall events, (ii) using drought-resistant crop varieties and livestock breeds, (iii) shifting 

livestock to alternative grazing areas, and (iv) implementing soil and water conservation activities. 

Mechanisation in agriculture is usually associated with use of diesel powered equipment whose emission 

will be mitigated through specifications of engines which include either (i) recirculation of exhaust gas 

to dilute intake of air/oxide, or (ii) cooling the exhaust gases in order to inhibit formation of nitrogen. 

With regards to climate finance, NAMSIP’s climate related activities will contribute ZAR 0.2 billion to 

the Bank’s target. The majority of Namibian population, especially rural households, depend on climate-

sensitive sub-sectors such as crop production and livestock farming. Consequently, climate change 

variability will only serve to compound the impacts on livelihoods, food security, and community well-

being. Changes in rainfall patterns and increased temperatures affect crop yields, increases droughts and 

reduces feedstock resulting in livestock losses. Namibia has thus prioritized environmental protection, 

specifically climate change, as evidenced by the adoption of the National Policy on Climate Change

(2011) and the National Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (2013-2020). The latter aims, under 

the food security and sustainable resource use pillar, to: (i) improve climate change understanding and 

related policy responses in food security; (ii) develop, identify and disseminate climate resilient crop 

farming practices; (iii) enhance sustainable land management and suitable land use practices; and (iv) 

ensure maintenance of resilient ecosystems to ensure climate resilience, and environmental 

sustainability. 

 

3.2.3. Land Issues: Land is fundamental to the lives of smallholder farmers especially women and 
youth since women account for 59% of people engaged in skilled and subsistence agriculture in 

Namibia. The Namibia Constitution and the National Land Policy (1998) lay the foundation for land 

ownership and established basic principles for the governance of all land in Namibia, with a strong 

emphasis on protecting the rights of the poor and women and promoting transparency and accountability 

in land administration. Namibia’s agriculture sector consists of 2 types of land ownership, namely, 

freehold title deeds mainly in the central and southern commercial areas and non-title deeds mainly in 

the Northern Communal Areas (NCA). The Government efforts are in place to bring equity in land 

ownership, through land redistribution and tenure reform which have been shaped by Agricultural 

(Commercial) Land Reform Act 6 of 1995 and the Communal Land Reform Act 5 of 2002. These land 

reforms focus, amongst others, on redistribution of commercial farmland to redress past imbalances in 

land ownership among Namibians. Considering that land tenure is important for the Project, the MAWF 

emphasised the role the communal land reforms plays in strengthening the smallholder farmers’ access 

and ownership to land and credit. The Namibia Constitution in Article 95 (a) accords women the same 

status as men, with regard to all forms of land rights, either as individuals or as members of family land 

ownership trusts. Equal rights to land have been granted to both men and women in communal areas. 

 

3.2.4. Gender: In Namibia, 44% of rural households are headed by females. Most female landowners 
are widows who inherited the land from their husbands, followed by women who obtained land through 

divorce or inheritance from families. Since the commencement of the Communal Land Reform Act 

(CLRA) No. 5 of 2002, single women can register their land without the consent of family members. 

The CLRA protects wives and gives them the right to apply for and register land in their names. In 2016, 

it was estimated that more than 40% of all land use certificates in Namibia were issued to women. The 

land use certificates for communal land guarantee the use of the land in perpetuity. Furthermore, the 

CLRA mandates the inclusion of a minimum of four women in the Communal Land Board (CLB) that 

facilitates land registration. The main source of income for female farmers is subsistence farming. They 

dominate in most cropping activities except in land preparation. On the other hand, animal husbandry 

(cattle, sheep and goats) is almost exclusively a male domain although herding small stock is sometimes 

done by women whilst feeding livestock has a 50/50 gender division of labour. Women and children are 

responsible for fuel wood and wild fruit gathering. Women also dominate post-harvest processing of 

crops such as sun drying, threshing and winnowing, head-loading to markets, and storing for market or 

future use. The Government has embarked on new levels of improving women’s lives in rural areas but 

according to the 2013 Gender Needs Assessment, there are challenges which include: (i) unequal access 

to and control over resources such as agriculture support services, appropriate technology – about 0.9% 

of females in rural areas own tractors in comparison with 2.6% of males; (ii) rural women’s workload - 

family welfare and subsistence agriculture functions increase due to rural-urban migration of men; and 

(iii) inadequate representation in structures of decision making, at community levels - only 10% of 

women head traditional authorities. 

 

3.2.5. Equitable agricultural mechanization in the agriculture value chain will therefore contribute to 
addressing some of the challenges faced by women farmers. Equitable distribution of equipment will 

contribute to higher production levels and reduce the drudgery that women face through non mechanized 

agriculture. Current figures indicate that women form majority of members of seed multiplication, crop 

production and marketing cooperatives. Women will participate as individuals or members of 

cooperatives. The Project will promote: (i) equitable access to farm equipment by women; (ii) training 

female farmers to increase the uptake of technology and mechanization, and in the maintenance of the 



 

12 

 

equipment (at least 50% for female farmers); and (iii) women’s participation in leadership of 

cooperatives. 

 

3.2.6. Social: NAMSIP is aimed at addressing some of the major limiting factors to increased food 
security and sustainable agricultural production through provision of agricultural mechanisation and 

improvement of seeds which will result in multiple socio-economic benefits including contributing to 

improved household income, enhanced food security and nutrition, and increased rural employment. 

The Project will also result in social risks, safety and security concerns related to the increased use of 

machinery and equipment which will be addressed and minimized through implementation of the 

ESMP’s mitigation measures. 

3.2.7. HIV/AIDS: According to the 2015 National HIV sentinel survey, out of the population of over 
2.2 million people, about 210,000 to 230,000 people (10.5%) are living with HIV and the virus 

prevalence is highest among women aged 35-39 years at 32.3%, and women aged 45-49 years at 31.6%. 

The survey highlighted a higher prevalence in rural areas than in urban areas. The most affected Regions 

are Zambezi (23.7%), Omusati (17.4%), Kavango (17%), Oshana (16.1%) and Ohangwena (15.6%). 

Consequently, HIV/AIDS campaigns will be mainstreamed in the implementation of the Project, 

targeting beneficiaries including civil works contractors and consultants. The farmer cooperatives will 

be used to deliver HIV/AIDS awareness messages to the communities. 

 

3.2.8. Inclusive Growth: In the context of broad-based and pro-poor growth, the Project will promote 
inclusive growth with equitable allocation of resources to activities which will benefit all levels of the 

participating communities. In particular, NAMSIP will be implemented in rural areas which (i) have 

very poor households, (ii) are frequently affected by drought, and (iii) have food shortages during some 

months of the year and are consequently nutritionally vulnerable. The Project will assist poor rural men, 

women and youth to participate in planned agricultural activities for increasing productivity, job 

creation, and income generation. 

 

3.2.9. Food Security and Nutrition: Namibia’s food security and nutrition have been weakened by 
severe droughts leading to a number of households depending on market and Relief Food Programmes. 

Namibia produces about 40% of the food it consumes and is highly dependent on imports (60%), mainly 

from South Africa. According to NDP5, poverty is a major factor limiting access to food. Access to 

food in Namibia is affected by reliance on market purchases for food. When combined with the heavy 

reliance on food imports, it makes Namibia vulnerable to high food prices. Overall, the production scale 

of smallholder farmers is lower which is attributed to limited access to inputs, poor soils, access to land 

and frequent occurrence of natural disasters such a drought and flood. For 2016/2017 cropping season, 

MAWF has estimated below average cereal crop production of 75,300 tonnes. Considering that the 

annual national cereal consumption is about 326,500 tonnes, this leaves a huge deficit of 251,200 tonnes. 

Based on the number of food insecure rural people, the Project will scale up irrigated agriculture, dry 

land crop production intervention and promote food security resilience measures through the provision 

of agricultural machinery, equipment and improved seeds at subsidized rates for drought affected 

farmers. Nationwide, the stunting rate for children under 5 is between 24% and 30%. Malnutrition 

continues to blemish the future of children, with an average of 1 out of every 4 children under the age 

of 5 more likely to be stunted. Stunted growth is strongly associated with poor living conditions, 

household food insecurity, poor breastfeeding practices and inappropriate foods for children. The 

Project will support the Government’s efforts on (i) nutrition, especially, breastfeeding awareness 

campaigns, and (ii) expansion of the existing infant (6-24 months) feeding programmes within the 

NAMSIP communities. To that effect, the Project interventions will also lead to increase appropriate 

knowledge and practices regarding infant, young child and maternal nutrition with the aim of 

contributing to SDG #2 target. With regards to nutrition, NAMSIP will promote the Government’s 

feeding programme (1,000 days from pregnancy to two years) in order to reduce malnutrition and 

child/women morbidity. Promotion of availability, accessibility, and consumption of a variety of foods 

will strengthen the capacity of women and households to adopt the optimal nutritional practices. 

Sensitization on water related diseases will help to improve the health of the population.  



 

13 

 

 

3.2.10. The modernization of agriculture through agricultural mechanization for cereal crops and 
livestock production will contribute to overall increase in food production in the country. This will result 

into 40% reduction of the country’s imports of grains/cereal crops which is currently estimated at 60% 

for grain/cereals every year according to MAWF/FAO reports (2016). The use of mechanization will 

also enhance the value of the products and industrialization of the agriculture sector since some of the 

livestock and livestock products will be exported.  

 

3.2.11. Involuntary Resettlement: There will be no involuntary resettlement or land acquisition 
envisioned during implementation of Project activities. The agricultural mechanization and seed system 

development activities will be carried out in beneficiaries’ fields or public land which will benefit 

individual farmers and cooperative members. 

 

IV. IMPLEMENTATION 

 

4.1. Implementation Arrangements 

 

4.1.1. MAWF will be the Executing Agency (EA) of the Project which will be implemented, over a 
period of 5 years, using the existing Government structures. At National Level, the existing Programme 

Steering Committee (PSC) comprises (i) Presidential Advisor - Policy Implementation and Monitoring, 

as the Chairperson; (ii) Presidential Advisor - Constitutional Affairs and Private Sector Interface; (iii) 

Presidential Advisor - Economic, and (iv) Permanent Secretary (PS)-Ministry of Finance (MoF). MoF 

will serve as the secretariat of the PSC. This is in line with the Government’s wish to have oversight 

responsibility, at the highest level, for NAMSIP and also the Transport and Education Sectors’ projects 

which have been appraised concurrently, under the Bank’s current support to the country. The PS-

MAWF shall be co-opted when the PSC is deliberating issues concerning agriculture sector. The PSC 

will meet on semi-annual basis, and as need arises, in order to (a) approve annual work plan and budget, 

(b) review progress reports, and (c) provide overall policy and strategic direction of NAMSIP. At Sector 

level, the existing HACCIADEP Coordination Team (HCT) consists of MAWF’s (i) PS, (ii) Deputy PS 

(Department of Agricultural Development), and the Directors of: (iii) Directorate of Planning and 

Business Development, (iv) Directorate of Agricultural Production Extensions and Engineering 

Services, (v) Directorate of Agricultural Research and Development, and (vi) Directorate of Veterinary 

Services. The HCT will (i) give the overall sectoral guidance to NAMSIP, (ii) approve Project 

information to be uploaded on MAWF website, and (iii) approve quarterly progress reports (QPRs). The 

MAWF DPBD will be the secretariat of HCT. The HCT has already appointed: (1) members of the 

Project Implementing Unit (PIU) comprising the (a) Project Coordinator, (b) Accountant, (c) Monitoring 

and Evaluation (M&E) Specialist, and (d) Procurement Specialist who will be in charge of day-to-day 

Project implementation; (2) focal points/desk officers (existing MAWF staff) from each Directorate; 

and (3) a focal point (existing senior-level MAWF staff) in each of the 14 participating Regions. The 

PIU staff will spend, at least, 90% of their official time on NAMSIP activities. The Project Coordinator 

will report to the Deputy-PS (Agriculture). The PIU will work closely with the Government appointed 

focal points in the (i) Directorate of Planning and Business Development (DPBD), (ii) Directorate of 

Agricultural Production Extensions and Engineering Services (DAPEES), (iii) Directorate of 

Agricultural Research and Development (DARD), (iv) Directorate of Veterinary Services (DVS), and 

(v) Nutrition Unit. The DAPEES and DVS will be responsible for sub-component 1.1 (Agricultural 

Mechanisation) and DARD will be responsible for sub-component 1.2 (Certified Seed Systems 

Improvement). The DAPEES and DARD will be supported by 3 Technical Advisors (Cereal Crops, 

Livestock and Seed Systems) who will be competitively recruited by the Project, based on Bank’s Rules 

and Procedures. Based on the value chain approach, including construction activities, the PIU will be 

supported by SOEs, namely, (i) AgriBusDev Agency, (ii) AMTA, (iii) AgriBank, and (iv) Namibia 

Agronomic Board (NAB). The PIU will also work closely with the Namibia National Farmers Union 

(NNFU). 

 



 

14 

 

4.1.2. The NAMSIP Component 1 will mainly be implemented through farmer cooperatives or 
individual farmers who will be required to save part of their income in a group bank account. The 

cooperatives and individuals, with the assistance of MAWF, AgriBusDev and AMTA, will identify 

appropriate machinery/equipment for their operations based on their needs. A qualifying 

cooperative/farmer will be expected to directly pay about 10% of the overall cost of the associated 

machinery/equipment from their own resources. Procurement of standard machinery/equipment will 

commence in Project Year 1. 

 

4.1.3. Procurement Arrangements:  Procurement of goods, works and the acquisition of consulting 
services, financed by the Bank for the Project, will be carried out in accordance with the “Procurement 

Policy and Methodology for Bank Group Funded Operations” (BPM), dated October 2015 and 

following the provisions stated in the Financing Agreement. Specifically, procurement will be carried 

out using the following: 

 Borrower Procurement System (BPS): Specific Procurement Methods and Procedures (PMPs) 
under BPS comprising its Laws and Regulations, Procurement Act of 2015 and Public 

Procurement Regulation (no. 2016), using the national Standard Solicitation Documents (SSDs) 

or other Solicitation Documents agreed during project negotiations” for various group of 

transactions to be entailed under the project.   

 Bank Procurement Methods and Procedures (Bank’s PMPs): The Project will use Bank 
standard PMPs, using the relevant Bank Standard   Solicitation Documents SDDs, for contracts 

that are either: (i) Contracts procurement under Open Competitive Bidding (OCB)–international; 

Limited Competitive Bidding (LIB) and Consultancy services of firms; (ii) in case BPS is not 

relied upon for a specific transaction or group of transactions; and (iii) in case Bank’s PMPs have 

been found to be the best fit for purpose for a specific transaction or group of transactions. 

 

4.1.4. Procurement Risks and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): the assessment of procurement risks at 
the Country, Sector, and Project levels and of procurement capacity at the Executing Agency (EA), were 

undertaken  for the project and the output have informed the decisions on the procurement regimes (BPS 

or Bank’s PMPs)  being used for specific transactions or groups of similar transactions under the project. 

The appropriate risks mitigation measures have been included in PAR Volume II, Technical Annex B.5. 

Various items under different expenditure categories and related procurement arrangements have been 

developed for goods, works and consultancy services, as reflected in PAR Volume II, Technical Annex 

B.5. 

 

4.1.5. Financial Management (FM): An assessment of the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry 
(MAWF) as Project Executing Agency (that included a review of the budgeting, accounting, treasury 

systems, internal controls, reporting, and external audit arrangements) was done to ascertain effective 

financial management of the project. The Department of Finance headed by a Director of Finance within 

the MAWF is responsible for the function of planning and budgeting at central and local levels including 

recording expenditures and maintaining assets through the use of the Government-wide IFMIS. The 

system has, however, not been configured to enable comprehensive Project reporting, therefore, a 

suitable system that will include the use of spreadsheets will be used for supplementing the recording 

and reporting of the Project transactions. The MAWF staff (Finance Department) have been involved 

in implementation of donor (EU, FAO, JICA and South-South Cooperation China) funded projects. 

Given the fiduciary requirements related to the Bank’s financing, MAWF has already appointed a well-

qualified Project Accountant to handle Project financial management (FM) tasks.  The Project 

Accountant will work together with other PIU members including Project Coordinator, M&E, and 

Procurement Specialist. Training in Bank requirements regarding financial management will be 

provided as part of project launching and during implementation.   

4.1.6. Internal audit function at the Ministry will cover the project, the reports resulting from the audits 
will be shared with the Bank during supervisions. All deficiencies identified by internal audits will be 

communicated in a timely manner to the Government, for action. The PIU will also be responsible for 

ensuring compliance with the Bank’s reporting requirements, regarding the submission of periodic 



 

15 

 

progress reports with financial information for the Bank loan and Government contribution to the Bank 

not later than 45 days after the end of the respective quarter. The PIU will also be required to produce 

annual project financial statements. The Ministry’s financial statements are audited annually by the 

Auditor General of Namibia.  In this regard, the Project financial statements will also be subject to audit 

by the AG (or a private independent audit firm under the oversight of the AG) with the audit done in 

accordance with a Bank approved Terms of Reference. The audit reports (including management letter) 

will be submitted to the Bank within six months after the end of the reporting period with costs of the 

audit borne by the loan. These arrangements are in line with the current moderate country fiduciary risk 

levels after mitigation factors. 

 

4.1.7. The overall conclusion of the assessment is that the MAWF’s capacity, to handle all the FM 
aspects of the project, currently meets the Bank’s minimum requirements as laid out in the Bank’s FM 

guidelines. In addition, with the implementation of the proposed FM actions, there will be further 

improvement in the Project financial management systems to ensure funds to be made available to 

finance Project activities would be used economically, efficiently and for the purpose intended. The 

overall initial FM risk for the Project is assessed as “Moderate”. This is also in line with current country 

fiduciary risk levels that allow the use of existing systems subject to their satisfactory assessment. The 

detailed analysis and financial management arrangements are contained in PAR Volume II, Technical 

Annex B.4. 

 

4.1.8. Disbursement arrangements: Disbursement of funds under the project shall be primarily by the 
Direct Payment method for the activities under the project. The PIU will be responsible for certification 

of invoices submitted and preparation of disbursement application which will be reviewed and signed 

off by Government designated staff and submitted to the Bank for payment. The Special Account 

method to be managed by the PIU will be limited to financing the smaller and recurring operating 

expenses. The opening of the Special Account denominated in ZAR together with the associated local 

currency account denominated in NAD will be “other condition” to the Loan. In addition, the 

Reimbursement method will also be available. All disbursements under the Loan would be made in 

accordance with the Bank’s rules and procedures as laid out in the Disbursement Handbook, as 

applicable. In addition, the Bank will issue a Disbursement Letter whose contents were discussed and 

agreed upon during the loan negotiations meeting between the delegations from the Government of 

Namibia and the Bank. 

 

4.2.  Monitoring  

 

The Project monitoring will be at different levels with the highest level being the NPC. NPC has 

developed an M&E framework that guides various sectors and assists to monitor the HPP and NDP5 

Results Framework. In addition, the Namibia Statistics Agency (NSA) will assist the Project to carry 

out regular surveys. At Sector level, the DPBD will have the overall responsibility for Project monitoring 

and evaluation activities. The Project activities will commence with preparation of AWP&B (based on 

detailed cost tables/DCTs, PAR Volume II Technical Annex B.2), which will be submitted to the PSC 

for approval, before transmission to the Bank. The Project M&E Specialist will establish participatory 

M&E system based on performance indicators. If need be, a short term individual consultant will be 

recruited by the Project to develop the participatory M&E system which will be linked to NPC M&E 

framework. The Project has allocated financial resources to facilitate training on data collection, 

processing and reporting. In Project Year 1, the PIU will develop the Project Implementation Manual 

highlighting the organisation, implementation, financial, disbursement and procurement arrangements. 

The Regional Project launch workshops will be organised by MAWF for key stakeholders with the 

purpose of (i) ensuring that all partners understand the Project components, subcomponents, activities, 

implementation modalities, and reporting needs, and (ii) acting as a networking event to build 

relationships for future knowledge sharing. All spending Regions will submit monthly reports for 

compilation of Quarterly Progress Report (QPRs). All QPRs will be reviewed and cleared by HCT 

before submission to the Bank, not more than 45 days after the end of reporting period. The key Project 



 

16 

 

M&E milestones/reports are presented in Table 4.2. The Bank will monitor NAMSIP implementation 

through supervision missions, at least twice per calendar year, in order to verify progress and monitor 

key verifiable indicators.

4.3. Governance  
 

4.3.1. Namibia is one of the countries with the best governance record in Africa and has continually 
been ranked within the top ten performers on the Mo-Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG), 

which measures the quality of governance in every African country. Namibia has been ranking 6th since 

2000 and improving to 5th in 2015 (2016 IIAG report) based on 4 categories of governance, namely, (a) 

Safety & Rule of Law (score 76.1/100, rank 4th/54), (b) Participation and Human Rights (score 76.1/100, 

rank 2nd/54), (c) Sustainable Economic Opportunity (score 62.2/100, rank 7th/54), and (d) Human 

Development (score 64.7/100, rank 10th/54). The 2013 Corruption Perception Index by Transparency 

International ranked Namibia as the 7th least corrupt country in sub-Saharan Africa. In January 2017, 

Namibia unconditionally acceded to the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), which provides for 

self and peer-assessment of governance policies and practices in Africa. 

 

4.3.2. To achieve inclusive and sustainable development, Namibia has put in place strong 
accountability systems in line with the Constitution and the State Finance Act of 1991 (amended 1995). 

The Minister of Finance presents accountability report, together with other budget documents, at the 

National Assembly every year. The Country’s efforts to reform the Public Financial Management (PFM) 

system are yielding results. This is testified by a transparent, consultative, and inclusive fiscal budgetary 

process that is succeeded by well-controlled and coordinated budget execution mechanisms, which have 

resulted in the decline in public sector over-expenditures. The modernization of the public procurement 

system is being pursued through the new Public Procurement Act 2015, which became effective on 1st 

April 2017, following issuance of Regulations. The Constitution clearly defines the legal and 

institutional framework for the fight against corruption. The Namibia Anti-Corruption Commission, 

established under the Anti-Corruption Act No. 8 of 2003, is mandated to combat and prevent corruption. 

The 2016 Corruption Perception Index ranks Namibia 53 out of 176 countries, with an overall score of 

52/100. The agriculture sector will benefit from AfDB-funded PBO reforms through (i) strengthened 

PFM and SOE efficiency; and (ii) improved business enabling environment, which are expected to result 

in higher GDP growth rates, and reduction in unemployment and poverty. NAMSIP institutional 

arrangement has been designed to ensure good governance, and will serve as an instrument for achieving 

intended objectives. The Project’s specific governance risk mitigation measures include (i) recruitment 

of external audit firm, and (ii) training of PIU in Bank’s rules and procedures. 

  



 

17 

 

4.4.  Sustainability 
 

The Project has been designed in a participatory and consultative manner in order to enhance 

ownership by beneficiaries thus ensuring sustainability. The Project will be implemented using the 

existing Government structures and SOEs, with minimal outsourced technical assistance, which will 

assist to preserve the institutional memory and also build the capacity of the Government staff to ably 

assist the smallholder farmers during and after Project implementation (operation and maintenance) 

period. The Project’s focus on seed system development and agriculture mechanization will enhance 

Private Sector involvement, with good back-up service. Major maintenance of machinery and equipment 

will be carried out by the suppliers and the cooperatives will be paying for the services. Through the 

cooperatives, the beneficiaries will be mobilised and trained to properly operate and carry out routine 

maintenance of the agricultural machinery and equipment. The capacity building for MAWF staff and 

cooperatives will guarantee sustainability of planned activities when the Project phases out. The certified 

seed processing plant including associated equipment will be operated and maintained by the 

cooperatives (Private Sector) for sustainability. Behaviour communication and awareness campaigns 

for food diversification and nutritional interventions have been mainstreamed to build resilience and 

sustainability of the investments. The Project is financially viable and the analysis indicated that 

beneficiaries will be able to generate adequate funds for their household needs, as well as sustain the 

investments made in the agriculture ventures.  
 

4.5 Risk Management 

 
No Potential Risks Rating Mitigation Measures 

1.  Poor sustainability of irrigation 
schemes and certified seeds 

processing plant. 

Medium Project, through cooperatives, will facilitate 

establishment of management entity. The certified 

seed processing plant will be managed by the Private 

Sector. 

2.  Project implementation delays. Low Regular and close follow up by the NPC, HCT and 
Bank.  

3.  Drastic weather 
variations/climatic conditions. 

Medium Dryland/rainfed Project activities with be 

implemented together with conservation agriculture 

based on cropping schedule so that little amount of 

rainfall can fully be utilised by the crops. 
 

4.6 Knowledge Building   
 

4.6.1. The Project’s agricultural mechanization will scale-up the existing MAWF Dry Land Crop 
Production Programme subsidy-mechanisation programme but using a concept of ownership scheme 

which will generate considerable knowledge on access and sustainable use of modern farm 

machinery/equipment. The focus on livestock disease control will also generate lessons for future 

interventions to enhance livestock animal health, traceability, and productivity. The lessons and 

experiences from NAMSIP will be shared within the Bank and other institutions interested in 

implementing future similar projects. The value chain approach for both crops and livestock production 

will generate information on profitability and sustainability of agricultural investments. The 

establishment of certified seed processing plant to be managed by the Private Sector and cooperatives 

will also provide lessons on how the small-scale farmers’ cooperatives can be integrated into the 

certified seed production value chain.  
 

4.6.2. The Project will contribute to knowledge building through: (i) the M&E system which will be 
designed to generate information on implementation achievements, Project financing, disbursement 

trends, procurement, contractor performance, beneficiary participation, Project outputs and outcomes 

and sustainability; (ii) lessons learnt from supervision mission reports, MTR and PCR; and (iii) 

beneficiary impact assessment and final stakeholders’ workshop will provide feedback on key lessons 

and experiences. NAMSIP will provide an opportunity to strengthen the Bank’s knowledge on the 

agriculture sector in Namibia. Above that, the Project has incorporated specialised training which will 

help to build knowledge, skills and capacity of MAWF staff, cooperatives members and other individual 

beneficiaries.  



 

18 

 

4.6.3. Documentation and sharing of lessons, experience (successes and failures) and good practice 
will be carried out continuously during and after Project implementation. Depending upon the need, 

appropriate support (print and electronic media) and several communication channels (such as 

newspapers, mobile-phone-SMS, radio, TV and billboards) will be used in order to boost visibility. The 

Project-related online information will also be available on the existing Government/MAWF website 

which will be regularly posted after approval by HCT.

Alignment with  

Bank  

Priorities 

 

PAGPA is aligned with the national development programme, SCAPE 2013-2017, 

notably Pillar (I) development of sectors with strong growth potential and Pillar 

(IV) strengthening governance. It is also aligned with the two pillars of the Bank's 

CSP (2016-2020), namely: (i) Development of inclusive growth and agribusiness 

competitiveness poles and (ii) Support for financial, sector and local governance 

and the Bank's 2013-2022 Ten-year Strategy as well as the Bank's Governance 

Action Plan (GAP II 2014-2018), more specifically, it contributes to the 

achievement of three of the Bank's five key strategic priorities (i) "Feed Africa," 

(ii) "Industrialize Africa" through agro-industry promotion measures, and (iii) 

"Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa" by supporting reforms seeking 

improved budget management and public action effectiveness through enhanced 

economic and financial governance. 

 

Needs  

Assessment and  

Programme  

Rationale 

 

The encouraging socio-economic performance notwithstanding, Togo remains in 

fragile situation due mainly to the wide spatial disparities in wealth generation and 

distribution. Economic activity remains mainly concentrated in the maritime 

region which generates on average 97% of the tax revenues collected by the OTR, 

against merely 2% for the other regions representing 89% of the territory and 57% 

of the population. To boost its resilience and accelerate its exit from fragility, Togo 

is banking on the structural transformation of the agricultural sector, notably 

through the establishment of agriculture hubs (Agropoles) for economic as well as 

social inclusion reasons. The effective implementation of this strategy requires 

mobilizing substantial investments, both public and private. The total cost estimate 

for the 2016-2020 phase is CFAF 3,791 billion, with an average financing ratio of 

46% from the State budget and 56% from the private sector. PAGPA, by 

concomitantly supporting substantial increase in internal resources, improving the 

private investment climate and strengthening agricultural sector governance, will 

provide Togo with the required financial and technical capabilities to implement 

its agricultural policy, a vehicle for sustainable and inclusive growth. Additionally, 

budget support resources will cover some of the financing requirements of the 

2017 budget, amounting to CFAF 400.6 billion. 

Harmonization Efforts are still required to coordinate the interventions of technical and financial 

partners (TFPs), in particular those engaging in budget support. The budget support 

consultation framework (COAB) set up since 2010, remains inoperative. The TFPs 

are yet to develop a joint matrix of their interventions, for which agreement with 

the government is awaited regarding its orientation, but they are working to 



v  

strengthen the complementarity of their actions in terms of dialogue and reforms 

monitoring. 
 

Bank’s Value  

Added 

 

The Bank has acquired proven expertise in strengthening economic and financial 

governance in Africa, notably in the sub-region (WAEMU). More specifically, the 

Bank has a comparative advantage in Togo for dialogue on reforms, having been 

the first development partner to re-engage after more than 15 years of dialogue 

with the international community; and on account of the results obtained in highly 

strategic areas such as revenue mobilization. Indeed, the Bank lent its full support 

to Togo in its vast and ambitious tax transition project that led to the establishment 

of OTR. PAGPA supports complementary measures to complete reforms seeking 

to optimize this structure, and diversify the economy by creating an enabling 

environment for the establishment of Agropoles. 

Contribution to 

Gender Equality 

and Women’s 

Empowerment  

Increased domestic resources mobilization and greater efficiency in public finance 

management will help improve the living conditions of the people in general and 

women in particular. PAGPA measures will lay the groundwork for a structural 

transformation of the economy, particularly at the local and regional level. The 

numerous opportunities that will open up around major Agropole projects will 

benefit women. In particular, that of the Kara region, the first pilot Agropole to be 

established with the support of this programme should, by 2020, help create 2,500 

jobs, 30% for women and 65% for the youth.  

 

Dialogue on 

Policies and  

Associated 

Technical 

Assistance  

 

 

PAGPA will help reinforce dialogue with the Government on public policies to 

support Togo’s economic transformation. The dialogue will focus on conditions 

for the effective implementation of the agricultural policy, with special focus on 

issues related to broadening the tax base to maximize domestic resources 

mobilization, thus strengthening macro-stability and creating a private investment-

friendly environment. Through ongoing capacity-building projects, the Resource 

Mobilization and institutional capacity building support project (PAMOCI) and 

the Fiscal Governance Support Project (PAGFI), Togo will continue to benefit 

from the assistance of national and international experts in revenue mobilization. 

The implementation of the agribusiness reforms will be supported by the 

investment project being prepared by the department in charge of agriculture in the 

Bank, which is aimed at establishing the Kara Agropole. The submission of this 

project to the Bank's Board of Directors is scheduled for December 2017.

1  

I. INTRODUCTION - THE PROPOSAL. 

1.1 Management submits the following proposal and recommendation for a grant of 

UA 7.21 million from Transition Support Facility (TSF) resources, and a grant of UA 2.32 

million from African Development Fund (ADF) resources, to the Republic of Togo to 

finance the Governance and Agribusiness Promotion Support Programme (PAGBA). 

PAGPA supports reforms aimed at creating a private and public investment environment 

conducive to agribusiness promotion, and improving revenue mobilization notably for capital 

investment purposes. It is designed as a reform operation funded by a budget support of 

total amount of UA 9.53 million to be disbursed in a single tranche in 2017. 

1.2 Single tranche disbursement, was justify by the particularity of 2017 fiscal year 

situation, which presents a high level of need for concessional financing mainly due to Togo's 

limited access to borrowing resources;  this is in accordance to the Government commitments 

under the framework of the economic program (2017-2019) supported by the IMF's Extended 

Credit Facility approved in May 2017. It also emerges from the revised budget prepared 

following the conclusion of the program with IMF, an overall need for financing gap of 280.8 

CFAF billions excluding grants, part of which will be financed by the ADF and TAF grant 

resources. On account of this financial support for Togo's budget, social sector allocations will 

be maintained, thus minimizing risks of the social climate deteriorating at this crucial 

transitional phase towards exiting fragility. With the programme spanning the November 2017 

to December 2018 period, the Bank will maintain sustained dialogue with the Togolese 

authorities for the effective implementation of the reforms scheduled for 2018. These reforms 

will be monitored in close collaboration with the IMF, World Bank and European Union whose 

programmes cover the 2017-2019 period. 

1.3 Despite the favourable outlook, Togo remains confronted with a number of socio-

economic challenges, including inadequate internal resources and an underperforming 

economy with low and non-inclusive value added creation. Despite efforts by GoT and the 

structural reforms implemented in recent years, including the creation of the OTR and the 

adoption of a new customs code, internal resources mobilization remains low compared to the 

financing requirements of the Accelerated Growth and Employment Promotion Strategy 

(SCAPE). The operationalization of the OTR, which is strongly supported by the Bank, has 

definitely yielded encouraging results, with a tax burden of 17.9% in 2016 that is expected to 

reach 18.3% in 2017 and 19.1% in 2018. However, despite this positive trend, on account of 

Togo's weak capacity to create value-added with one of Africa’s lowest GDPs, the absolute 

value of domestic revenues collected falls far short of the budget’s funding requirements. The 

average coverage rate of budgetary spending by tax revenue is about 60%, hence its heavy 

dependence on external financing and public borrowing both internally and externally. Indeed 

since 2016, Togo's debt risk is considered high with a debt ratio of 80.8% of GDP. In this regard, 

GoT has committed, under the new programme with the IMF, to lowering this rate to not more 

than 73% by 2019. 

 

 



2  

1.4 In a bid to maintain medium and long-term viability of the macro-fiscal 

framework, Togo is banking on the structural transformation of the agricultural sector 

to give sustained and inclusive impetus to accelerated economic growth. To leverage this 

sector as a prime mover of economic growth and social inclusion, the country has formulated 

and adopted an agricultural policy (2015-2030) aimed at achieving "a modern, sustainable and 

high value-added agriculture to support a strong, inclusive, competitive economy generating 

decent and stable employment by 2030". The country’s agriculture sector employs 60-70% of 

the working population and accounts for up to 38% of GDP. This sector has significant potential 

with 3.4 million hectares of arable land, of which only 45% is currently under cultivation 

yielding less than 50% of the optimum level. Furthermore, the industrial processing of 

agricultural products is in its infancy, as is the Togolese industrial sector as a whole. Over the 

last three years, the industrial sector, which is not well developed and is poorly integrated with 

the rest of the economy, contributed an average of 17.8% to GDP, with an average annual 

growth rate of 1.3%. PAGPA is a continuation of the Bank's previous PARG-II budget support 

and will allow more in-depth reforms focusing on strengthening public finance management 

and creating conditions conducive to agro-industry development. 

1.5 PAGPA is aligned with Togo's national development policies and contributes 

towards implementing the Bank's intervention strategies in Togo. PAGPA is in line with 

the national development agenda, SCAPE 2013-2017, particularly Pillar (I) "development of 

sectors with strong growth potential" and Pillar (IV) "strengthening governance". It is also 

aligned with the two pillars of the Bank's CSP (2016-2020), namely: “Development of inclusive 

growth and agribusiness competitiveness poles” and (ii) “Support for financial, sector and local 

governance”. It is also consistent with the Bank's ten-year strategy 2013-2022 and the 

Governance Action Plan (GAP II 2014-2018). More specifically, it is aimed at contributing to 

the achievement of three of the Bank's High-5s: (i) "Feed Africa", (ii) "Industrialize Africa" 

and (iii) "Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa". 

1.6 In accordance with the Bank's Policy on Budget Support Operations, this proposed 

operation is subject to consideration by the Board following the implementation of the agreed 

prior actions, which are fully consistent with the reform programme of the Government of Togo 

(GoT), designed in consultation with civil society and the country's technical and financial 

partners. 

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT 

2.1 Political Situation and Governance Context 

2.1.1 Political Situation: The 2015 presidential election which was won by the Presidential 

Party, and intensified dialogue between the ruling party and the opposition, contributed towards 

easing the political climate up to the end of the first half of 2017. This relative political stability 

has been conducive to the implementation of structural reforms for a progressive exit from the 

situation of fragility. However, the August 2017 political demonstrations, with sporadic 

violence, indicate that the dialogue during the budget support programme period could unfold 

in the context marked by tension arising from the holding of the legislative elections in 2018, 

local elections in 2019 and the presidential election in 2020. 



3  

2.1.2 Fragility Situation: Despite the progress achieved in recent years, particularly in 

economic terms, Togo remains in a fragile situation. Its average score in the Bank's and World 

Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) is 3.2 out of 6. The reconstruction 

process following the political-democratic crisis is still ongoing. The North-South ethnic and 

regional divide continues to fuel the radicalization of the divergent positions among the political 

class and recurrent social tensions. The ownershipof sustainable mechanisms of socio-political 

dialogue, that is courteous, inclusive and constructive among the political class and the elite as 

well as the strengthening of institutions, constitute major challenges that Togo will face in terms 

of political governance. Moreover, the economy’s extremely heavy dependence on the 

phosphate sub-sector (over 40% of export earnings), and on revenues from port and airport 

traffic, also constitutes a source of fragility, as do the persistent spatial socio-economic 

development and gender disparities. The new development-oriented national agricultural policy 

has the dual objective of diversifying the economy and reducing inequalities in opportunities 

between the maritime region and other regions; and between men and women, by facilitating 

women's access to land through the provisions of the new land code that is in the process of 

adoption. 

2.1.3 Governance: According to the 2016 Mo Ibrahim report on the assessment of global 

governance in Africa, Togo ranks 33rd among 54 countries evaluated with a score of 48.5 out 

of 100. Notwithstanding its poor overall ranking, Togo, with an average change of +9.7 points,  

ranks 2nd  best governance reformer over the period 2006-2015, behind Côte d'Ivoire (13.1), the 

same as Zimbabwe (+9.7) and ahead of Liberia (+8.7), and Rwanda (+8.4). It is the only country 

whose overall governance has improved steadily with progress in each of the 14 sub-categories 

of the IIAG. The 2016 report by Transparency International ranks Togo 116th  out of 176 with 

a Corruption Perception Index (CPI) of 32 against 29 in 2014, on a scale of 0 (high corruption) 

to 100 (very low corruption). 

2.2 Recent Economic Developments, Macroeconomic and Fiscal Analysis 

2.2.1 The country is characterized by limited transformation of its economy, which is 

dominated by agriculture with 47.6% of GDP, followed by services (36.2%) and industry 

(16.2%)with merely 6.4% for manufacturing. However, despite a challenging external 

environment, the Togolese authorities were able to maintain a positive trend of economic 

activity. Indeed, the GDP growth rate, which was 6.1% in 2013, remained at an average of 5.4% 

over the period 2014-2016 due to the good performance of the agriculture and infrastructure 

investment sectors. This trend is expected to continue in 2017, with a growth rate of about 5.0% 

which could reach 5.3% by 2018, due to the combined effects of fairly good rainfall and 

increased productivity arising from the agricultural sector’s transformation and the improved 

transportation system. Inflation is also contained through the stabilization of food, energy and 

transport prices. It dropped from 1.8% in 2015 to 0.9% in 2016 and is projected to be negative 

at -0.1% for 2017. An analysis conducted in 2016 by the IMF and World Bank shows that Togo 

is at high overall debt risk. 

 

 



4  

2.2.2 The country's debt risk level is deemed extremely worrying. The public debt stock 

rose sharply from 48.8% at end- 2010 to 80.8% of GDP at end- 2016, above the Community 

norm of 70%. This increase is due mainly to infrastructure investments in 2015 and 2016. 

Togo's new programme (2017-2019) under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) with the IMF 

seeks mainly to create conditions conducive to a substantial public debt level reduction from 

80.8% of GDP in 2016 to 67.8% by 2020.1

Source : National administrations; calculations by the authors & IMF staff report article IV May 2017 

2.2.3 The budget deficit (cash basis) deteriorated progressively over the period 2013-

2016. It reached a record 9.6% of GDP in 2016,2 against 5.8%, 7.9% and 7.8% of GDP 

respectively in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Such deterioration in the budget balance is due mainly to 

a sharp increase in the aforementioned infrastructure spendings, and high cost of commitments 

under the "pre-financing" method used by the country to finance them. This deficit is projected 

at 4.9% in 2017 and should improve slightly to 4.7% in 2018 with the discontinuation of the 

pre-financing practice at end- 2016 and the renegotiation of the terms of the related 

commitments in 2017. The external current account balance is structurally in deficit, standing 

at CFAF 142.5 billion in 2016. It could rise to CFAF -140.5 billion in 2017, representing an 

improvement of CFAF 2 billion, attributable to an increased services balance (+ CFAF 4.1 

billion) and secondary revenues (+ CFAF 1.2 billion), which is cushioned by the decrease in 

the goods trade balance (CFAF -4.0 billion). 

2.2.4 The outlook is deemed favourable. The combined effects of support for the 

modernization of agro-industry, including Agropoles and extractive industries, and the 

envisaged reforms to strengthen competition rules in the hospitality, electricity, banking and 

telecommunications sectors, should help achieve an average growth rate of 5.3% over the 

period 2017-2019. Additionally, lessons learned from the implementation of budgets (2012-

2016) and the implementation of the programme with the IMF under the Extended Credit 

Facility (2017-2019) should lead to improved budget credibility and stability. 

2.2.5 Competitiveness of the Economy    

The Togolese economy’s competitiveness is structurally constrained by low overall 

productivity and high production costs. In the report Doing Business 2018 Togo loses two 
places compared to 2017 and ranks the 156th. Similarly, although the labour force has grown 

through improved education, physical capital accumulation has stagnated since the 1990s, 

contributing to a steady decline in overall factor productivity. However, significant progress is

being made by Togo in the international transport sector, which is crucial to improving its 

competitiveness. Mention can be made of (i) the 700 km trans-Togo road, (ii) the coastal back 

road (54 km), (iii) the modernization and extension of the port of Lomé, whose capacity has 

increased from 0.5 to 2 million containers per year, and (iv) the construction of a new airport 

in line with international standards. These impactful infrastructures, as well as their 

geographical position, represent opportunities that reinforce Togo's objective of becoming, in 

the medium term, one of the best performing logistics hubs in the region, given its current 

comparative advantage in that domain. In that regard, the World Bank's 2016 report on the 

logistics performance index (published every two years) shows that Togo has climbed 47 

positions, from 139th out of 160 to 92nd, and remarkably 64 positions on the "Speed" indicator, 

measured by shipment forwarding to freight forwarder times or  expected goods to port delivery 

times. 

2.3 Public Finance Management   

2.3.1 Since 2010, the Government has had a National Finance Reform Strategy with a 

Public Finance Management Reform Plan (PA-RGFP), the implementation of which is 

considered generally satisfactory although subject to improvement. Following the PEFA and 

PEMFAR conducted in 2008-2009, which revealed Togo’s extremely weak public finance 

management system, GoT in September 2010 adopted a public finance management reform 

strategy for the period 2010-2020, with an action plan (PA-RGFP) implemented on a sliding 

triennial basis. The PEFA and PEMFAR evaluations conducted in 2016 show that Togo has 

made significant efforts to put in place budget management tools and procedures that are 

good enough to restore public finance sustainability. 

2.3.2 Regarding budget preparation, the budget nomenclature in force (former WAEMU 

1998 standards) is considered adequate to ensure budgetary transparency. The new 

nomenclature, which complies with the new WAEMU guidelines, is being finalized and should 

enter into force for the 2019 budget at the latest. The budget programming process has also 

improved considerably since PEFA 2008, with an increased focus on short- and medium-term 

financial balances in conjunction with medium-term macro-economic and budgetary 

frameworks, debt sustainability analyses and cash flow plans. PEFA 2016 also noted an 

increased involvement of Parliament in the budget debate. 

2.3.3 In terms of budget execution and control, developments are also deemed positive, 

with noted improvement in revenue collection and the means used to ensure better tax base 

control, as well as enhanced taxpayer monitoring. Additionally, the national government 

procurement system has been assessed by the Bank as overall satisfactory, with a moderate 

level of risk. Similarly, financial control has been strengthened and is governed by general 

regulations that are aligned with good practices in terms of segregation of duties in public 

finance management. The national procurement system was assessed in accordance with 

accepted transparency and competition standards. 

 

 

 



6  

2.3.4 However, despite the above-mentioned progress, there are lingering weaknesses, 

although overall fiduciary risk has been assessed as moderate (see Technical Annex 1 on 

Fiduciary Risk Assessment). Accrual accounting is yet to enter into force, and still depends 

on the effective establishment of stock accounting. Similarly, the process of setting up the 

Single Treasury Account, initiated in 2013, has made no notable progress since the State’s 

accounts census stage. Through the Resource Mobilization and institutional capacity building 

support project (PAMOCI) project, the Bank is supporting the implementation of WAEMU 

directives and the Single Treasury Account. Furthermore, the adoption of the legal framework 

governing the financial regime of local and regional authorities has been delayed; the 

completion and publication of public procurement audits are not regular, and PIMA 2016 

reports that "public investment efficiency in Togo is low" with a gap of almost 70% against 

the most efficient countries, which would represent an efficiency loss of approximately 2/3 of 

the potential impact. These weaknesses have been taken into account in the design of the 

PAGPA. At the end of the last PEFA, PEMFAR and PIMA exercises conducted in 2016, the 

PA-RGFP was updated to take into account the findings and recommendations. The 

implementation of this plan should be accelerated, with a view to improving the overall 

performance of public finance management, in particular PI-11 "Investment Management." 

2.4 Inclusive Growth, Poverty and Social Context 

2.4.1 While the social indicators have improved slightly, Togo remains in the bottom 

quintile of the Human Development Index (HDI). The net enrollment ratio (NER) in primary 

education improved overall to 94.3% by 2015. The poverty incidence declined from 61.7% in 

2006 to 55.1% in 2015, but far short of the target of 27.6% expected in 2030 (SDG 1.2) and the 

extreme poverty rate has virtually remained unchanged , moving from 28.6% in 2006 to 28.7% 

in 2015. The Gini index improved from 0.393 to 0.380 between 2011 and 2015 (ODD 10), but 

growth is not yet pro-poor. Despite the progress of the last five years, spatial and gender 

inequalities persist. In rural areas, almost 7 out of 10 Togolese are poor and the availability of 

curative care decreased from 41% in 2014 to 37.7% in 2015, and more than a third of the 

population has to travel at least 5 km to a health centre. Only 50% of women are literate 

compared to 77% of men, and 25 women per 100 men own land, with their average areas 50% 

smaller than for men (CWIQ 2015). As a result, the Human Development Index 2016 remains 

low with a score of 0.487 ranking it 166th out of 188 countries. 

III. GOVERNMENT’S DEVELOPMENT AGENDA 

3.1 Governmental development strategy and medium-term reform priorities 

3.1.1 The Accelerated Growth and Employment Promotion Strategy (SCAPE) is the single 

reference framework for interventions under the Government's development agenda for the 

medium term. In 2013, GoT adopted SCAPE for 2013-2017; it is the reference framework for 

governmental action and comprises five strategic Pillars: (i) development of sectors with high 

growth potential; (ii) strengthening economic infrastructure; (iii) development of human 

capital, social protection and employment; (iv) strengthening governance and (v) promoting 

participatory development. The National Development Programme (PND 2018 - 2022), which 

is being prepared, will replace SCAPE. The transformation of the agriculture sector into a strong 

and inclusive growth sector is at the core of the Government's priorities. Furthermore, Togo is 



7  

working to strengthen financial management by continuing, in particular, with reforms fostering 

increased tax revenues, optimal management of public investments as well as public debt 

reduction.  The proposed PAGPA supports the implementation of these reforms through its 

Component (A), which aims to create a public and private investment framework conducive to 

agribusiness promotion; and component (B) which supports reforms aimed at increasing 

internal resources and improving their predictability in order to facilitate the capital expenditure 

necessary for the agriculture sector’s development. 

3.2  Obstacles to Implementing the National/Sector Development Agenda 

3.2.1  Togo has made remarkable progress which certainly places it on the road to lasting 

resilience. These gains must be consolidated in order to firmly lay the foundations of social 

peace and sustainable and equitable development. Progress is noted in the following areas: 

strengthening of security and stability, economic recovery with average growth rates of 5% 

over a ten-year period, implementation of major institutional and economic reforms, and 

strengthening of regional cooperation. However, the persistent ethnic and regional divide could 

constitute a setback to political stability, thus posing a severe threat to social peace and to exit 

from fragility. These challenges, if not addressed speedily, could impede economic progress. 

Moreover, the effective implementation of the SCAPE is severely constrained by inadequate 

financial resources. It is indeed clear from the last review of SCAPE, ahead of the development 

of the new NDP 2018-2022, that during the period 2013-2015 a total amount of merely CFAF 

516 billion, or 68%, was mobilized for the implementation of the scheduled priority action 

programmes against a requirement of CFAF 2.228 billion. Furthermore, the unsuitability of the 

business environment also constitutes a major obstacle to the emergence of a dynamic private 

sector, capable of driving the transformation of economic activity which remains unstructured 

and over 90% dominated by the informal sector.  

3.3 Consultation and Participation Process 

3.3.1  SCAPE 2013-2017 was developed in a participatory manner to ensure a 

comprehensive consideration of the different concerns of political and socio-economic 

stakeholders countrywide. SCAPE was prepared in consultation with all central and regional 

level stakeholders (central government, local authorities, civil society, private sector, political 

parties, traditional and religious leaders, etc.). Moreover, Togo's technical and financial partners 

were involved throughout the preparatory process.  

3.3.2 The design of the proposed PAGPA benefitted from broad consultations with key 

stakeholders. In particular, detailed discussions were held with the Permanent Secretariat for 

the Monitoring of Reform Policies and Financial Programmes (SP-PRPF) the Togolese 

Revenue Authority (OTR), the budget directorate and the Ministries of Agriculture, Commerce 

and Industry, Livestock, Rural Development, Environment and Gender. These discussions were 

followed by broader consultations with civil society (ONGs and producer associations). These 

exchanges led to agreement with the authorities on the need to involve the Togolese rural 

organizations and farmers’ associations in the framework for follow up and monitoring of 

implementation of the reforms.         



8  

IV. BANK SUPPORT FOR GOVERNMENT’S STRATEGY 

4.1 Linkages with Bank's Strategy 

The reforms under PAGPA support the implementation of the Bank's Togo CSP (2016-

2020). The programme’s first component supports reforms within the framework of Pillar (I) 

of the CSP, which aims at "Development of inclusive growth and agribusiness competitiveness 

poles”, and its second component largely contributes to the implementation of the Pillar (2) 

"Support for financial sector and local governance ". The proposed PAGPA, envisaged in the 

CSP, also contributes to the implementation of the Bank's 2013-2022 ten-year strategy and the 

Governance Action Plan (GAP II 2014-2018 ); more specifically, it contributes to three of the 

Bank's High Five strategic priorities: (i) "Feed Africa"; (ii) "Industrialize Africa" through 

measures to promote agro-industry and (iii) "Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa" 

by supporting reforms aimed at improving budget management and public action effectiveness 

through strengthening economic and financial governance and the key sector of agriculture. 

4.2  Compliance with Eligibility Criteria 

Togo fulfills the pre-requisites for budget support operations, as defined in the Bank's policy 

on reform programme support operations (see Technical Annex 3). However, efforts are still 

required in terms of coordination. The budget support consultation framework (COAB) is not 

optimal; there is no joint policy matrix of budget support interventions. Additionally, delays are 

noted in the implementation of a number of public finance reforms, translating into 

unsatisfactory results in the PEFA 2016 evaluation, where 28 out of 30 indicators are rated "C" 

or "D". Similarly, PIMA 2016 assessed the management of weak-efficiency investments. 

However, in view of the consistency of the measures of institutional reform being implemented 

and the level of integration of the national framework of the public finance management (see 

technical annex 1), global fiduciary risk has been rated moderate. In addition it should be 

minimized if the reforms planned in the PAGPA and others being finalised in the different 

departments concerned were diligently implemented. Furthermore, the Government is 

determined to accelerate the implementation of the national public finance reforms plan of 

PEFA, PEMFAR and PIMA, updated at the end of the 2016 fiscal year. 

4.3 Collaboration and Coordination with other Partners 

In designing the proposed programme, the Bank met with key technical and financial partners 

(TFPs) intervening through budget support, namely the IMF, WB, and EU. The AFD and 

UNDP also participated in the discussions. The operations in progress, or under preparation for 

the period 2017-2019, are: (i) the IMF's ECF of USD 241.5 million; (ii) the WB’s reform 

programme of USD 75 million and (iii) the EU’s budget support of EUR 54 million. Although 

thus far there is no joint intervention matrix, which awaits agreement with the government on 

its orientation, all partners, including the Bank, are strongly committed to harmonizing their 

actions in terms of dialogue and monitoring reforms. The areas of intervention of the TFPs are 

presented in Technical Annex No. 10.

4.4 Linkages with other Bank Operations 

4.4.1 Bank’s Active Portfolio in Togo: The active portfolio at April 2017 consists of ten 

operations for a total net commitment of UA117 

million (USD 160 million). It comprises eight 

national operations of UA 41.7 million (USD 57 

million) or 36% of the overall envelope. It also 

includes 64% for two multinational operations of UA 

75.3 million (USD 103 million). A high 75% of the 

portfolio is financed by grants. The sector 

distribution of the portfolio indicates the 

predominance of transport infrastructure with about 

64%, followed by economic and financial governance (17%), the social sector (16%), the water 

and sanitation sector (1%) and agriculture (1%). 

4.4.2  The March 2016 Portfolio Review assessed the portfolio performance as overall 

satisfactory, with a score of 3 out of 4 according to the rating of the latest Implementation Status 

and Results Report (ISRR). The portfolio’s performance is considered satisfactory with an 

overall disbursement rate of 42%, for an average age of 2.3 years. The portfolio is fairly young, 

with 50% of the projects approved between 2015 and 2016. The key challenges concern the 

mobilization of the national counterpart funds (particularly for transport projects) and the 

administrative red tape for disbursement and procurement. Special attention should be paid to 

the release of the national counterpart funds for the Togo-Burkina road rehabilitation and 

transport facilitation project, which is scheduled to close at end- 2017. The government will 

also take steps to accelerate the construction of the Togo-Benin juxtaposed checkpoint financed 

by the Lomé-Cotonou road rehabilitation project and transport facilitation on the Abidjan-

Lagos Corridor, Phase 1. 

4.4.3 Complementarity with Previous Operations: PAGPA is a continuation of the Bank's 

previous PARG-II budget support through the strengthening of public finance management and 

improvement of the business environment (see technical annex 7 on the achievements of 

PARGII). The implementation of the first component reforms will create the appropriate legal 

and institutional framework for the investment project under preparation by the department in 

charge of agriculture in the Bank, aimed at establishment of the Kara Agropole. The 

presentation this project to the Board is scheduled for December 2017. Furthermore, the second 

component reforms will benefit particularly from the capacity building activities under PAGFI 

(2016-2020), which is institutional support for the modernization of the OTR for optimized 

revenue collection. Additionally, the programme budget and the deconcentration of payment 

authorization and financial control will be further facilitated as the Integrated Public Finance 

Management System (SIGFIP) will be fully deployed and adapted to the new the new budget 

framework. The technical assistance and equipment needs for its deployment are fully covered 

by PAMOCI (2015-2018). Lastly, PAGPA is in complete synergy with the project to support 

markets reconstruction and traders in Kara and Lomé (2014-2018); the project to support youth 

employability and integration (2015-2020) and the project to support the financial inclusion of 

vulnerable women (PAIFFV 2016-2018).

4.4.4 Lessons Learned from Previous Operations:The completion reports for PARCI I and 

II, and PARG II, indicate the following lessons: (i) the match between the scope of the reform 

programmes and the implementation capabilities of the structures involved; and (ii) the need to 

underpin reform programmes with institutional support. These lessons are taken into account 

in the design of PAGPA. The programme focuses on a limited number of reforms, but is 

strategic and aligned with the national objectives of the SCAPE. Furthermore, the programme 

will be supported by capacity building projects (PAMOCI and PAGFI), and the monitoring and 

evaluation mechanism will involve civil society in periodic reviews.  

4.4.5 Analyses Underlying the Operation: Analyses conducted by GoT, the Bank and other 

technical and financial partners (TFPs) served as the basis for the preparation of the budget 

support programme. The foremost among them are: (i) Public Expenditure Management and 

Financial Accountability Review (2016 PIMA, PEFA and PEMFAR), at the end of which the 

PA-RGFP action plan was updated; (ii) the WB's 2018 Doing Business report; (iii) the IMF's 

Article IV consultations report in November 2016; and (iv) the report of the Dutch Consultancy 

Kadaster on the reform of the Directorate of State Land and Cadastral Affairs (DADC). The 

main recommendations of these studies concern (i) strengthening budget credibility and 

accelerating the fiscal transition, (ii) improving land management, and (iii) the need for 

economic transformation to drive strong and more inclusive growth. 

V. THE  ENVISAGED PROGRAMME  

5.1 Programme Goal and Objective  

5.1.1 The programme’s principal objective is to contribute towards creating conditions 

conducive to inclusive economic growth. Its specific objectives are to support the development 

of an investment climate conducive to agribusiness development in a context of improved 

internal resource mobilization capacity to support the required public investment. The 

programme addresses Togo’s major persistent challenges in terms of exiting fragility and 

reducing its vulnerability to social crises. Furthermore, the programme will extend the Bank's 

interventions to reforms geared towards gender mainstreaming in government actions, 

particularly in the agriculture sector. 

5.1.2 The programme comprises two components: A) Support for improved private 

investment environment and agribusiness promotion: this component supports implementing 

reform measures aimed at setting up efficient mechanisms and a business environment 

conducive to agribusiness development; (B) Support for enhanced internal resource 

mobilization and optimization of public investment management: This component aims to 

strengthen the mobilization of internal resources, and streamline the management of public 

investments, in order to offset the agricultural sector’s infrastructure deficit and attract more 

private investors to agribusiness. 

 



11  

5.2 Component A: Support for improved private investment environment and 

agribusiness promotion 

Sub-component A.1: Improving the private investment environment 

5.2.1 Context, Constraints & Challenges. The private sector’s contribution to the national 

economy remains relatively low. It contributes merely15% to GDP and remains dominated by 

the informal sector. The formal industrial private sector contributes only 4 to 6% to GDP, which 

is well below the country’s potential. The agricultural sector offers the greatest potential in 

terms of job and wealth creation. However, formal private sector investment is undermined by 

the constraints of this sector. The main constraints on private sector development, particularly 

in  agribusiness, include: (i) predominance of the informal sector; (ii) lack of competitiveness 

due to the high cost of inputs (water, energy, transport, the Internet, etc.); tax policy not aligned 

with private sector development, in particular the need to create more synergy between the 

Investment Code incentives and the Free Zone regime; (iii) insecurity of land tenure; (iv) a 

dispersed institutional framework based on a multitude of entities dedicated to the same 

investment promotion functions (Togo's Presidential Investment Council, Togo-Invest, 

Ministry of Trade, Ministry of Industry, Investment Promotion Agency and non-operational 

free zones, etc.); (v) limited capacity of management structures to support SME/SMI enterprises 

in developing business plans for access to markets and technology; (vi) mismatch between 

training and employment in relation to the actual needs of the Private Sector; and (vii) 

inadequacy of the regulatory framework for management of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) 

Contracts (the revision of framework and establishment of the PPP Unit is envisaged after the 

adoption of the pertinent UEMOA directives). 

5.2.2  Government’s Achievements & Strategies: In response to these constraints, the 

Government of Togo has adopted national and sector strategy papers focusing on the private 

sector as the prime mover of economic growth, jobs and wealth creation. The establishment of 

structures, such as the One-Stop Shop and the Presidential Council for Investment in Togo 

(CPIT), which is a framework for dialogue between the Government and the Private Sector at 

the highest level, has been beneficial. The CPIT helped identify the major constraints on the 

Togolese Private Sector’s attractiveness and competitiveness, and made recommendations that 

enabled the country to climb from 164th to 149th position, moving up 15 places in one year in 

the Doing Business 2015 ranking. But this ranking has deteriorated in successive reports by 

2016, 2017 and 2018 with respective ranks of 154th and 156ieme on 190 ranked economies. 

However, the country has made progress compared to the year 2016, notably in the following 

areas: Starting a business (+7 points); Getting electricity (+1 point); Trading across borders 

(+10 points); and Resolving insolvency (+3 points). Togo must not only consolidate the above 

gains by pursuing structural reforms, but also make efforts to improve its ranking in the 

following areas: lengthy timeframes for: (i) ownership transfer (283 days against an average of 

60 days in WAEMU) and (ii) obtaining a building permit (163 days against 156 days in the 

WAEMU), and the multiplicity of taxes paid per year (49 against an average of 39 in the 

WAEMU). Furthermore, the government has established DOSI. This structure, supported by 

the bank under PAMOCI, is aimed at supporting informal sector operators to gradually 

formalize their activities. The government has also supported the setting up of recognized 

management centres in line with the directive of UEMOA. In addition, the government is 



12  

committed, under the FMI programme and the World Bank operation under preparation, to 

implement structural measures to improve the competitiveness of the sectors of energy and 

telecommunications with a view to reducing production costs.    

5.2.3  Reforms envisaged: Creating a business environment conducive to private sector 

development in Togo requires removing the above constraints through administrative and 

institutional reforms. These include: (i) updating the Investment Code to attract foreign and 

domestic investment and strengthen it, with a view to employment creation under SCAPE; (ii) 

operationalizing the Investment and Free Zone Promotion Agency by appointing the Director 

General and his team; (iii) adopting a National Strategy; (iv) adoption of a new tax code aimed 

at simplifying the tax structure and procedures; and (v) the creation of a Business Climate Unit 

dedicated to strengthened monitoring and improvement of indicators of performance relating 

to the business environment. 

Sub-component A.2: Strengthening the legal and institutional framework for agribusiness 

development  

5.2.4 Context and Challenges: Since the 1960s, the State of Togo has demonstrated its 

willingness to promote the industrial sector, through the transformation of a substantial part of 

agricultural and mineral commodities successively through a State model based on imports 

substitution until the late 1980s and then through liberalization policies granting the private 

sector an increased role. Despite these efforts, it is clear that the industrial sector remains poorly 

developed and weakly integrated with the rest of the economy. Embryonic and sparse, Togo’s 

industrial fabric comprises around ten large companies, a hundred medium-sized industries and 

a relatively large number of very small industrial units. The industrial sector's contribution to 

GDP over the last three years averaged 17.8%, with an average growth of 1.3% per year. Togo 

has opted for the transformation of the agricultural sector as the basis for the structural 

transformation of its economy. Togo’s agricultural sector employs 60-70% of the working 

population and accounts for 38% of GDP. This sector has significant potential, with 3.4 million 

hectares of arable land, of which, only 45% are currently under cultivation with low yields of 

below 50% of the optimum level. It is characterized by a very low level of mechanization and 

professional expertise, with 89% of the cultivated land sown manually (hoes and machetes). To 

leverage this sector as an engine of economic growth and social inclusion, the country has 

formulated and adopted an agricultural policy (2015-2030) aimed at achieving "modern, 

sustainable and high value-added agriculture ". The promotion of agro-industry and Agropoles 

is pivotal in this policy, which will enable the creation of integrated development zones around 

agricultural activity in order to support the promotion of industrial and services clusters and 

stimulate growth. The Agropoles pilot programme covers three of the country’s five regions 

that have been selected on the basis of their comparative advantages, as well as inclusion and 

poverty reduction criteria. The priority target products are rice, soybean, cashew nuts and 

sesame, sorghum, millet, maize and livestock. The objective is to enhance food security through 

import-substitution and exporting surpluses in the regional markets of WAEMU and 

ECOWAS, given Togo's age-old trade tradition, the opportunities offered by its geographical 

position and the expected increase in regional demand due to population growth, urbanization, 

income growth and diet diversification. 



13  

5.2.5 Major constraints on the promotion of Agropoles and agro-industry in Togo are: (i) 

lack of industrial policy and lack of serviced industrial sites; (ii) weak integration of the 

industrial sector with other sectors of the economy in general and the agricultural sector in 

particular, due mainly to supply difficulties and the lack of organization of the sectors; (iii) 

inadequacy of quality infrastructure and production support that hamper the development of the 

industrial fabric and agribusiness in particular; (iii) weak competitiveness of industrial 

products, due notably to the high cost of production factors (energy, transport, communications, 

etc.), non-conformity of industrial products with international standards, unfair competition 

from some industrial products imported fraudulently, and absence of legal instruments and an 

institutional quality control system for consumer products marketing in Togo; (v) credit access 

difficulties, notably for the agricultural sector which represents on average 1-2% of the bank’s 

portfolio, due particularly to the poor organization and professionalization of agricultural value 

chains and land tenure insecurity, especially for women; (vi) weaknesses in the institutional 

framework for industrial support, due mainly to strategic, organizational and institutional 

weaknesses at the level of the Ministry of Industry and industrial support services3; (vii) lack 

of accredited laboratories and inspection bodies capable of carrying out physical/chemical and 

microbiological analyses of industrial and agro-industrial products, testing and calibration in 

metrology and certifications to international standards for local marketing and export; (viii) 

territorial imbalance between the maritime region, which hosts nearly all the industrial units, 

and the country’s other regions which are agriculture-oriented and under-industrialized due 

mainly to the lack of appropriate infrastructure.      

5.2.6 Government’s Achievements & Strategies: In response to these constraints, the 

Government of Togo has adopted a number of reforms with special focus on industrial 

development. These include the Framework Law of 12 August 2009 on the organization of the 

national harmonization scheme for standardization, accreditation, certification, metrology, 

environment and promotion of quality in Togo; Decree of 27 December 2013 issued pursuant 

to Law No. 2011-018 of 24 June 2011 on the status of the industrial free zone; Law of 20 

January 2012 on the Investment Code in the Togolese Republic; Decree of 27 December 2013 

issued pursuant to Law No. 2012-001 of 20 January 2012 on the Investment Code in the 

Togolese Republic; Decree of 27 December 2013 on the allocation, organization and operation 

of the National Agency for the Promotion of Investments and the Free Zone and the Accelerated 

Growth and Employment Promotion Strategy (SCAPE) 2013-2017, under which industrial 

development and the transformation of agriculture are major pillars. More recently in 2016, the 

Agricultural Policy, together with the Strategic Plan for the Transformation of Agriculture in 

Togo by 2030, was also adopted.  

5.2.7 Several measures have also been implemented with a view to facilitating access to 

financing, in particular the creation of the National Agency for the Promotion and Guarantee 

of Financing of SMEs and SMIs (ANPGF). Additionally, the WAEMU Directive on public 

procurement and the delegation of services was made internal in 2014. This instrument, which 

did not take into account partnership contracts, nevertheless provided for the development of a 

PPP strategy and the setting up of a PPP management unit. These two reforms are suspended 

                                                 
3  In particular the quality management infrastructure: Metrology-Standards-Quality Control (MSQC) 

 



14  

pending a new institutional framework by WAEMU, which more clearly separates delegation 

and partnership contracts, on the one hand, from public procurement, on the other. Lastly, the 

finalization of the National Industrialization Policy is underway and will be followed by an 

Industrialization Strategy, which will be prepared in collaboration with the Bank and UNIDO. 

To this end, the authorities sent a request for technical assistance to the Bank aimed at making 

Togo a pilot experiment for the implementation of the strategic pillar relating to the 

industrialization of Africa. 

5.2.8 Reforms envisaged: Accelerating industrial development in Togo requires 

implementing a number of reforms aimed at removing the above constraints, particularly 

through measures such as: (i) adoption of a National Industrialization Policy; (ii) 

operationalization of the High Authority for Quality and Technical Quality Structures (the Fund 

and the Agencies) through the appointment of the Director General and his team and the 

allocation of the necessary resources for its start up in the 2018 budget; (iii) the adoption of a 

National Agropoles Strategy; (iv) adoption of instruments governing the national Agropoles 

development structure; (v) adoption of a new Land Code governing the land registry which 

would foster agribusiness development and loan access. 

5.2.9 The main expected outcomes of Component A are: (i) improving the agricultural trade 

balance deficit, (ii) strengthening Togo's resilience to fragility factors related to spatial and 

gender inequalities; (iii) improving the competitiveness of the agricultural sector; (iv) securing 

land for the development of agribusiness and facilitating access to financing; and (v) improving 

the business environment for domestic and foreign private investment. 

5.2.10 Component B: Support for internal resources mobilization and optimal 

management of public investments: 

Sub-component B.1: Improved Revenue Mobilization 

5.2.11 Context Constraints and Challenges: Togo has committed, under the programme with 

the IMF, to substantially reducing the level of public debt by prohibiting any new external non-

concessional loan and by capping the volume of concessional commitments. Against this 

backdrop, and faced with the urgent need to pursue investment spending that is crucial to 

achieving the development objectives of SCAPE, maximizing internal resources mobilization 

in the short term is essential as the main factor for macroeconomic stability and the 

sustainability of the budget framework. The establishment of the OTR in 2014, coupled with 

the modernization and extension of the Lome Port Authority, has definitely helped to enhance 

Togo’s revenue mobilization capabilities. The ratio of tax revenues (cash basis) to GDP 

increased from 15.9% in 2013 to 17.9% in 2016 and could reach 19% in 2018, nearly the 20% 

WAEMU standard. However, recent economic developments in the sub-region have 

highlighted the great sensitivity of OTR's performance to customs duties; with OTR’s, results 

for 2016 falling below target for the first time. This underperformance, though minimal (-1.1%), 

is mainly due to the sluggish economic conditions in the country's key trading partners (Nigeria, 

Ghana). In this regard, the major challenge for the country is to optimize domestic taxation by 

broadening the tax base through the exploitation of the land niche in particular. Additionally, 

simplification of customs and tax procedures should be pursued to attract private investment 

and accelerate added value creation. 



15  

5.2.12 Government’s Achievements & Strategies: In response to the challenge of improving 

internal revenue mobilization, the Government, with the Bank's support, initiated structural 

reforms that culminated in the establishment in 2012 of the Togolese revenue authority (OTR), 

which incorporates the two State financial administrations (taxes and customs) into a single 

entity with administrative and financial management autonomy. The operationalization of the 

OTR has enabled Togo to increase its budgetary revenues substantially; they increased from 

CFAF 403.6 billion in 2013 to 568.5 billion in 2016, representing a 40.8% rise. The average 

growth rate of tax revenues over the period 2013-2016 is 12.7%. Furthermore, the country 

adopted a new Customs Code which entered into force in 2014 (Law No. 2014 - 003 of 28 April 

2014) replacing the old instrument dating from 1966. A new revision of the Customs Code is 

underway to, among other things, further clarify the division of powers and responsibilities 

between the OTR and the Ministry in charge of finance and fiscal policy. In addition, the draft 

text of the new Customs Code will take into account recent developments in international trade 

regarding trade facilitation and improved customs procedures. Similarly, the GoT initiated the 

revision of the tax code with a view to simplifying the tax system to make it more attractive to 

investors and also more accessible to tax administration and taxpayers. Lastly, the GoT in 2016 

committed to a feasibility study for the establishment of a tax registry for an optimized property 

tax base. 

5.2.13 Reforms Envisaged: To accelerate enhanced internal resources mobilization, PAGPA 

will support the adoption by the Council of Ministers of the: (i) Lomé Tax Registry Decree, (ii) 

new national Customs Code; (iii) decree establishing the fiscal policy unit by the MEF; and (iv) 

bill on the transfer of powers and resources to local and regional authorities. 

Sub-component B.2: Strengthening Public Investment Management 

5.2.14 Context, Constraints and Challenges: Investment management was assessed as very 

unsatisfactory by the PIMA, PEFA and PEMFAR exercises conducted in 2016. The PIMA 

report shows that "public investment efficiency in Togo is low" with a nearly 70% gap 

compared to the best performing countries. This represents a loss of approximately 2/3 of the 

effectiveness of the potential impact. The Public Investment Program (PIP) is not aligned with 

the budget. An absolute gap of 15% between the 2016 PIP component and the draft budget for 

2016 transmitted to Parliament was noted. Inadequacies have been identified at all levels of the 

process (multi-year programming, ex ante evaluation, project selection, public procurement 

performance monitoring, and availability of investment credits). PEMFAR4 noted the absence 

of "national guidelines defining the principles and conditions for the economic and financial 

evaluation of projects". Economic evaluations of cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness are not 

always conducted, and whenever this is done no review mechanism for results review by an 

independent structure of the contracting authority is in place. Additionally, project recurrent 

costs are poorly estimated and only the operating costs of a project as an administrative unit are 

included in the budget. This partly accounts for the shortcomings noted in the public 

investments monitoring with irregular implementation monitoring activities and incomplete or 

non-existent data bases on physical and financial implementation of investments. The 

investment management situation in Togo deteriorated further with the so-called "pre-

                                                 
4  PEMFAR 2017 Report 



16  

financing"5 practice that the GoT applied between 2011 and 2016. Under this mechanism, 

besides the shortcomings of the basic financial package, pre-financing agreements were 

concluded and executed outside the public expenditure circuit and to the total exclusion of the 

internal control and external audit bodies. State reimbursements to banks thus faced high risks 

of fictitious progress payment claims and/or poor quality work. Lastly, investment management 

and, in general, the implementation of public policies in Togo are also handicapped by the lack 

of programme budgets, weak results-based budgeting practices and the centralization of 

financial control. PEMFAR 2016 noted that "in Togo, the centralization of authorizing officer 

and financial controller functions are veritable sources of delays and inefficiency in the 

expenditure circuit". Indeed, having no local or regional delegations, all vote holders in local 

authorities must travel to Lomé to submit their commitment and validation files. 

5.2.15 Government’s Achievements & Strategies: As part of its IMF- backed programme, 

the government stopped the pre-financing practice in the latter half of 2016. The government 

also pledged not to undertake new pre-financed investments, to validate all existing pre-

financed investments and to include pre-financing debt in the outstanding public debt. The 

authorities have also decided to follow in future the budgetary and procurement procedures for 

all new public investments. Besides the effective abandonment of pre-financing, it is crucial to 

establish an efficient investment management system, systematize programme budgets and 

decentralize financial control speedily in order to ensure an optimal framework for future 

investments, notably those required for the implementation of the national Agropoles 

development strategy. 

5.2.16 Reforms envisaged: PAGPA will support (i) the development of a public investments 

planning, selection and programming manual; (ii) adoption of the ministerial order on the 

framework for regional monitoring of investment projects execution; (iii) finalization of the 

adaptation of SIGFIP to the technical requirements for the implementation of programme 

budgets; (iv) adoption by the Council of the Ministers of the decree on the deconcentration of 

financial control and powers, organization and functioning of financial control; (v) publication 

of the 2014 and 2015 public procurement audit reports; and (vi) the creation of Unit for 

government participation with a view to strengthening the monitoring of public investments 

and the management of state assets. 

5.2.17 The main results of Component B are: (i) sustained revenue growth, (ii) improved 

PIP implementation rate; (iii) improved local fiscal governance; and (iv) enhanced financial 

and technical capabilities of local and regional authorities. 

5.3   Policy Dialogue 

5.3.1 PAGPA will strengthen dialogue with the Government and consultation with other 

TFPs, mainly in the following areas: (i) internal resources mobilization, where discussions will 

focus on the need to broaden the tax base; and (ii) transformation of the Togolese economy with 

special focus on the conditions for effective implementation of the agricultural policy. In this 

regard, and relying on its country office, the Bank will continue support for improved land 

                                                 
5  PEMFAR 2017 Report: This mechanism consists in awarding a public contract to one or more contractors to carry out a public investment. 

Successful bidders are financed by commercial banks to perform the work with guarantees from the Togolese State. The State in its 

capacity as contracting authority reimburses the former as and when the works/services are performed, in principle after acceptance of 

progress payment claims submitted by the operators. 



17  

management in order to speed up the establishment of a reliable registry to secure land tenure, 

a prerequisite for attracting private investors. In addition, PAGPA will enable the Bank to raise 

the level of dialogue with Togo on issues of gender promotion and civil society’s participatory 

role. Lastly, ongoing discussions will be continued with the Togolese government towards 

operationalizing the joint framework for the monitoring and evaluation of the performance of 

budget support and reform program. 

5.4 Grant Conditions  
 

Table 2. PAGPA Preliminary Measures 

 

5.5 Application of Good Practice Principles on Conditionality 

In accordance with the 14 March 2012 Bank policy on budget support operations, the design of 

the proposed PAGPA applied good practice principles on conditionalities. Eight conditions 

precedent have been agreed with the Country and these are in line with the country's priorities. 

They are drawn from national reform documents, in this case the agricultural policy and PR-

GFP. The programme’s Pillars and the results-based logical framework were discussed, and 

agreed, with the Government and all stakeholders, including other TFPs and civil society. The 

disbursement schedule is aligned with the budget cycle. 

5.6 Financing Requirements and Terms 

The macroeconomic framework was updated as part of the supplementary budget approved by 

the Cabinet in November 2017 in order to take into account the commitments made under the 

IMF program which aims to reduce Togo's indebtedness risk. This revised budget 2017 projects 

a level of revenues (excluding grants) of CFAF 560.4 billion against expenditures of CFAF 

841.23 billion (including arrears payments). The resulting financing gap of CFAF 280.83 

billion is entirely covered by internal financing and external resources from technical and 

financial partners including the Bank.

5.7 Application of Bank Group Policy on Non-Concessional Debts Accumulation 

The proposed PAGPA is financed by a grant and thus not governed by the Bank Group Policy 

on non-concessional debt accumulation. 

 

VI. IMPLEMENTATION  

6.1 Programme Beneficiaries 

The direct beneficiary of the programme is the Ministry of economy and finance through 

the financing of the national budget. In an indirect way the program will benefit to the 

whole Togolese population. PAGPA will help lay the groundwork for a structural 

transformation of the local economy and regions around major Agropole projects, as a source 

of resilience to address fragility concerns in the rural areas (about 62% of Togolese population) 

and on the outskirts of Lomé and the regional capitals. In particular, the development of the 

Agropole in the Kara region should enable the creation of 2,500 jobs by 2020, of which 30% 

for women and 65% for youth, an electricity access rate of 43% (against 16% in 2015) and 55% 

access to drinking water (against 25% in 2015). 

6.2 Impact on Gender, the Poor and Vulnerable Groups 

Despite the progress made over the past five years, gender discrimination persists. In 2011, 

Togo adopted a National Policy on Gender Equity and Equality. In 2014, the Code of Persons 

and Family was also revised, thus enabling legislation on major discriminations that existed in 

marriage and inheritance. In particular, Article 99, which provided that "The man shall be the 

family head" has become "The family shall be run by the spouses". However, in the absence of 

a clear intervention strategy, exclusionary practices identified in the National Policy remain 

topical, including difficulty of access to farmland for women. In addition to the family code, 

PAGPA will support the adoption of the law on gender parity in elective and appointive 

positions, the effectiveness of which will do more to further raise the required awareness among 

opinion leaders. Moreover, the programme will support a study to explore equitable gender 

mainstreaming in tax policy without altering the impersonal nature of taxation. The 

recommendations of this study will form an integral part of the national gender strategy also 

supported by the programme. 



19  

6.3 Impact on the Environment and Climate Change  

PAGPA is classified as Category III in accordance with the Bank's environmental and 

social impact assessment procedures. PAGPA has no negative environmental impact. 

However, the country is faced with the adverse effects of climate change and environmental 

challenges, particularly in the agricultural, forestry, energy, mining and water resources sectors 

and in coastal zone management. The GoT demonstrates a strong commitment to providing 

lasting solutions to the environmental degradation problems and considering climate change in 

public policy. Since 29 December 1998, Togo has adopted its National Environment Policy in 

accordance with international environmental agreements (the Vienna Convention and the 

Montreal Protocol, the Rio Conventions and their respective Protocols, Rotterdam Convention, 

Stockholm Convention)6. Furthermore, SCAPE 2013-2017 lays special emphasis on the 

environment and community resilience to climate change, with the intensification of actions 

provided for under initiatives such as: (i) National Adaptation Plan (PANA); (ii) National 

Programme for Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD + 2010-

2050); (iii) National Action Plan for the Management of Marine and Coastal Environmental 

Resources; and (iv) Environmental Management Capacity Building Programme (PRCGE). 

6.4 Macroeconomic Impacts 

The proposed PAGPA will contribute to macroeconomic stability by improving the agricultural 

sector’s performance and reducing the trade deficit. Furthermore, according to a study by the 

Dutch firm Kadaster on the reform of State lands and Cadastral Affairs Directorate (DADC), 

the potential yield of property tax (Land Taxes on built-on estates, land ownership registration 

duties) at the national level, based on a computerized cadastre on only the 400 000 plots already 

identified, would be over CFAF 100 billion against CFAF 1.4 billion of revenue collected in 

2016. PAGPA would help generate the budgetary resources required to make impactful 

investments, notably those needed for the Agropoles, which represent sources of new business 

and employment opportunities. 

 

6.5 Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation 

The Programme’s executing agency is the Permanent Secretariat for the Monitoring of Reform 

Policies and Financial Programmes (SP-PRPF) within the Ministry of Economy and Finance. 

The implementation of PAGPA will be monitored through semi-annual and annual 

implementation reports, prepared by the SP-PRPF on the basis of a joint review with the 

programme’s participating structures as well as members of civil society, in particular the 

Coordination of Togolese farmer organizations and agricultural producers. The Togolese 

authorities will also transmit to the Bank the compliance report on the 2017 budget review law 

no later than 31 December 2018, drawn up by the Audit Court. The Bank will monitor the 

Programme in coordination with the group of TFPs acting through budgetary support. The Bank 

will undertake at least two programme supervision missions per year, and ensure that it interacts 

with all Programme stakeholders, including civil society.

20  

6.6 Financial Management and Disbursement 

 

6.6.1 Disbursement: The resources of the proposed operation comprise as follows:  

 An amount of UA 2.32 million (ADF) that will be disbursed in a single instalment in 2017, 

upon entry into force of the ADF Grant Agreement between the Republic of Togo and the 

African Development Fund and the fulfillment of the conditions precedent set out for the 

disbursement in section 7.2.3 below; and 

 An amount of UA 7.21 million, from the Transitional States Facility (TSF), that will be 

disbursed in a single instalment in 2017, upon entry into force of the TSF Grant Agreement 

between the Republic of Togo, African Development Fund and African Development Bank 

and the fulfillment of the conditions precedent set out for the disbursement in section 7.2.3 

below. 

 

6.6.2 Financial Management and Audit: The assessment of the fiduciary framework of the 

public finance management system shows moderate fiduciary risks (see technical annex 1). In 

accordance with the fiduciary strategy for the CSP 2016-2020 period, PAGPA will be entirely 

managed within the national public finance management system. The effective payment of 

budget support resources into the State budget will be monitored through the Audit Court’s 

General Compliance Report on fiscal 2017, which will be transmitted to the Bank and the 

National Assembly of Togo at the same time. In addition, the Audit Court will audit the 

financial flows of the Special Account opened in the name of the Treasury and intended for the 

deposit of the grant resources. This report must be sent to the Bank no later than 3 months after 

the disbursement. 

 

6.6.3 Goods and Services Procurement: The grant will be in the form of general budget 

support. Accordingly, its implementation does not directly entail any goods and services 

procurement issues. It is clear from the fiduciary risk assessment that the legal and institutional 

framework for public procurement in Togo is overall operational, and that public procurement 

is conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Public Procurement Code. However, some 

shortcomings are noted, particularly, the regular absence of: (i) annual audit reports; (ii) post-

auditing of contracts below the review threshold of the National Procurement Audit Department 

(DNCMP); and (iii) capacity constraints of the contracting authorities. The reform measures 

identified under the proposed PAGPA, and the political dialogue on the continued need to 

improve the procurement system, will help address these shortcomings. Furthermore, the 

revision of the public procurement code and its implementing instruments initiated since 2011 

is being finalized, and should lead to the adoption before end- 2017 of a new legislative and 

regulatory framework.

Project Summary 

 
1. Project Overview: 

1.1 The Agricultural Value Chain Development Programme (AVCP) – Project 1 is designed within 
the context of the National Development Plan II (NDP II) 2015/16-2019/20, which has been designated 

by Government of Uganda (GoU) as the second of a series of six 5-year NDPs to translate the country’s 

Vision 2040 into action. The NDP’s core objectives are to increase household income; generate 

employment; develop the infrastructure; increase access to quality social services; promote science and 

technology; and develop human capital taking gender equality as prerequisite for accelerating 

socioeconomic transformation which AVCP is consistent with. The Project’s activities, notably, 

construction of irrigation infrastructure, value chains development, and export promotion to enhance 

household incomes, are also consistent with the Government’s Agricultural Sector Strategic Plan 

(ASSP) 2015/16-2019/20, Gender Policy Brief for Uganda’s Agriculture Sector (2012), the Local 

Government Sector Strategic Plan (LGSSP) (2013-2023), and, the Uganda Climate Change Policy 2015.  

 

AVCP will be implemented along commodity value chain framework, with considerable attention to 

regulatory reforms. In agreement with Government, the project will focus on three commodity value 

chains, namely: Rice, Maize and Dairy/Beef value chains; and will comprise of three (3) operational 

and one (1) management components namely: i) Production and Productivity Enhancement, ii) 

Infrastructure Development, iii) Market Development and Trade Facilitation; and (iv) Project 

Management and Coordination. 

 
1.2 According to Uganda National Household Survey 2013, about 19.7%, of the total population 

representing 6.7 million people, are unable to meet their basic needs and are living below absolute 

poverty line. The incidence of poverty is highest among food-crop growing category in the rural areas 

due to low income. The project seeks to increase farmer incomes through improvements in Production 

and Productivity Enhancement, Infrastructure Development and Market Development and Trade 

Facilitation.  

 

1.3  The project will be implemented over a five-year period in various Districts across Uganda, 

according to the value chain selected, viz: Maize: Districts of Kyegegwa, Kamwenge, Masindi, 

Kiryandongo, Kasese, Buhweju, Mitooma, Nakaseke, Mukono, Luwero, Mityana, Kiboga, Buikwe, 

Wakiso, Buyende, Mayuge, Gulu, Oyam, Amolatar, Pader, Iganga, Kamuli, Mbale, Jinja, Kapchorwa; 

Rice: Locations where the Bank and Government have developed large irrigation schemes, Sironko-

Acomai irrigation scheme, and the districts of Bulambuli, Bukedea, Kamuli, Gulu, Oyam, Amolatar and 

Pader. The soft components including training, input delivery, extension service delivery and capacity 

building would be extended to all irrigation schemes undertaken with support of the Bank under FIEFOC 

1 & 2 (Nebbi, Oyam, Kween, Butaleja, Kasese, and Kitgum Districts); Dairy: This will mainly focus on 

the cattle corridor districts (from West to North corridors) with the livestock breeding centre in Mbarara 

district as the springboard. The target population in those districts is about 1,816,756 of which 51.7% 

are women and comprising 386,543.8 households. It is envisaged that the Project would lead to increase 

in yields of major crops by 50% and incomes of the target population specifically women by an average 

of 10%. In particular a greater percentage (50%) of the start-up enterprises and  income generating 

activities from natural resources, capacity building  and service delivery of the project would specifically 

target women and youth whose incomes are expected to increase by an average of 30%; thus enhancing 

their socio economic status through improved  yields and incomes. Moreover, the project is expected to 

provide technical skills in conservation and other farming practices through targeted training that 

promote environmental management and thus increasing agricultural productivity in the proposed 

project area. It will also assist in the formulation and implementation of measures that reduce 

deforestation and promote agro-forestry through introduction of economic trees which will lead to 

emission reductions and the protection of carbon reservoirs as part of the Reduction of Emissions from 



 

v 

 

Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) agenda. The carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestered as a result of 

tree planting by the project is estimated at 245, 000 tons of over 20 years. Training under the project 

will provide an opportunity for special attention to be given to intensification of climate-smart farming 

operations. 

 

2. Needs Assessment:  

2.1 AVCP has been identified as a flagship project under NDPII that will contribute to achievement 

of Uganda’s national objectives to increase household income; generate employment; develop the 

infrastructure; and increase access to quality social services. This Appraisal Report is in response to a 

request from the Government of Uganda to provide assistance for the transformation of agriculture in 

Uganda from subsistence to a more commercially oriented one. The Bank had initially fielded a Country 

Dialogue, Identification and Preparation Missions to Uganda in March, July and September, 2016 

respectively.  The missions were to understand the extent of implementation of the ASSP and the general 

context of agriculture in the country with a view to designing a support package from the Bank to achieve 

the goal of agricultural transformation; and supporting processing and marketing activities in this sector. 

The feasibility study and preliminary designs of the Achomai irrigation scheme in Bukedia/Bulambuli 

Districts was developed by JICA. In the course of the development of this project, the project team also 

held several consultation meetings with various stakeholders of the project; including civil society and 

development partners. 

 

2.2 Hence the project is demand driven by farmers, local governments, various stakeholders and the 

GoU to address requirements of increased agricultural production and enhancement of household 

incomes.  The project will build on Uganda’s relatively strong record in improving gender equity 

through deliberate inclusion and promotion of project activities with farms and agribusiness activities 

owned, operated, and managed by women. The project will aim to empower more women and youth to 

make decisions, invest in agriculture, and improve their social and economic status for the family’s 

overall wellbeing. 

 

2.3 In keeping with the Bank’s new strategy on addressing fragility and building resilience, the project 

has also been developed with the goal of building resilience in mind. Food security is critical to 

community resilience, and agribusiness provides value addition, creating agro-industries, and export 

promotion.  By helping the development of agribusiness and cottage industries, the Bank will contribute 

to more stable sources of income, greater food security, boosts youth employment, and expand economic 

opportunities for the communities. 

 

3. Bank’s Added Value: 

3.1 The proposed project is anchored on the Country Strategy for Uganda (2017-2021) which is 

articulated around two strategic pillars, namely: (i) Infrastructure development for value addition and 

industrialization, and (ii) Skills and Capacity Development for poverty reduction. This is in line with 

the Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy (2013-2022) and the High Five (h5s) Initiatives which prioritizes 

agriculture and food security as one of the key areas for the Bank’s future assistance. The Bank has 

considerable experience in implementing agriculture and infrastructure projects in Uganda, including 

the Area-based Agricultural Modernization Programme (AAMP), the Northwest Smallholder 

Agricultural Development Project (NSADP),  the Community Agricultural Infrastructure Improvement 

Programme – Project 1, 2 and 3 (CAIIP-1, 2, 3) - that won the 2013 USA Department of the Treasury 

MDB Awards, the Market and Agriculture Trade Improvement Project, and Farm Income Enhancement 

and Forestry Conservation Project (FIEFOC). The proposed project draws extensively from lessons 

learned from the Completion Reports and Impact Studies of the completed Projects. The most pertinent 

lessons include (i) the enhancement of agricultural commodity trade, including establishment of linkages 

between Bank financed projects; (ii) integration of the value addition activities involving the private 

sector; iii) Adopting integrated watershed development and alternative livelihood; and iv) Building the 



 

vi 

 

capacity of Water Users’ Associations (WUAs)  to ensure maintenance of the infrastructure and project 

sustainability. These lessons have been taken into consideration in the design of this project 

 

4. Knowledge Management:  

4.1 Knowledge gained from implementation of the above projects, particularly on the need to build 

country capacity for project implementation, has been duly applied in designing this project. In the same 

pattern, the knowledge that will be generated by the project will be instrumental in designing and 

managing similar Bank-financed projects in the future. Provisions made for knowledge and information 

management include on web-based technology for natural resources data collection, ICT platform to 

network value chain actors, compilation and presentation, the market Information System (MIS) that 

will generate data pertaining to prices, sources and volumes of commodities to be shared with all 

stakeholders and the gender sensitive value chain analysis and development that allow women and youth 

to design and manage sustainable SMEs.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OFMANAGEMENT TO THE BOARD 

OF DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED ADF LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF 

UGANDA FOR THE AGRICULTURAL VALUE CHAIN DEVELOPMENT 

PROGRAMME (AVCP) 
 

Management hereby submits this Report and Recommendation for an ADF loan of UA 57 million, 

under ADF terms to finance the Agricultural Value Chain Development Programme activities in 

Uganda.   

I. STRATEGIC THRUST & RATIONALE 

1.1. Project linkages with country strategy and objectives 

1.1.1 The Agricultural Value Chain Development Programme (AVCP) – Project 1 is designed 

within the context of the National Development Plan II (NDP II) 2015/16-2019/20, which has been 

designated by Government of Uganda (GoU) as the second of a series of six 5-year NDPs to translate 

the country’s Vision 2040 into action. The NDP’s core objectives are to increase household income; 

generate employment; develop the infrastructure; increase access to quality social services; promote 

science and technology; and develop human capital taking gender equality as prerequisite for 

accelerating socioeconomic transformation which AVCP is consistent with. The Project’s activities, 

notably, construction of irrigation infrastructure, value chains development, and export promotion to 

enhance household incomes, are also consistent with the Government’s Agricultural Sector Strategic 

Plan (ASSP) 2015/16-2019/2020, Gender Policy Brief for Uganda’s Agriculture Sector (2012), the 

Local Government Sector Strategic Plan (LGSSP) and, the Uganda Climate Change Policy 2015.  

 

1.1.2 AVCP has been identified as a flagship project under NDPII that will contribute to 
achievement of Uganda’s national objectives to increase household income; generate employment; 

develop the infrastructure; and increase access to quality social services. This Appraisal Report is in 

response to a request from the Government of Uganda, to provide assistance for the transformation 

of agriculture in Uganda from subsistence to a more commercially oriented one. The Bank had 

initially fielded a Country Dialogue, Identification and Preparation Missions to Uganda in March, 

July and September, 2016 respectively. The missions were to understand the extent of 

implementation of the Agriculture Sector Strategic Plan (ASSP) and the general context of 

agriculture in the country with a view to designing a support package from the Bank to assist the 

Government in achieving the goal of agricultural transformation; and supporting the development of 

financing arrangements that can support commercial production, value addition and marketing 

activities in this sector. 

 

1.1.3 The Project’s key outputs, notably, development of irrigation infrastructure, promotion and 

development of agribusiness, and trade facilitation to enhance household incomes are consistent with 

the country’s ASSP which operationalizes agricultural priority investments programme under the 

NDPII.  The ASSP prioritizes investment in water for production, value addition and value chains 

development, and, promotes investment in sustainable natural resource use. The Project is also 

consistent with the National Agriculture Policy (2013) of the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal 

Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF), and the Irrigation Master Plan of the Ministry of Water and 

Environment (MoWE). Further, the project activities are also in line with the Gender Policy Brief for 

Uganda’s Agriculture Sector (2012), the Uganda Forestry Policy, the Uganda Climate Change Policy 

and Uganda’s Ministry of Gender’s revised Gender Policy 2007.  

 

1.1.4 The sector and the project area face varying degrees of fragility. Food insecurity, lack of rural 

infrastructure, lack of economic opportunities for women and youth etc. are key elements of fragility. 

The project is designed to address these challenges and build resilient institutions and societies.   



 

2 

 

 

1.1.5 Regionally, the project is consistent with Pillar 2 of the NEPAD’s Comprehensive African 

Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP), which focuses on improvement of agricultural 

infrastructure and related capacities for enhanced food security; and with the Sustainable 

Development Goals. 

 

1.1.6 The Project was programmed to be financed under the ADF 14 window and the new CSP for 

Uganda (2017-2021). The Government of Uganda is committed to operationalizing its National 

Development Plan (NDP) but remains with the challenges of fully financing all activities using the 

limited budgetary resources available. 

1.2. Rationale for Bank’s involvement 

1.2.1 The proposed project is anchored on the Country Strategy for Uganda (2017-2021) which is 

articulated around two strategic pillars, namely: (i) Infrastructure development for value addition and 

industrialization, and (ii) Skills and Capacity Development for poverty reduction. This is in line with 

the Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy (2013-2022) and the High Five (h5s) Initiatives which prioritizes 

agriculture and food security as one of the key areas for the Bank’s future assistance. The Bank has 

considerable experience in implementing agriculture and infrastructure projects in Uganda, including 

the Area-based Agricultural Modernization Programme (AAMP), the Northwest Smallholder 

Agricultural Development Project (NSADP), the Community Agricultural Infrastructure 

Improvement Programme – Project 1, 2 and 3 (CAIIP-1, 2, 3) - that won the 2013 USA Department 

of the Treasury MDB Awards the Market and Agriculture Trade Improvement Project, and Farm 

Income Enhancement and Forestry Conservation Project (FIEFOC). The proposed project draws 

extensively from lessons learned from the Completion Reports and Impact Studies of completed 

Projects and from other small scale irrigation, natural resources, watershed management, and 

community driven development projects in Uganda and other countries. The most pertinent lessons 

include (i) the enhancement of agricultural commodity trade, including establishment of linkages 

between Bank financed projects ; (ii) integration of the value addition activities involving the private 

sector; iii) Adopting integrated watershed development and alternative livelihood; and iv) Building 

the capacity of Water Users’ Associations (WUAs)  to ensure maintenance of the infrastructure and 

project sustainability. These lessons have been taken into consideration in the design of this project. 

 

1.2.2. With effects of climate change and the increasingly unreliable rainfall pattern, the need for 

investment in irrigation has become of paramount importance. Only about 5% of the irrigation 

potential of Uganda has been exploited so far and the GoU requested the Bank to support its renewed 

efforts to expand its irrigation investments. The GoU has developed an Irrigation Master Plan for the 

period 2010-2035 which targets to expand irrigation infrastructure to cover at least 70% of surface 

water irrigation potential by 2035. This will increase the total agricultural land under irrigation from 

the current 14,418ha to about 420,000ha by 2035. As a result, the GoU has ranked irrigation as the 

third most important infrastructural investment that will facilitate economic transformation of the 

country as envisaged under Vision 2040. 

1.2.3 The Project is in line with the Bank’s Ten Year Strategy (TYS) as it relates to inclusive growth 
and food security through the involvement of youth and women in skills development and 

entrepreneurship. Further, the Project is consistent with Bank’s High 5s for transforming Africa and 

the recently approved Bank Strategy for Agricultural Transformation in Africa 2016-2025. The 

Project is also consistent with the Bank’s CSP (2017-2021) which aligns with the High 5s mainly in 

agricultural and industrial development. Bank interventions under this pillar will focus on the 

following three critical infrastructure sub-sectors: (i) Transport infrastructure to foster trade and 

market integration; (ii) Agricultural infrastructure to promote transformation of the agriculture sector 

in respect of improved production and productivity, value addition, and trade; (iii) Water and 

Sanitation to widen access to water and sanitation services, improve livelihoods as well as boost 



 

3 

 

value-adding and manufacturing activities, especially in small underserved towns all of which are 

well aligned to the NDPII. This Project is identified by the new CSP as one of the key investment 

projects to be supported by the Bank under its pillar mentioned above. In addition, the Project is 

aligned with the Bank's Gender Strategy (2014-2018) by enhancing the regulatory framework to 

create enabling environment for women’s participation in the agriculture sector and supporting 

women’s economic empowerment along the agriculture value chains.  

1.2.4 The Bank Group is financing a number of on-going agriculture sector projects in Uganda. The 

Bank has gained good experiences under FIEFOC-1 in implementation of irrigated agriculture and 

has also accumulated vast experience through the implementation of other agricultural infrastructure 

projects. The first phase of FIEFOC has rehabilitated three irrigation schemes Mubuku, Doho, and 

Agoro irrigation scheme with a total area of about 3000ha now benefiting more than 6,800 farm 

families. It has also supported communities and households to work together to manage watersheds, 

enabled households to participate in tree planting and beekeeping activities. The Second FIEFOC 

project approved by the Board in January 2016 will further increase the coverage of irrigable area in 

Uganda and also increase productivity for rice and maize whose value chains will be developed under 

this proposed project. Further, the Bank has experience in primary value addition activities under the 

completed and ongoing CAIIP projects.  

With interventions indicated above and the bottom-up approach that Bank projects are being 

implemented there are clear indication that in these areas poverty rates have dropped significantly, 

from 31.1% in 2006 to 19.7% in 2013, to which the Banks’ projects contributed in this reduction. 

During implementation of AVCP, linkage and synergies with these agricultural infrastructure 

projects and others will be ensured to avoid duplication and maximize synergies among projects 

implemented by the Bank.

1.3.1 The Bank is one of the major Development Partners (DPs) in Uganda, providing about 21.5% 

of development assistance in the agriculture and rural development sector. The Bank collaborates 

closely with the other Development Partners, especially the World Bank, IFAD, USAID, JICA, and 

the European Commission for agricultural related projects, within the framework of the Agriculture 

and Rural Development Donor Coordination Group. The Group has been greatly invigorated through 

the Bank’s field presence. In an effort to harmonize Development Partner intervention, the Bank has 

partnered with the other DPs under the umbrella of the Agricultural Sector Development Partners 

Group (ASDPG) to undertake development interventions in the choice of sub-sectors and activities 

where it has a comparative advantage. In regard to this Project, the Bank will work closely with JICA 

who are preparing an irrigation programme, but in particular to tap on their experiences with farmer 

groups development in irrigation activities; the IDA and USAID who are engaged in activities that 

promote agricultural input distribution  using advanced ICT methodologies that link the farmer to 

input dealers; the Netherlands Embassy on crop intensification and marketing; the EU on market 

oriented beef meet subsector development; etc.   

 

1.3.2 The ASDPG is currently chaired by the JICA. The Group is well informed about the project 

through consultations with Bank Teams at preparation/appraisal missions and also continually by 

Uganda Country Office (COUG) through monthly meetings. The Uganda Country Office is an active 

member of this group, which relates with the overall Heads of Missions’ Local Development Partners 

Group (LDPG), currently chaired and coordinated by the World Bank. 
 

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

Project development goal:  The overall goal of the Project is to contribute to poverty reduction and 

economic growth in Uganda through enhanced productivity and commercialization of agriculture.  

 

Specific Project objective: The project objective is to improve household incomes, food security, and 

climate resilience through commercial agricultural practices, sustainable natural resources 

management and agricultural enterprise development.  

 

Project Implementation Modality: (i) The project will be implemented using a Business Service 

Provider, ICT based platform, which will be procured competitively. This model has been tried and 

tested by the Feed the Future project of the United States Agency for International Development 

(USAID).  The model will be replicated and expanded to reach our target Districts in Uganda. The 

platform has already demonstrated a private sector-led input distribution and extension ICT platform, 

that is integrated with the buyers and has successfully delivered to 301,000 farmers certified seeds,

2.2. Technical solutions retained and other alternatives explored 

Table 2.2: project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection  

Alternative  Brief description Reasons for rejection 

Alternative 1 Invest in rain water 

harvesting infrastructure such 

as small water holding 

structures scattered all over 

the selected districts for 

agriculture, livestock and 

domestic use 

Rain water harvesting structures cannot sustain 

the impacts of climate change and their socio-

economic impact will be spread out thinly. In 

addition, it cannot provide food and cash crops 

two to three times a year.  

Alternative 2 Invest in pumped irrigation 

development by lifting water 

mechanically to higher 

ground for crop production 

Pumped irrigation schemes were dropped on 

account of the complex nature of their operation 

and maintenance, costs are high and the capacity 

to maintain at small farm level does not exist. 

Further it contributes to carbon emission.  

Alternative 3 Introduce spate irrigation 

system  

Not sustainable due to variability of rainfall; 

non-efficiency and drudgery. 

Alternative 4 Using government 

institutions to drive the 

extension service and input 

delivery 

Government will do better supervising a 

Business Service Provider recruited to play this 

role based on realities on the ground 

2.3. Project type 

AVCP is a public sector investment project that builds on successful Bank’s investments in Uganda. 

It is designed in the form of a stand-alone Investment Project with the main aim of scaling up 

production and productivity in rice, maize and dairy/beef value chain development, agribusiness 

development, risk sharing facility and capacity building activities funded by ADF 14 Loan resources. 

2.4. Project Cost and financing arrangements  

2.4.1 Project Costs: The total cost of the project is estimated at UA 64.41 Million, net of taxes, 

comprising UA 18.59 million or 34% in local costs and UA 45.82 million or 66% of the total cost in 

foreign cost. This cost is inclusive of physical and price contingencies estimated at 9%.  All project 

costs are exclusive of taxes, and therefore Government should provide budget allocation for VAT in 

each quarter of the financial year in addition to the 12% Government contribution. A summary of 

project cost estimates by components, expenditure categories, and schedule are presented in Tables 

2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 below, while details are provided in the Technical Annexes B2 Volume II of the 

appraisal report.

2.4.3 Counterpart Funds: The Government of Uganda counterpart contribution to the project will be 

12% of the total project cost (equivalent to USD 10.0 million); in addition to 18% VAT contribution 

on all works, goods and services. 

2.5. Project’s target area and population  

2.5.1 The project will be implemented over a five-year period in various District across Uganda, 

according to the value chain selected, viz: Maize: Locations where the Bank has developed irrigation 

schemes, and the Districts of Kyegegwa, Kamwenge, Masindi, Kiryandongo, Kasese, Buhweju, 

Mitooma, Nakaseke, Mukono, Luwero, Mityana, Kiboga, Buikwe, Wakiso, Buyende, Mayuge, Gulu, 

Oyam, Amolatar, Pader, Iganga, Kamuli, Mbale, Jinja, Kapchorwa; Rice: Sironko-Acomai irrigation 

scheme, and the districts of Bulambuli, Bukedea, Kamuli, Gulu, Oyam, Amolatar and Pader. The soft 

components including training, input delivery, extension service delivery and capacity building 

would be extended to all irrigation schemes of the Bank in FIEFOC 1 & 2 (Nebbi, Oyam, Kween, 

Butaleja, Kasese, and Kitgum Districts); Dairy: This will mainly focus on the cattle corridor districts 

(from West to North corridors) with the livestock breeding centre in Mbarara district as the 

springboard.  

 

2.5.2 The population in those districts is about 14,227,201 of which 50.1% are women and 

comprising 3,078,673 households. It is envisaged that the Project would lead to increase in yields of 

major crops by 50% and incomes of the target population specifically women by an average of 10%. 

In particular a greater percentage (50%) of the start-up enterprises and  income generating activities 

from natural resources, capacity building and service delivery of the project would specifically target 

women and youth whose incomes are expected to increase by an average of 30%; thus enhancing 

their socio economic status through improved standard of living. The project will benefit further 

300,000 households of which 20% are female headed outside of irrigation command areas, by 

introducing or improving soil conservation measures in the catchments feeding the irrigation 

schemes. Moreover, the project is expected to provide technical skills in conservation and other 

farming practices that promote environmental management and thus increasing agricultural 

productivity in the proposed project area. 

 

2.6 Participatory Process/Public Consultations: Key stakeholders in the AVCP Project include; 

Government, NGOs; Civil Society,; Farmer cooperatives including women and youth groups; Private 

sector companies; All these stakeholders were consulted in the project design,  etc. Furthermore, a 

stakeholder workshop was organized on September, 2016 which was attended by more than 45 

representatives of stakeholder organizations from national to community levels. During the sessions 

the participants provided valuable input to inform the shaping of the AVCP. A wide range of issues 

were noted for follow-up including among others: access to inputs and microfinance, market 

linkages, mechanization and post-harvest handling, the need for inclusion of value addition to the 



 

10 

 

produce, operations and maintenance of irrigation facilities, strong farmers’ capacity development 

programme, establishment of demonstration centers, consideration to multi-purpose use of water, use 

of existing government structures and the need to complement community initiatives. Stakeholder 

consultation activities will continue during project implementation to ensure their maximum 

participation and ownership of Project activities.    

2.7. Bank Group experience, lessons reflected in project design 

2.7.1 The Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) highlighted some lessons, including: (i) 

role played by project implementation unit in expediting project execution after delay in start-up 

when implementation was entrusted to  Ministries; (ii) lack of project designs and drawings at project 

start-up results in implementation delay; (iii) inadequate consultation with stakeholders in selection 

of sites results in poor utilization of funds and lack of ownership; (iv) weak M&E system results in 

poor project monitoring; and (v) lack of irrigation scheme management entities compromises 

sustainability. Based on said lessons, (i) AVCP will have a PIU due to inadequate technical staff 

within MAAIF, (ii) participatory M&E system will be established in PY1 which will be linked to 

MAAIF M&E system, and (iii) detail designs of the irrigation schemes will be made available before 

the end of 2017 whilst the supervision consulting firm will be brought on board in PY1 through 

advance procurement arrangement to offset the time spent in the parliamentary approval process. 

2.7.2 The Bank Group is financing a number of on-going agriculture sector projects in Uganda. The 

Bank has gained good experiences under AAMP, CAIIP 1, 2 and 3; MATIP 1 and 2, FIEFOC-1 and 

2 in project implementation and in irrigated agriculture and has also accumulated vast experience 

through the implementation of other agricultural infrastructure projects. The first phase of FIEFOC 

has rehabilitated three irrigation schemes Mubuku, Doho, and Agoro irrigation scheme with a total 

area of about 3000ha now benefiting more than 6,800 farm families. The Schemes have supported 

communities and households to work together to manage watersheds, enabled households to 

participate in tree planting and beekeeping activities. The Second FIEFOC project approved by the 

Board in January 2016 will further increase the coverage of irrigable area in Uganda and also increase 

productivity for rice and maize whose value chains will developed under this proposed project. 

Further, the Bank has experience in primary value addition activities under the completed and 

ongoing CAIIP and MATIP projects.  

2.7.3 With interventions indicated above and the bottom-up approach that Bank projects are being 

implemented there are clear indication that in these areas poverty rates have dropped significantly. 

During implementation of AVCP, linkage and synergies with these agricultural infrastructure 

projects and others will be ensured to avoid duplication and maximize the benefits and gainful 

employment. 

2.8. Key performance indicators   

2.8.1 The Results Based Logical Framework contains indicators pertaining to the impact, outcomes 

and outputs of the project.  It includes the Bank’s Core Sector Indicators (CSI) and other institutional 

indicators that will be used to gauge the effectiveness of project management. Monitoring and 

evaluation of the project activities and results based logical framework indicators will be conducted 

by the Monitoring and Evaluation Expert of the National Project Coordination Unit (NPCU), in close 

collaboration with all the partners involved. Special emphasis will be on disaggregation of data to 

capture benefits from the project to gender and the youth. Baseline data will be collected at the 

beginning of project implementation in addition to the baseline information collected during the 

feasibility study to improve measurement of indictors of the project. An experienced M&E expert 

will be put in place from the start of the project. 

 



 

11 

 

2.8.2 The impact and outcome indicators include: (i) income level among farmers, (ii) reduction in 

people living below poverty line, (iii) increase in yield of selected commodity value chains, and (iv) 

number of livelihood activities and businesses developed,  

 

Key output indicators are: (i) area developed under irrigation; (ii) number of farmers adopting 

conservation farming practices and land area protected against erosion; (iii) involvement of women 

and youth in decision-making bodies; (iv) volume of maize, rice and dairy/beef products traded.  

 

2.8.3  Baseline data: Baseline data was collected as part of the socio-economic study and used in 

the RBLF. The baseline data will be further strengthened and gaps filled including collection of 

gender disaggregated data in PY1. Indicators will be used to compare project performance against 

the baseline situations. Various supervision missions and periodic progress reports will reflect the 

level of achievement under each of these indicators. 
 

III. PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1.    Economic and financial performance  

3.1.1 The main economic benefits of the project are increase in rice and maize procutivity and 

production, improvement in livestock parameters , increase in beneficiary incomes and strengthening 

of food security and climate resilience. Other project benefits include jobs generated by business 

developed, reduction in sediment load of rivers resulting from degraded forest rehabilitation and soil 

conservation measures and, improved balance trade of agricultural products as the country exports 

more and import less rice. At farm level, the project will reach out to at least 450,000 maize growers, 

205,000 rice farmers and more than 2 million herders. The project is expected to anually generate an 

additional production of 450,000 MT of maize and 328,000 MT of rice. Support to the development 

of value addition will enhance export of rice and maize milled products. On the average, it is 

estimated that about 200 000 MT of maize and 200 000 MT of rice will be exported annually. 

 

3.1.2 The economic and financial analysis was based on the incremental net benefit arising from the 

project investment. The main assumption underlying the economic and financial analysis is an 

anticipated increase in the productivity of the main crops (maize and rice) and livestock as a result 

of the development of irrigation, increased improved seeds and fertilizer use, and capacity building. 

It is estimated that the production of the basic crops will increase by 50% on the average and 20% 

for the livestock parameters.  The production costs including milling processing costs are derived 

from the results of the similar projects implemented in the country and computed field data from 

Uganda. Prevailing 2016 market prices are used for input and output valuation. Infrastructure 

operating and maintenance costs are estimated at 15% of investment costs. Prevailing 2016 market 

prices were used for input and output valuation. Because no government interventions in terms of 

input subsidies or import restrictions are recorded and, no duty or taxes are leveraged on all 

agricultural inputs, such as fertilizers, semen and agro-chemicals, the market prices are used as the 

shadow prices for tradable goods used in domestic rice and maize production. For economic analysis, 

maize and rice market prices are adjusted to reflect their economic values.  

3.1.3 The FIRR is 20% with a NPV of US$ 2.127 million at a capital opportunity cost of 12%. The 

EIRR is 23% for a NPV of USD 3, 2 million at a capital opportunity cost of 12%. The summary 

result is tabulated below: 

FIRR, NPV (base case) 20%, NPV (12%): US$ 2.127 million 

EIRR, NPV (base case) 23%, NPV (12%): US$ 3.2 million 

 

3.1.4 The economic rate of return (EIRR) and the internal rate of return (FIRR) are sensitive to 

changes in prices and costs. A 10% increase in the prices of agricultural products generates an EIRR 



 

12 

 

of 25% and a FIRR of 22%. Similarly, a 10% increase in production costs decreases the EIRR and 

the FIRR to 21% and 19% respectively. Details of financial and economic analyses are shown in in 

Appendix VI. 

 3.2.   Environmental and Social impacts  

3.2.1 Environment: The project is classified as Environment Category 2 according to the Bank’s 

Environmental and Social Assessment Procedures (ESAP), which implies that the potential negative 

environmental and social impacts are not major and can be mitigated with the application of measures 

specified in ESMFs. An ESMF, with a budgetary allocation of USD 500,000, was prepared and its 

Summary posted on Bank’s on 21st March 2017  to provide guidelines for the management of 

potential environmental and social aspects at all possible project sites.  

 

3.2.2 AVCP will have significant positive environmental impacts including (i) contribution to the 

restoration of forest cover that will lead to reduced soil erosion, flooding, and water pollution. The 

carbon dioxide (CO2) removed from the atmosphere is estimated at 245, 000 tons over 20 years as a 

result of tree planting by the project as shown in the details under Technical Annex C.3.1 (b) of the 

Technical Annex; (ii) restoration and enhancement of the ecosystems through re-vegetation and tree 

planting activities planned as part of the project - this  will have significant impacts on combating 

deforestation and desertification as well as mitigating the impacts of climate change; (iii) 

rehabilitation of degraded watersheds to sustain and enhance water catchment ; and (iv) improved 

farm productivity, soil fertility management and increased uptake of proper crop husbandry practices 

that will improve agricultural production and marketing, thus contributing to food security and 

improved farm incomes.  

 

3.2.3 Most of the negative impacts to the environment will be attributed to construction activities 

with minimal operation and post operation effects. Some of these impacts will pertain to (i) loss of 

vegetation due to land clearing for irrigation schemes and farm/forest roads construction that can be 

minimized by refilling of burrow pits and re-vegetation, (ii) increase in water abstraction arising from 

small-scale irrigation schemes requirement, that  could upset the existing flow patterns of the rivers, 

but will be minimized through established water management systems and environmental flow 

requirements to allow sufficient water for downstream users, and (iii) soil erosion due to loose top soil.  

 

3.2.4 Climate Change: Climate change models for Uganda suggest a projected increase in 
temperature of 0.7o C to 1.5o C by 2020. These models also predict a likely increase in the variability 

of rainfall with most areas projected to experience higher rainfall. Uganda is already experiencing 

extreme weather events including droughts, floods and landslides.  Floods and landslides have been 

linked to drained wetlands, deforestation, and compacted soil that no longer have any water-retention 

capacity. The Uganda Vision 2040- the long term development blue print for the country-recognizes 

the impacts of climate change on all sectors of Uganda’s economy, and has committed to the need 

for preparedness through adaptation and mitigation strategies to ensure the resilience of the country 

to climate change impacts. The Bank categorized the project as Category 2 in terms of Climate Risk, 

requiring the application of the Climate Adaptation Review and Evaluation Procedures (AREP).  The 

project carried out Climate Screening Score (CSS) as shown in Appendix VII. The project design 

reflects the projected climate change risks in Uganda and has embedded adaption measures based on 

the Bank’s AREP and aligned with the country’s National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) 

priority projects including community tree planting, land degradation and water for production 

projects.  

 

3.2.5 The AVCP programme is by design part of a strategic response to the impact of climate change 

evidenced by environmental degradation, dry spells and floods in the vulnerable districts of Uganda. 

The planned interventions of AVCP project will help reduce impacts of extreme weather events 

through the development of irrigation systems and promotion of alternative livelihoods that will help 



 

13 

 

smoothen the cyclical impacts of droughts and ensure all-year income generating activities. 

Specifically, the catchment management activities under component 1 of the project will facilitate 

the reduction of land degradation and related flood impacts; thus increasing the resilience of the 

community. The irrigation infrastructure will also be designed to be climate resilient in order to 

prolong the life span of the infrastructures. The project’s ESMP further elaborates the challenges 

posed by climate risks on the project outcomes as well as proposed adaptation and mitigation 

measures.  

 

3.2.6 Involuntary resettlement: The proposed new irrigation structures will be located on 

Governments owned land and communally owned land tenure systems. It is anticipated that all 

Project activities will not lead to land acquisition as project activities will be carried out on land that 

already belongs to the Government or the beneficiary groups, therefore no land disputes are 

anticipated. Extensive consultations on access were held with beneficiary groups, district officers, 

and other government counterparts including the Uganda National Environmental Management 

Agency. There is a strong commitment from all stakeholders and  Government will provide the Bank 

with a Letter of Comfort stating that the land where the project infrastructure is to be constructed are 

free of encumbrances and belongs to the communities and/or government agencies who have 

consented to project activities.  

  

3.2.7 Green Growth: AVCP has been designed in accordance with the Green Growth principle of 

“quality and inclusiveness of growth”. The Program design is flexible enough to address existing and 

emerging development challenges (equitable rural development, youth unemployment, equitable 

access to food, water and clean environment) without locking resources into activities that may 

deplete the country’s natural resource capital. AVCP has been designed in a holistic manner that has 

integrated economic, social and environmental concerns for overall improvement of the well-being 

of the communities.  

 

3.2.8 Gender and Social: In 2014, 19.79 million females accounted for 51.5% of the total population, 
while an estimated 31% of rural households were female headed. The significance of women’s role 

in community is underscored by the fact that females are normally charged with the responsibility of 

food production at household level. The low access to water for production, especially in rural areas, 

undermines agricultural productivity. While the GoU has made substantial efforts in adopting gender-
related laws and with the amendment of the Land Act (2010), and the launch of Uganda National land 

Policy (2015), significant progress has been registered in increasing female land ownership, from a low 

16% in 2010 to 39% in 2012. Despite this,   issues of limited ownership, access to land owing to cultural 

barriers and lack of access to credit continue to affect women’s agricultural production. Other 

hindrances include, lack of extension service, inadequate access to information technology and poor 

linkages to markets, post-harvest loses, and degradation of the environment which mostly affects 

women. Consequently, AVCP has been designed to address gaps in sustainable agricultural water 

management and low agricultural productivity. The project will support a minimum of 30% 

representation of women in the leadership role in water user associations, and emphasize 50% of the 

target group training on agribusiness skills in crop value chain preferred by women and youth.  The 

project will support a minimum of 30% women, and 30% youth employment in the labour intensive 

infrastructure development activities on the scheme. 

 

3.2.9 The project will support gender capacity building activities for AVCP as detailed in Annex B8 

of the Technical Annex. Furthermore, the project will adopt a gender sensitive approach to support 

implementation, to ensure capacity is built for effective gender responsiveness in all project 

components. As such, gender mainstreaming guidelines will be developed in project Y1 to prepare 

women to participate in different community committees dealing with financing (Tier 4 Microfinance 

institutions), agriculture and natural resources. The project will also promote strong institutional 

involvement of women as beneficiaries in farmer cooperatives group trainings, specifically with 



 

14 

 

regards to extension service in agronomic practices, access of financial resources, post-harvest 

handling, collective commodity bulking and marketing and the establishment to sustainable market 

linkages. A Social Development Specialist/Gender expert will be assigned from MAAIF to focus on 

implementation of these activities. The gender mainstreaming in this project is estimated at UGX 

548,900,000 for capacity building as shown in the Technical Annex page B8.9 (ii). 

 

3.2.10 Youth unemployment:  The challenges facing the youth include limited job opportunities, 

inadequate employable skills and skills mis-match, limited access to productive assets, and early 

marriages hence forcing the youth into informal agricultural practices. According to the Uganda 

statistical abstract 2014, the overall national unemployment rate increased to 9.4% (2012/13) from 

3.6% (2009/2010) and 1.9% in 2005/06. Similarly youth unemployment remains high at 78% 

(NDPII). Majority (79%) of the youth live in rural areas engaging in agriculture. The AVCP project 

will ensure the participation of youth on the irrigation scheme management and engage youth farmer 

groups in agribusiness skills trainings, value chain activities especially in income generating projects 

such as Apiary and fish farming. At least 10% youth will be employed in any labour intensive 

agricultural activities on the irrigation schemes by providing targeted training programme. The 

Empowering Novel Agri-Business-Led Employment for Youth in Uganda’s Agriculture (ENABLE 

Youth Uganda) Program being piloted in Uganda by the African Development Bank (AfDB) under 

FIEFOC.2 Project. 

 

3.2.11 HIV/AIDS: The project does not envisage the creation of farm worker camps. Notwithstanding 

this, the Project will support selected activities aimed at reduction of HIV/AIDS new infection 

especially among women and youth who present a higher rates of infection (8.3% women, 6.1% men 

and youth 3.7%). The National HIV prevalence increased from 6.4% in 2004 to 7.3% in 2011 among 

15-49 year olds (Uganda Aids Indicator Survey). The core activities to be supported include 

awareness creation on HIV/Aids among farmer and agribusiness groups to enhance their protection 

from HIV/Aids infections and also improve the living conditions of those who are already persons 

Living with Aids. The schemes will designate an HIV-AIDS coordinator from farmer groups and 

collaborate with the existing national programmes to publicize the HIV/AIDs activities in the 

schemes. The project will collaborate with such organizations like the Uganda AIDS commission; 

and with local NGOs at the project levels (for execution purposes). It is mandatory that contractors 

to have an active HIV and AIDS workplace policy (with activities for (Staff) internal awareness 

raising, prevention, tackling issues like stigma and discrimination, treatment, focal point etc.). At 

implementation level, the partners will be mandated to enhance capacity of beneficiaries to address 

issues like awareness raising, prevention, treatment; the design should include community categories 

like the youth, farmers, mothers etc., incorporate HIV and AIDS module in the proposed 

entrepreneurial training, strengthen beneficiary referral systems with the already established 

structures like hospitals (for prevention and treatment purposes); strengthen/ create community 

support structures like e.g. treatment groups etc. 

 

3.2.12 Addressing fragility and building resilience: The project will help build resilience in target 

communities by addressing the issues of food security and increasing economic opportunities through 

agribusiness. 
 

IV. IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1. Implementation arrangements 

4.1.1 Executing and Implementing Agencies:  The Project’s Executing Agency will be the Ministry 

of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) who will be responsible for the overall 

implementation and management of the Project. The Ministry of Water and Environment will be 

responsible for implementation of the watershed management related activities (in conjunction with 

relevant MAAIF departments) and also provide technical backup in the development and 



 

15 

 

implementation of irrigation related infrastructure. Further, MAAIF will coordinate implementation 

of activities being undertaken by other institutions, namely, the Uganda National Bureau of Standards 

(UNBS)/Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives (MTIC); Uganda Seed Trade Association 

(USTA), Farmer Cooperatives and Associations; National Agricultural Research Organisation 

(NARO); Diary Development Authority (DDA); the National Animal Genetic Resources Centre and 

Data Bank (NAGRIC&DB); and, the Private Sector Foundation of Uganda (PSFU) and its related 

agribusiness associations.  

 

4.1.2 A National Project Coordination Unit (NPCU) will be established to assist MAAIF in 

coordinating implementation of Project activities between the respective implementing agencies. 

MAAIF will designate a National Project Coordinator who will be the overall Project Manager.  In 

addition, to the National Project Coordinator, a Senior Procurement Officer with engineering 

background, a Senior Financial Management Officer, a Senior Monitoring and Evaluation Officer, a 

Senior Value Chains Development Officer, and a Senior Engineer will be recruited competitively as 

core staff of the NPCU. The NPCU will also draw from the technical staff in the Ministries and 

agencies involved in the implementation of Project activities to complement its work. Each Ministry 

or Agency will assign a technical staff who will lead implementation of activities in such an 

institution and will be a member of the Project’s Technical Committee to be chaired by the National 

Project Coordinator. The technical committee will ensure a collaborated implementation of project 

activities and provide technical support. A multi-sectoral Steering Committee will be established to 

provide policy oversight of the project, approve work plans and budgets, and ensure adherence to 

relevant strategies established by Government during project implementation. The Steering 

Committee will be chaired by the Permanent Secretary, MAAIF and will comprise Permanent 

Secretaries of MoWE, MoTIC, MoFPED, and technical heads of the three agencies responsible for 

implementation of Project activities (i.e. Diary Development Authority, Uganda National Bureau of 

Standards, and the National Animal Genetics and Resources Data Bank. Other members will be 

selected from relevant private sector organizations, research institutions, and beneficiary 

organizations. The Steering Committee will meet at least twice every year.  

 

4.1.3 Furthermore, the National Project Coordination Unit will be an integral part of the Executing 

Agency under the direction and supervision the Permanent Secretary, MAAIF. The National Project 

Coordinator will report directly to the Permanent Secretary, MAAIF. The NPCU will ensure that 

Project activities are initiated and are adequately budgeted for, consolidate project records, submit 

all procurement documents to the Bank for review and approval; compile and submit all disbursement 

applications and quarterly progress reports; coordinate annual audits of all Project accounts and 

facilitate submission of audit reports to the Bank. Each District will designate a Project Support 

Officer (PSO) among its staff, who will head the District Technical Support Team as detailed in the 

Technical Annex (B3.3) to support the implementation and technical supervision of the Project, 

including sensitization of farmers, training, and monitoring and evaluation in the respective local 

governments. The PSO will also coordinate the relevant stakeholders involved in the implementation 

of the project in the district.  

 

Procurement Arrangements 

 

4.1.4: “Procurement of goods (including non-consultancy services), works and the acquisition of 

consulting services, financed by the Bank for the project, will be carried out in accordance with the 

“Procurement Policy for Bank Group Funded Operations”, dated October 2015 and following the 

provisions stated in the Financing Agreement. Specifically, Procurement would be carried out 

following: 

Borrower Procurement System ( BPS): Specific Procurement Methods and Procedures (PMPs) 

under BPS comprising Public Procurement Disposal of Public Assets Act and Regulations, using the 



 

16 

 

national Standard Solicitation Documents (SSDs) for various group of transactions to be entailed 

under the project. Considerations shall be made to promote Government efforts on local content.  

Bank Procurement Methods and Procedures (BPP): Bank standard PMPs, using the relevant Bank 

Standard or Model Solicitation Documents SDs, for contracts that are either: (i) above the thresholds, 

or (ii) in case BPS is not relied upon for any category of procurement;  

Procurement Risks and Capacity Development: the assessment of procurement risks at the 

Country, Sector, and Project levels and of procurement capacity at the Executing Agency (EA),   were 

undertaken for the project and the output have informed the decisions on the procurement regimes 

(BPS and Bank)   being used for specific transactions or groups of similar transactions under the 

project. The appropriate mitigation measures and costs have been included in the procurement 

capacity development action plan (CDAP) under the project. 

 

4.1.5 MAAIF has a Procurement and Disposal Unit (PDU) that is responsible for procurement of 

goods, works and services with technical support from the directorates. The PDU is headed by a 

Principal Procurement Officer and has a total of four procurement officers as well as four contract 

staff. A Contracts Committee that approves all procurement activities is in place and functional. The 

ministry has experience in managing procurements of Bank financed projects. The resources, 

capacity, expertise and experience of MAAIF are adequate to carry out the procurement activities 

financed under this project. However, in view of the work load, the capacity of the PDU will be 

further strengthened by the recruitment of a senior procurement specialist, who will fast track the 

procurement processes on the project (see appendix VI). A delegated contracts committee will also 

be established to facilitate the Project’s procurement processes.   

 

Financial Management Arrangements 
 

4.1.6 The project will make use of the country’s PFM systems and the Assistant Commissioner, 

Accounts of the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries (MAIIF) will be 

responsible for the Financial Management (FM) of the project. With the Permanent Secretary MAIIF 

being the Accounting Officer. 

 

The Ministry’s Finance and Administration department led by a Principal Accountant who has 

appointed accountants to manage the day to day financial operations of all donor funded projects 

guided by the Government of Uganda (GoU) financial regulations and procedures and the PFM Act 

2015.  The project will use a manual accounting system for the funds received from the Bank with 

the GoU’s counterpart funding managed through the Integrated Financial Management Information 

System (IFMIS). All project’s financial transactions will be captured and reported based on the 

International public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). The Finance Department of the Ministry 

has sixteen accountants who will assist the NPCU in normal Ministry financial documentation 

approvals. 

 

4.1.7 Budgeting for the project will follow the GoU rules and procedures on budgeting. The total 

project budget will be included in the ministry’s annual budget and included in the GoU’s National 

budget. The project will follow the GoU financial year of 1st July to 30th June and its financial 

statements which will be prepared within three months of the end of the financial year, will be audited 

by the Office of the Auditor General or his appointee. The audit terms of reference will be agreed 

between GoU and the Bank by negotiations. The audit report, complete with a Management Letter 

and responses, will be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of the financial year. The 

Ministry will also be required to submit quarterly Financial Reports together with the Projects 

Progress report to the Bank no later than 45 days after the end of each quarter. The format of the 

quarterly reporting will be agreed by negotiations. 

 



 

17 

 

The Government procedures regarding internal controls in place and also applied for the existing 

projects should be used by the new project. The following internal control procedures among others 

are in place: Approval of bank accounts opening, proper authorization and approval of bank 

reconciliations, segregation of duties in payments and cash management, monthly bank 

reconciliations and timely banking of receipts. To provide oversight and assist in strengthening the 

project internal control mechanism, the Ministry’s internal audit section will include the project in 

its annual audit planning and the project’s audit reports will be shared with the Bank as needed.  

 

The results of the assessment indicate that the Financial Management overall risk rating is Moderate 

after mitigating measures. In conclusion, the proposed financial management arrangements put in 

place meet the Bank’s minimum requirements for project financial management and therefore 

adequate to provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and timely information on the status of the 

project required by the Bank. 

 

Disbursement Arrangements 

4.1.8. The Bank’s special account and direct payment disbursement methods will be available to the 

project as prescribed in the bank’s Disbursement Handbook. All Project expenditures incurred by the 

Ministry will be paid by the PIU either from the special account or using the direct payment method.  

All activities being done by other non-governmental entities will be paid for using the direct payment 

method with documents processing done by the PIU. 

The project will open one foreign currency special account into which the proceeds of the loan will 

be deposited. A project account in UGX will also be opened. The accounts will be opened at the Bank 

of Uganda and their opening will be a condition precedent to first disbursement of the loan. An initial 

disbursement will be deposited in the project Special Account (SA) in foreign currency based on a 

six-month work program and an estimated budget of activities drawn from the agreed work plan 

approved by the Bank.  The SA will be replenished through submission of Withdrawal Applications 

when the project meets the replenishment conditions as stipulated in the Disbursement Letter and 

Handbook. The direct payment method will be used for payments of contracts for equipment, supplies 

and services (including audit-where applicable and consultancy). The Bank’s Disbursement Letter 

will be issued stipulating key disbursement procedures and requirements. To ensure adherence to 

agreed financial regulations, the special account will be monitored by AfDB supervision missions. 

4.2. Monitoring  

4.2.1 Monitoring will be an integral part of project management activities. The M&E Specialist at 

the NPCU will be responsible for the overall monitoring and evaluation of Project activities.  In using 

the performance indicators and targets specified in the Results Based Logical Framework (RBLF), 

project implementers tracking progress towards project results are expected to take special note of 

changes that reflect advancement towards the translation of outputs into development outcomes. In 

developing monitoring and planning indicators, they will be disaggregated along gender lines. A 

gender sensitive baseline study will be undertaken in PY1 which will be followed up with annual 

gender sensitive surveys to assess performance and impact of project activities.

4.3. Governance  

4.3.1 International assessments show that Uganda has progressed its accountability and transparency 

ratings and indicators of Governance including corruption control, rule of law, regulatory quality and 

Government effectiveness. The 2014 Ibrahim Index of African Governance (IIAG) ranked Uganda 

19th out of 52 African countries. The 2013 IIAG provided Uganda’s performance across four 

categories of governance namely (a) Safety & Rule of Law (25 out of 52), (b) National Security (74.5 

out of 100), (c) Gender (6th out of 52), and (d) Human Development (19th out of 52). Uganda’s 

average score was 56.1 out of 100 which was higher than the continental average of 51.5. The 2012 

World Bank Institute’s Worldwide Governance Indicators rated Uganda as follows (0=low and 

1=high): (a) voice and accountability = 0.31; (b) political stability and absence of violence = 0.20; 

(c) Government effectiveness = 0.33; (d) regulatory quality = 0.45; (e) rule of law = 0.44; and (f) 

control of corruption = 0.14. The proposed measures in terms of project implementation include: (i) 

provision of financial management manual to guide Project staff; (ii) utilization of internal audit to 

identify pre-audit transaction challenges; and (iii) regular submission of progress reports.  

4.4. Sustainability   

4.4.1 The participatory approach adopted during the project design and envisioned to be extended 

during the implementation phase will enhance the ownership of project’s activities and realizations 

by the main stakeholders ensuring its sustainability. The irrigation infrastructure will be operated and 

maintained by the Water Users Associations (WUA) whose capacities will be developed through 

training. The project will ensure that at least 30% of women and youth are represented in the irrigation 

management committees. Operation and Maintenance guidelines will be developed including tariff 

setting by the supervising consultant for the operation and maintenance of the schemes that takes into 

consideration past experiences in the management of irrigation schemes in the country. The WUAs 

are expected to cover the O&M costs from the contribution of farmers through water charges. The 

management of support infrastructures such as storage and essential O&M equipment could be 

outsourced to business service provider on agreed terms under the overall supervision of the WUA.  

 

4.4.2 Capacity Building: Lack of qualified engineers and farmers’ experience in irrigation 

development has been identified as a serious constraint in implementation of the project. The project 

will develop a proposal to train farmers, extension agents, relevant government technicians and 

agribusiness actors including in the use of the pilot demonstration site to enhance the capabilities of 

the operation and maintenance of the irrigation schemes. Further, the project through MAAIF will 

endeavor to partner with JICA, IsDB, WB, The Netherlands Embassy, DFID and others who have 

interest in the area of farmers’ capacity development to ensure sustainability of the irrigation scheme.  

4.5. Risk management:  

4.5.1 The first risk is related to the effect that the private sector may not be willing to take advantage 

of the opportunities in developing the value chains. Provision of Business Development Support 

Services to potential SMEs actors will motivate them to participate in the project  
 

4.5.2 The second risk is associated with difficulties of managing the infrastructure that the project 

will develop. The use of Business Service Provider (BDS) with requisite experience will do this 

before handing them over to farmer groups.  

4.5.3 The third risk is that the beneficiaries may not attain the required level of Operation and 

Maintenance of the infrastructures. However, this will be mitigated by developing an Operations and 

Maintenance Manual for infrastructure facilities, which the farmers also participated in identifying.  



 

19 

 

 

4.5.4. The fifth risk would be delayed fulfillment of loan conditions. However, COUG will work and 

follow up closely with the Government  

4.6. Knowledge building 

4.6.1 A number of studies/surveys are planned to be undertaken through the project, with a view to 

generating information that will inform both the farmers, the local governments, Ministries as well 

as other stakeholders in the course of decision making. The analytical work will focus on beef value 

chain study, study on the potentials for agro-poles and Farmers’ Cooperative Formation modalities. 

All knowledge attributes and lessons generated from the project will be shared with the respective 

Government and District authorities, the Bank, development partner agencies and civic society.
