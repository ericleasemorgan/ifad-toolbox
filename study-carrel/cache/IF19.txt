Recommendation for approval 

The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed 

financing to the Republic of the Niger for the Family Farming Development 

Programme in the Diffa Region (ProDAF-Diffa), as contained in paragraph 59. 

Proposed loan and Debt Sustainability Framework Grant 
to the Republic of the Niger for the Family Farming 
Development Programme in the Diffa Region  

I. Strategic context and rationale 

A. Country and rural development and poverty context 

1. Poverty and security situation. With a poverty rate of 48.9 per cent, a gross 

national product of US$430 per capita and a very low human development index 

(HDI) of 0.348 in 2015 and 2016, Niger is one of the poorest countries in the 

world, ranking 187
th
 out of 188 countries on the HDI. Attacks by Boko Haram 

terrorists around Lake Chad have exacerbated the poverty of the area’s population, 

whose security is seriously affected. According to government statistics, there were 

252,305 refugees or displaced persons in the Diffa region in October 2017. 

2. Agricultural potential. The Diffa region has real potential for the production of 

irrigated and flood recession crops, having an arable area of 265,000 hectares, 

69 per cent of it in the Lake Chad lakebed, 28 per cent along the Komadougou 

Yobé River et 3 per cent in the oasis basins of Mainé-Soroa and Goudoumaria. 

Rainfed crop development in the agriculture subsector is limited due to low rainfall, 

coupled with low dune-soil fertility and parasite pressure. The main constraints to 

irrigated crop production are the limited financial capacity of farmers to embrace 

irrigated farming, the absence of credit tailored to their needs and the lack of 

effective systems to provide them with inputs and market their produce. 

3. In terms of livestock production, in 2016 the livestock population in the Diffa 

region (all species) was estimated at over 3,750,000 head, corresponding to 

1,637,000 tropical livestock units, or 9.9 per cent of the nation’s stock. Some 

95 per cent of the population engages in livestock production, which accounts for 

55 per cent of the region’s annual gross product, making it the leading activity in 

terms of total export earnings from agro-sylvo-pastoral products. Notwithstanding, 

the livestock subsector in the Diffa region suffers from chronic forage shortages 

(in 10 out of 12 years), poor networking of water points, hindering rational use of 

grazing lands, and poor farmer organization in terms of marketing the animals and 

their subproducts. 

4. Market access. Market transactions in the Diffa region are dominated by the sale 

of livestock and peppers and controlled by Nigerians, who are positioned 

downstream in the value chains as the main buyers but upstream as well, in the 

case of peppers, as the main providers of inputs through crop loans. This model, 

however, has been seriously disrupted by the Boko Haram attacks, which have 

caused most rural markets to shut down and led to the development of informal 

channels of trade. A large portion of the profit margin, therefore, accrues to 

merchants and their intermediaries, while farmers sell around 70 per cent of their 

production at harvest, when prices are at their lowest.  

5. Situation of women and young adults. Limited access to production factors, 

among them land, financing and technical and economic advisory services, exclude 

women from agricultural production activities, leaving them to work in the artisanal 

processing of farm products (small-scale food services, oil, dairy products and flour 



EB 2018/LOT/P.15 

2 

and by-products). In rainfed crop production, women’s participation is observed in 

cowpea harvesting, and in irrigated crop production, in pepper harvesting. In 

recent years, women have shown a keen interest in irrigated market garden crops 

in oasis basins. The banning of motorcycle use due to security issues has seriously 

affected the employment of young men who once provided motorized transport for 

people and merchandize. Agriculture, especially market gardening, could offer 

them an opportunity to re-enter the workforce. 

B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and 
RB-COSOP  

6. The Diffa Regional Development Plan (2016-2020) emphasizes: (i) the 

preservation, growth and diversification of agro-sylvo-pastoral and fish production; 

and (ii) the strengthening of community resilience to climate change, crises and 

natural disasters.  

7. The national policy orientations for 2020
1
 include the goal of tripling the 

contribution of irrigated crops to the national grain balance sheet. This strategic 

orientation also applies to the Diffa region, thanks to a greater supply of production 

factors (water-capture works, drainage systems), technical and economic 

agricultural advisory services and the creation of warehousing and processing 

facilities and mechanisms for securing market access for the products supplied by 

the agro-sylvo-pastoral and fish value chains. 

8. The Nigerien authorities’ determination and efforts to fight rural poverty by 

targeting support to young adults and women through agricultural development as 

the primary source of rural employment, strengthening the population’s resilience 

through upstream and downstream production assistance and helping households 

hurt by the security crisis to rapidly recover are the motives behind the preparation 

of this programme.  

9. Concerning refugee populations, the Government is committed to establishing 

mechanisms to support local communities, accommodating displaced persons 

through the development of sustainable agropastoral activities and ensuring the 

social and economic integration of displaced persons in the receiving areas and 

preparing them to return to their country and village of origin once the security 

threats are under control. This vision is supported by the findings of partners 

operating in the area, who state that after years of humanitarian assistance, the 

target groups’ current needs are related more to the demand for economic projects 

that empower them and guarantee their dignity. This demand is consistent with 

IFAD’s intervention framework, grounded in the promotion of family farming to 

eradicate poverty and hunger in rural areas.  

10. Thus, based on the conclusions and measures agreed upon by Niger and IFAD in 

the COSOP 2013-2018 midterm review, the Government has requested IFAD’s 

agreement to finance and extend the Family Farming Development Programme 

(ProDAF) to the Diffa region to capitalize on the achievements of previous and 

current projects in this region. 

II. Programme description 

A. Programme area and target group 

11. The programme will operate in oasis basins, the western and central areas of the 

Komadougou Yobé river valley, the central agropastoral area and the north-

western pastoral area of the region. This area covers the entire communes of 

Goudoumaria, Mainé-Soroa, Chétimari, Diffa, Gueskérou, Foulatariet and N’Guel 

Beyli and the southern part of the N’gourti commune, connecting the Gueskérou 

                                           
1
 (i) The Sustainable Development and Inclusive Growth Strategy 2035 (SDDCI – Niger 2035); (ii) the Economic and 

Social Development Plan 2017-2021; (iii) the Action Plan 2016-2020 of the 3N Initiative "Nigeriens Nourishing Nigeriens"; 
and (iv) the Small-scale Irrigation Strategy in Niger. 



EB 2018/LOT/P.15

and N’Guel Beyli communes. Operations will be concentrated around five economic 

development poles (EDP): Goudoumaria (including Boudti), Mainé-Soroa, N'Guel 

Beyli/Foulatari, Chétimari and Diffa (including Gueskérou). The N'Guel Beyli EDP 

will focus on agropastoral activities and products, and the other EDPs on activities 

and the products of irrigated and rainfed agriculture and sedentary livestock 

production. 

12. Four criteria were used in selecting the intervention areas: (i) security conditions 

(subject to variation); (ii) the geographical concentration of activities in an EDP 

approach; (iii) potential partnerships and synergies with other actors; and (iv) the 

presence of different types of target groups, addressed through a holistic approach. 

13. The targeting of beneficiaries will take place at two levels: (i) socio-economic 

targeting of vulnerable local or refugee households; and (ii) demographic targeting 

of women and young adults. More particularly, ProDAF-Diffa will target 20,000 

households, or roughly 140,000 people, representing some 16 per cent of the 

population in the Diffa region, 30 per cent of them refugees. Furthermore, at least 

30 per cent of the beneficiaries will be women and 30 per cent young adults, as 

stipulated in the ProDAF strategy for equitable development and empowerment of 

women and youth.  

B. Programme development objective 

14. The programme’s general objective is adapted from the objective of the ProDAF 

programme in the Maradi, Tahoua and Zinder regions, of which this programme is 

an extension. Its purpose is to sustainably ensure food and nutrition security and 

the resilience capacities of rural households in the Diffa region. 

15. The development objective is to sustainably increase the income, adaptation to 

climate change and market access of family farms and promote the social and 

economic integration of refugee or displaced populations into the receiving 

communities. 

16. ProDAF-Diffa operations will be part of the following key actions in the five selected 

EDPs: (i) the development of a wholesale market; (ii) small-scale irrigated farming 

in intermediate areas located near national Route 1; (iii) higher productivity in 

rainfed and irrigated crop production; (iv) protection of intervention basins through 

sand-dune stabilization; (v) the upgrading of pastoral trails and water points; and 

(vi) the social and economic integration of refugee groups. 

17. The expected result is expressed in two outcomes: 

(i) The emergence of sustainable family farms enables 20,000 rural households, 

30 per cent made up of refugees, 30 per cent women and 30 per cent young 

adults, to diversify their production (crops and livestock) and boost their 

yields (30 per cent) and resilience to external shocks, notably those that are 

climate-related. 

(ii) Thirty per cent of the 20,000 rural farmers, 30 per cent of them refugees, 

30 per cent women and 30 per cent young adults, obtain higher income from 

their surplus agro-sylvo-pastoral production thanks to higher sales in the 

markets that supply national consumer centres and cross-border markets. 

C. Components/outcomes 

Component 1: Strengthening of sustainable family farming 

18. The objective of this component is to sustainably boost the productivity of family 

farms. It has three sub-components: (i) structured and productive climate-resilient 

farms; (ii) strengthening of the technical and economic capacity of family farms; 

and (iii) resilience of vulnerable populations.  

19. Component 1 consists of: (i)(a) the development of sub-watersheds 

(3,000 hectares) and promotion of the pastoral water subsector through water and 



EB 2018/LOT/P.15 

4 

soil conservation works and soil protection and restoration, the rehabilitation of 

pastoral corridors and water points and (i)(b) the development of areas for 

irrigated crop production (360 hectares); (ii) the strengthening of agricultural 

technical capacity to enable family farms to diversify their production and increase 

crop yields by 30 per cent, and the improvement of sedentary livestock production 

to boost herd productivity and reduce conflicts over the use of natural resources; 

and (iii) activities preparatory to action on behalf of refugees and the promotion of 

women’s leadership and nutrition security. 

Component 2: Market access 

20. This component has three sub-components: (i) the structural development of 

sustainable market access; (ii) the promotion of rural microenterprises and youth 

employment; and (iii) market access and regional trade integration. 

21. Component 2 consists of: (i) the rehabilitation or building of economic 

infrastructure to improve trade flows in existing markets in the five EDPs; (ii) the 

sustainable management of economic infrastructure through specific social 

engineering; (iii) the promotion of rural microenterprises to benefit local and 

refugee populations; (iv) financing for the vocational training and equipping of 

young adults (30 per cent of them young women) for work in farming-related 

agricultural activities or non-agricultural activities; and (v) actions aimed at 

strengthening the policy dialogue on increasing EDP connectivity through wholesale 

markets and sales platforms in subregional transport corridors. 

Component 3: Programme management and coordination, monitoring and 

evaluation and knowledge management  

22. This component includes the administrative and financial operations, management 

and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of the programme. 

III. Programme implementation 

A. Approach 

23. ProDAF-Diffa’s implementation will follow the ProDAF principles applied in the 

Maradi, Tahoua and Zinder regions while considering the specific context of Diffa, 

marked by the presence of refugee populations among the beneficiaries.  

24. The programme approach is based on the following intervention principles: 

 The improvement of food and nutrition security, considering the dimensions 

of food availability, accessibility and use through stable mechanisms; 

 Geographical continuity of the interventions through the EDPs, which includes 

the wholesale market connected by rural feeder roads to satellite collection 

points in the production areas, themselves surrounded by watersheds; and  

 The scaling up of ProDAF to benefit the Diffa region. 

B. Organizational framework 

25. The Ministry of Agriculture will be responsible for project oversight and 

implementation. The national steering committee will be responsible for the 

strategic orientation of the programme, ensure compliance with the financing 

agreements and the programme’s alignment with national strategies and approve 

the annual work plans and budgets (AWP/B). It will be presided over by the 

General Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and consist of representatives of 

government agencies and the beneficiaries. 

26. Programme coordination and management, overseen by the Ministry of Agriculture, 

will be handled by a regional programme management unit (RPMU) based in Diffa 

with technical, administrative and financial autonomy. 



EB 2018/LOT/P.15 

5 

27. ProDAF’s national technical assistance unit, based in Niamey and Maradi, will 

provide ad hoc technical assistance for programme implementation, as needed, 

particularly in the areas of fiduciary, administrative and technical management.  

C. Planning, monitoring and evaluation and learning and 
knowledge management  

28. Planning. The RPMU will be responsible for consolidating the AWP/Bs prepared by 

the technical partners in keeping with the regulations and timetables and based on 

targeted discussions at the local level. It will be co-responsible for organizing and 

serving as the secretariat for the national steering committee’s sessions with the 

other RPMUs. The AWP/B will be validated by the national steering committee and 

submitted for IFAD's prior approval. 

29. Monitoring and evaluation. The purpose of the M&E system will be to furnish 
reliable current data on the programme’s implementation and facilitate 
decision-making. It will be linked to ProDAF’s comprehensive M&E system. The 
RPMU in Diffa will take the data collected from forms completed in the field by 

implementation operatives/partners and enter it in ProDAF’s consolidated 

harmonized database. IFAD and the Government will conduct a joint midterm 

review in year three of the programme.  

30. Learning and knowledge management. The purpose of knowledge management 
in ProDAF-Diffa will be: (i) to encourage personnel involved in the implementation 
of programme activities to regularly describe and document the knowledge gained 

during implementation (capitalization); and (ii) to systematically store (either 

manually or electronically) the documentary output (reports, studies, terms of 

reference, notes, etc.) of the various programme actors and facilitate its use 

(as part of knowledge sharing). 

D. Financial management, procurement and governance 

31. The programme’s administrative and financial management, as well as its fiduciary 

aspects, will be based on ProDAF’s existing configuration and mechanisms. 

ProDAF’s financial management risk is considered “moderate.” 

32. Programme funds will be managed according to the terms of the financial 

agreements. The administrative and financial management procedures will be 

detailed in the letter to the borrower and the manual of internal administrative, 

financial, accounting and monitoring procedures. The manual will take the 

distinctive features of the programme into account, specifically the multiple sources 

of financing and the number of intervention regions, as well as the particular risks 

of the Diffa region.  

33. Flow of funds. A dedicated account in CFA francs for the deposit of the respective 

loan and grant funds and an operational account in CFA francs will be opened in the 

name of the programme at a reputable commercial bank. Disbursements from 

these accounts will require two signatures.  

34. The programme coordination unit will prepare quarterly financial and accounting 

statements, which it will transmit to the Government and IFAD, along with the 

financial statements for programme operations, which will be subject to an annual 

external audit.  

35. Pursuant to IFAD guidelines, an external audit of the financial statements will be 

performed annually. It will adhere to the International Standards on Auditing and 

comply with IFAD Guidelines on Project Audits. The audited financial statements 

will be published on IFAD’s official website.  

  



EB 2018/LOT/P.15

36. Procurement. Procurement is governed by: (i) Law No. 2011/037 of 28 October 

2011, containing the general principles, controls and regulations governing public 

contracts and the outsourcing of public services; (ii) Decree No. 2014-070/PRN/MF 

of 12 February 2014 on a priori supervision of procurement procedures, which is 

exercised by the Directorate for Public Procurement and Financial Covenants; and 

(iii) Decree No. 2016-641/PRN/PM of 1 December 2016 on the code for 

procurement and the outsourcing of public services. 

E. Supervision 

37. Programme supervision will be carried out directly by IFAD and the Government, 

represented by the Ministry of Agriculture, in collaboration with the other 

departments involved, the programme coordination unit and relevant partners, 

notably NORAD. In addition, IFAD will organize implementation support missions, 

as needed.  

IV. Programme costs, financing and benefits

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis  

41. The analysis of the financial return of the activities shows that for rainfed crops, 

the respective internal rates of return (IRR), net present values (NPV) and cost-

benefit ratios are on the order of: (i) for millet, IRR of 21.20 per cent, NPV of 

FCFA 15,135 and cost-benefit ratio of 1:7; (ii) for sorghum, IRR of 16.3 per cent, 

NPV of FCFA 7,206 and cost-benefit ratio of 1:3; and (iii) for groundnut, IRR of 

23.40 per cent, NPV FCFA 37,772 and cost-benefit ratio of 1:2. 

42. The additional margins for irrigated crops are FCFA 661,697 and FCFA 739,000 for 

peppers and rice, respectively. The IRR for onions is 62.8 per cent, with an NPV of 

FCFA 11 million and a cost-benefit ratio of 2:2. These results show that a farmer 

can handle the additional costs of adopting improved production techniques to clear 

additional income.  

43. Goat raising in these groups is also a profitable venture, with an IRR of 

43.7 per cent, an NPV de FCFA 642,219 and a cost-benefit ratio of 1:3. 

44. The financial analysis of the operating accounts of the various market stakeholders 

(farmers, collectors, warehousers, merchants/wholesalers, communities/ 

municipalities, market management groups) shows a satisfactory return for the 

different types of market investments, with IRRs ranging from 14.2 to 48 per cent.  

45. The programme’s overall economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 21.6 per cent, 

and the NPV of the net economic cash flow will be US$13 million. This preliminary 

result is satisfactory. With a 10 per cent increase in sales prices, the EIRR is 

around 23.6 per cent. A 15, 20 and 30 per cent drop in the yield of rainfed crops 

reduces the EIRRs to 18.9 per cent, 17.3 per cent and 14.0 per cent, respectively, 

while a 10 per cent increase in costs yields an EIRR of 19.6 per cent.  

D. Sustainability 

46. ProDAF-Diffa employs an approach based on increasing resilience that applies the 

lessons learned in neighbouring regions while tackling the challenges stemming 

from population movements triggered by the security situation. The programme’s 

primary goal is therefore to increase the sustainability of the proposed practices 

and the installations introduced by the programme. The sustainability of the 

interventions will be guaranteed by choosing practices and activities that have 

proven effective over decades, with a high rate of adoption by rural populations. 

47. From a technical standpoint, the activities under components 1 and 2 are based on 

social engineering that links each intervention, from the lowland parcel to the 

subwatershed, to its users through commune management and association 

committees with recognized competencies.  

48. From a social standpoint, the programme approach will be inclusive, and support 

will be provided to all target groups without discrimination. To this end, instead of 

setting up specific organizations for refugee groups, the programme will encourage 

populations to participate in existing or newly created village associations. This 

approach will better integrate the communities to implement the activities and 

capitalize on the opportunities offered. 

49. From an economic standpoint, the increased volume and value of farm production, 

together with greater market opportunities, will be the incentives for beneficiary 

engagement. 

E. Risk identification and mitigation 

50. ProDAF-Diffa’s implementation will face risks associated with the climate and 

security situation in the region, the security risk remaining unpredictable and high. 

The environmental and social risks make it a “Category B” project. Since the region 

is Sahelian, the project is classified as having a “high climate risk” due to the risks 

associated with climate change. The risk assessment was taken into account in the 



EB 2018/LOT/P.15 

11 

Environmental and Social Management Plan. The anticipated mechanisms and 

interventions will mitigate the adverse effects of the risks on the activities. Since 

ProDAF-Diffa is an extension of ProDAF, numerous risks are substantially mitigated 

by the very fact of its institutional integration and the recognized experience of 

ProDAF. Nevertheless, in order to lower ProDAF-Diffa’s risk in the implementation 

phase from “high” to “moderate,” as in the case of ProDAF, the new structure 

includes an internal risk auditor to better control the risks. The main risks and 

mitigation measures put the overall programme risk at the “moderate” level.  

V. Corporate considerations 

A. Compliance with IFAD policies 

51. ProDAF-Diffa is aligned with IFAD’s Strategic Framework 2016-2025, centred on 

inclusive and sustainable transformation of the rural world. ProDAF-Diffa will 

contribute to meeting IFAD’s three strategic objectives, namely: (i) increase poor 

rural people’s productive capacities; (ii) increase poor rural people’s benefits from 

market participation; and (iii) strengthen the environmental sustainability and 

climate resilience of poor rural people’s economic activities.  

52. The activities implemented under ProDAF-Diffa (development of water points, 

pastoral areas, stabilization of dunes surrounding water points, support for 

agricultural inputs) will have a limited, reversible, and easily mitigated 

environmental and social impact. Moreover, they will take place in small areas and 

be on the scale of the activities implemented under ProDAF in the neighbouring 

regions, where the adverse social and environmental impacts were considered 

minimal and very localized. It is therefore proposed that ProDAF-Diffa be classified 

as an environmental and social category “B” programme. 

B. Alignment and harmonization 

53. The programme’s targeting strategy is aligned with IFAD’s targeting policy. 

ProDAF-Diffa is aligned with the Government’s recommendations in favour of the 

interventions in the Diffa context, considering the refugee, displaced and returning 

populations in the country who wish to engage in family farming. The programme 

will also ensure that this aspect will be taken into account in the monitoring of 

programme results and the impact assessment (with data disaggregated by sex, 

age and origin). ProDAF-Diffa is aligned with Niger’s Small-scale Irrigation 

Strategy.  

C. Innovations and scaling up 

54. ProDAF-Diffa is the product of a scaling up of ProDAF’s achievements and approach 

in the neighbouring regions. In particular, it has the following features:  

 The economic development pole (EDP) approach. The EDP approach, 

which consists of concentrating a coherent and complementary group of 

support activities in a production area to amplify their impact, was 

successfully implemented in 2012-2013 in the Project to Support Food 

Security in the Maradi Region (PASADEM) and the Ruwanmu Small-scale 

Irrigation Project (PPI Ruwanmu). It has been employed in current ProDAF 

activities in the Maradi, Tahoua and Zinder regions and is now used as a 

model in the intervention strategies of the government and certain partners. 

This approach will be replicated in this programme.  

 Farmer field schools and water user associations. These tools will be 

promoted by the programme based on the current ProDAF experience. 

 Assisted natural tree regeneration. This simple and inexpensive technical 

innovation for managing the natural regeneration of trees has had a very 

positive impact in projects promoted by IFAD since the 1980s.

D. Policy engagement  

55. ProDAF-Diffa interventions are aligned with the lines of action in the Plan of Action 

2016-2020 of the 3N Initiative "Nigeriens Nourishing Nigeriens," especially: 

(i) water management for agro-sylvo-pastoral and fish production; (ii) the 

promotion of agro-sylvo-pastoral and fish value chains; and (iii) integrated and 

sustainable natural resource management and environmental protection. These 

lines of action are also part of the Diffa Regional Development Plan (2016-2020) 

and IFAD’s country strategic opportunities programme (COSOP) 2013-2021. 

By focusing its efforts on the problem of assisting refugees, the programme is also 

aligned with the Facility for Refugees, Migrants, Forced Displacement and Rural 

Stability (FARMS), developed by IFAD and its partners to help displaced persons 

become more independent and strengthen the resilience of receiving communities. 

Therefore, the programme will generally support Niger’s Sustainable Development 

and Inclusive Growth Strategy 2035 (SDDCI – Niger 2035). 

VI. Legal instruments and authority 
56. The financing agreement between the Republic of the Niger and IFAD will 

constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the 

borrower/recipient. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached in 

appendix I. 

57. The Republic of the Niger is empowered under its laws to receive financing from 

IFAD. 

58. I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement 

Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing. 

VII. Recommendation 
59. I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of 

the following resolution: 

RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on highly concessional terms to 

the Republic of the Niger in the amount of five million three hundred seventy 

thousand euros (EUR 5,370,000) and upon such terms and conditions as shall 

be substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions presented 

herein. 

RESOLVED FURTHER: that the Fund shall provide a Debt Sustainability 

Framework grant to the Republic of the Niger in the amount of five million 

three hundred seventy thousand euros (EUR 5,370,000) and upon such terms 

and conditions as shall be substantially in accordance with the terms and 

conditions presented herein.
