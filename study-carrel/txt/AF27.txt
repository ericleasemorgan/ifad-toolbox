PROGRAMME SUMMARY 

Overview: Mali covers an area of 1,241,238 km² and the rural sector is the mainspring of its 

development, with agriculture accounting for 45% of GDP, providing employment for 80% of 

the total population and generating more than 75% of export earnings. However, it is constantly 

subject to climatic hazards, degradation of its natural resources (degradation of soil, water, air, 

vegetation, biodiversity, climate, etc.) and deterioration of terms of trade (steady drop in the 

prices of its agricultural export products), which limit the incomes of the rural population and 

expose them, particularly young people, to immigration. 

The degradation of natural resources results in land production loss of 6.5 T/ha/year, which 

corresponds to significant losses of soil nutrients, with a financial impact of up to CFAF 

90,000/ha/year (Strategic Investment Framework for Sustainable Land Management (SIF-

SLM)). All the environmental degradation-related factors (soil erosion, deforestation, air, 

quality of life, water and solid waste, wildlife heritage, mineral resources, etc.) have a 

significant impact on GDP which has declined from 26.5% to 20.9%. 

In addition, the value-added created by the agro-industry sector (biscuits, pasta, confectionery, 

canning industry, brewery, bakery, oil works, sugar refinery, dairy products, textile and 

tobacco) fell by 46.61% from XOF 1,465.64 billion in 2013 to XOF 782.48 billion in 2014. 

This trend is continuing, with annual agro-food imports for about EUR 597 million to fill the 

gap. The foreign exchange losses are enormous, and high enough to develop the entire 

programme of the country's twelve (12) agricultural growth poles (agropoles). 

The Development Programme for the Special Agro-industrial Processing Zone of Koulikoro 

and Semi-urban Bamako Regions (PDZSTA-KB) is a proposal to reverse the downward trend 

in agro-industry value added in Mali and disseminate agricultural development technologies 

that can slow down the degradation of natural resources, thereby creating conditions for 

sustainable agriculture, with the support of an additional contribution of the Italian Government 

to TSF Pilar I. The programme will include sustainable land management (SLM) at each stage 

of the proposed technical itineraries, within and outside irrigation areas, unlike extensive or 

intensive agricultural practices that foster the excessive use of agrochemicals. 

The Bank's intervention will help to develop two (2) major regions of Mali with an area of 

28,571.43 km² (2.30% of the country's total area), a population of 1.6 million inhabitants 

(8.63% of the total population in 2017) and an annual growth rate of 3.4%. The population 

density of 56 inhabitants/km² is well above the national average of 14 inhabitants/km². 

Consequently, there is heavy pressure on natural resources, which are rapidly deteriorating in 

the absence of any strong action to control, monitor and curb the trend. 

Needs Assessment: The programme area covers two (2) regions (Koulikoro and Semi-urban 

Bamako) whose irrigation and socio-economic development requires facilities for the 

production and processing of agricultural products that constitute the regions’ potential. The 

programme involves establishing an agro-industrial park to process products upstream and 

serve as an outlet for marketing agricultural products, thereby helping to reduce all-out import 

of agro-food products whose volume and incurred expenditure are becoming alarming.  

In accordance with the country's strategic guidelines, the programme will contribute to the 

processing of agricultural products, while improving the productivity and production of growth 

sectors. This will reduce imports of various agro-food products, with the main outcome of 

transforming Malian agriculture and improving food and nutrition security. 



 

 

 

v 

Added Value for the Bank: PDZSTA-KB seeks to support Mali in its agricultural 

transformation programme by promoting private investment, as well as creating conditions and 

providing incentives likely to attract the national and international private sector to establish in 

Bacoumana agro-industrial park (AIP). The conditions and measures include: (i) adopting 

measures that can create an enabling business environment for the establishment of agro-

industrial enterprises in the agro-industrial park; (ii) constructing physical and smart long-term 

infrastructure to facilitate the establishment of private companies, their operations, and 

transactions related to their activities; and (iii) improving the operation of growth sectors. This 

innovative approach was proposed as a flagship programme of the Bank's Feed Africa Strategy 

2016-2025, known as the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones (SAPZs) Flagship 

Programme. It proposes an approach to increase private investment in the agricultural sector, 

with the Government creating favourable conditions. Therefore, this is an area in which the 

Bank has experience and expertise. It can also raise internal financial resources, as well as 

additional resources from its technical and financial partners and private banks, relying on its 

“Triple A” rating. The Bank has also gained experience in developing this type of operation in 

Togo, Ethiopia, Guinea, DRC, Zambia and Tanzania. Hence, it can develop this operation with 

a high probability of success.  

Knowledge Building and Management: The implementation of the Development Programme 

for Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones (PDZSTA-KB) will provide a wealth of 

knowledge that can be replicated throughout the country's twelve (12) agricultural development 

poles, including those in Koulikoro and Semi-urban Bamako Regions. The knowledge 

concerns: (i) the best way to work with the private sector, through a PPP approach or as a non-

sovereign operation (NSO), or a combination of both; (ii) the multi-sector approach, involving 

sectors such as transport, energy, water and sanitation, agro-industry, agriculture, 

communication (NICT), education, health and nutrition, employment and trade; (iii) a 

combination of: (a) two Bank Strategies, namely "Feed Africa" and Skills Development, 

especially for young people, and (b) at least four (4) flagship programmes, namely, Special 

Agro-Industrial Processing Zones (SAPZ), Technologies for African Agricultural 

Transformation (TAAT), Agricultural Value Chains (AVC), Post-Harvest Loss Reduction and 

Youth Employability (Enable Youth);  (iv) product processing, as a major development 

challenge for which solutions will be sought in this programme; (v) employment in general and 

in the agricultural sector in particular, as a solution proposed in the programme; and (vi) 

contribution to reducing massive agro-food imports from the continent, and from Mali, in 

particular.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION BY BANK GROUP MANAGEMENT TO THE 

BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON A DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME FOR SPECIAL 

AGRO-INDUSTRIAL PROCESSING ZONES IN BOKE AND KANKAN 

 
Management submits this report and its recommendation concerning a proposal for an ADF 

Grant of UA 1.42 million, a TSF Grant of UA 2.262 million (including an additional 

contribution of the Republic of Italy to  TSF Pillar I of EUR 1.38 million, i.e. UA 1.102 

million), and a TSF Loan of UA 10.50 million, from the ADF and TSF country allocation, to 

the Government of the Republic of Mali to finance the activities of PDZSTA-KB, which is the 

Pilot Phase of Mali’s Agropoles Development Programme. 

I. STRATEGIC THRUST AND RATIONALE 

Programme Linkages with Country Strategy and Objectives 

1.1.1. The programme is consistent with three (3) of the five (5) strategic pillars of the 

Strategic Framework for Economic Recovery and Sustainable Development (CREDD) 2019-

2023, namely: (i) Inclusive growth and structural transformation of the economy (Pillar 3); (ii) 

Environmental protection and building resilience to climate change; and (iii) Human capital 

development. CREDD serves as a framework for intervention by Mali's various Technical and 

Financial Partners. It is aligned with the MDGs and the objectives of the African Union's 

Agenda 2063, and aims at "A well-governed Mali, where harmonious coexistence of the various 

components of the society is restored, peace consolidated and collective and individual security 

ensured in unity, cohesion and diversity, where the wealth creation process is inclusive and 

environment-friendly, and where human capital is developed for the benefit of the population, 

particularly young people and women".  

1.1.2 At sector level, CREDD is implemented under Mali's Agricultural Development 

Policy (PDA) and includes the Development Programme for the Special Agro-Industrial 

Processing Zones of Koulikoro and Semi-urban Bamako (PDZSTA-KB). It is also implemented 

through its priority activities of developing agricultural products, protecting livelihoods and 

resilience to climate change, and enhancing human capital. The activities will, as a result of 

improved living conditions, promote sedentary lifestyles and reduce migration among the 

population. Therefore, PDZSTA-KB is a PDA operational programme which guides efforts 

towards achieving 6% growth in agricultural added value and allocating 15% of the State budget 

to the agricultural sector (10% in Maputo Commitment). Indeed, PDZSTA-KB is fully 

consistent with the country's strategic objectives. 

Programme Alignment with Bank Policy 

1.2.1 The Bank's intervention, through PDZSTA-KB which is the pilot phase of a 

programme for twelve (12) agropoles, is considered a priority by the Bank. Consequently, the 

Bank has made the strategic choice of transforming Malian agriculture, as reflected in Pillar II 

of CSP 2015-2019: "Infrastructure development to support economic recovery". The 

programme is also consistent with three (3) of the High 5s, namely: (i) Feed Africa (Strategy 

for Agricultural Transformation in Africa 2016-2025); (iii) Industrialise Africa; (iv) Integrate 

Africa; and (v) Improve the quality of life for the people of Africa. The programme’s alignment 

with Bank policy is further underscored by the fact that it will also help to enhance the 

transformation of Malian agriculture, boost industrialisation, and increase Mali's energy 

capacity. Specifically, it will help to promote smart agriculture, with product processing on all 

links of the priority value chains fostered under this programme.

Rationale for Bank Intervention 

1.3.1 The rural sector is the mainspring of Mali's development. It accounts for 45% of GDP, 

employs 80% of the total population, and generates more than 75% of export earnings. 

Therefore, agriculture is the main source of income for the rural population. However, 

agriculture is constantly subject to climatic hazards, degradation of natural resources 

(degradation of soil, water, air, vegetation, biodiversity, climate, etc.), and deterioration of 

terms of trade (steady drop in the prices of agricultural export products), which limit the 

incomes of the rural population. Indeed, the degradation of natural resources stems from 

inappropriate agricultural practices, and is the main cause of recurrent drought, leading to rapid 

destruction of livelihoods and threatening Mali's future, with negative effects on the country's 

food and nutrition security. All the environmental degradation-related factors (soil erosion, 

deforestation, air, quality of life, water and solid waste, wildlife heritage, mineral resources, 

etc.) have contributed to GDP decline from 26.5% to 20.9%. 

1.3.2 The deterioration of terms of trade is due to the low level of transformation of Mali's 

agriculture, and therefore of Mali’s economy. The value-added created by the agro-industry 

sector (biscuits, pasta, confectionery, canning industry, brewery, bakery, oil works, sugar 

refinery, dairy products, textile and tobacco) fell by 46.61% from XOF 1,465.64 billion in 2013 

to XOF 782.48 billion in 2014. This trend is continuing, and Mali is forced to import the 

equivalent of about EUR 597 million worth of agro-food products each year to fill the gap. The 

foreign exchange losses are enormous, and high enough to develop the entire programme of the 

country's twelve (12) agropoles. 

1.3.3 PDZSTA-KB is a proposal to reverse the downward trend in agro-industry value-

added in Mali and disseminate agricultural development technologies that can slow down the 

degradation of natural resources, thereby creating conditions for sustainable agriculture. The 

first principle of the programme is to group all the companies within an agro-industrial park 

(AIP) serviced to the required standards so as to avoid disorganised installations that breach 

environmental protection requirements. The second principle of PDZSTA-KB is that the AIP 

will be supplied with inputs from land developed in accordance with practices that include 

sustainable land management (SLM) at each stage of the proposed technical itineraries, within 

and outside irrigation areas, unlike the current inadequate agricultural practices in the area. The 

third principle is to upgrade the skills of young people and women in growth agricultural value 

chains and enable them to effectively benefit from future jobs that will be created within the 

AIPs. In the process, the programme will create conditions that promote sedentary lifestyles 

and reduce migration from the programme area to other countries or to hazardous gold panning 

activities. 

1.3.4 Since the programme incorporates the Bank's relevant strategies, it will effectively 

boost economic development by consolidating the role of the private sector and communities 

in rural development to ensure inclusiveness in Africa and in Mali, in particular. Furthermore, 

its design is based on complementarities with operations underway and/or being developed, 

particularly operations relating to women’s economic empowerment in the shea sector 

(PAEFEK). It also seeks to strengthen food and nutrition security in Koulikoro region 

(PRESAN-KL), as well as enhance food security by developing irrigated crops (PRESA-DCI). 

Such complementarity will contribute to the search for synergies in interventions. Therefore, 

this programme will strive to benefit from ongoing activities in Koulikoro and semi-urban 

Bamako regions, particularly the operations of the World Bank (PATAM, etc.) and IsDB, so as 

to ensure its relevance and effectiveness on the ground.

Aid Coordination 

1.4.1 Development assistance is coordinated by the Government of Mali, through the 

following three (3) consultation and coordination mechanisms: (i) At the general and policy 

level, a Troika; (ii) at the sector and thematic level, and (iii) at the sub-sector level. All TFPs 

align their interventions with the priorities of the Malian Government. In the rural development 

sector, the TFPs are organised around the Agricultural and Rural Economy Thematic Group 

(ARETG), which coordinates activities related to the sector. The group has two subgroups: 

"Livestock and Fisheries" and "Food and Nutrition Security ", as well as an "Irrigation" Focal 

Point replacing the Irrigation Sub-Group, which has been abolished. The AfDB, WB, IFAD, 

IsDB, GIZ, AFD, Netherlands and FAO are the main financial partners in the rural sector. As 

regards Mali’s external financing, the Bank comes second to the World Bank, with 13% of the 

financing. 

1.4.2 The Bank, through COML, is an active member of the CCC and some Thematic 

Groups (TG), particularly the Environment and Climate Change TG comprising UNDP, 

Sweden, Belgium, Norway, European Union, Canada, World Bank, UNCDF, France, Spain 

and Netherlands. The Bank works closely with the TFPs in this group in GEF activities. Such 

collaboration facilitates the exchange of best practice.

II. PROGRAMME DESCRIPTION 

Programme Components 

2.1.1 The Development Programme for the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zone in 

Koulikoro and Semi-Urban Bamako Regions (PDZSTA-KB) is the Pilot Phase of a 

development programme for twelve (12) agro-industrial processing zones. It is intended to help 

reduce agro-food imports and improve food and nutrition security in Mali by establishing 

private sector-led agro-industrial development poles. The poles will address migration-related 

fragility factors in Koulikoro area by promoting sedentary lifestyles among the population, 

especially young people, who suffer from problems of deterioration of livelihoods (natural 

resources), climate change, "sahelisation" and extremely rapid desert encroachment. The 

programme will be implemented through the following four (4) components: (i) Establishment 

of Governance in the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones (SAPZs); (ii) Development of 



 

4 

 

Transformation and Access Infrastructure; (iii) Capacity Building for Key Stakeholders of 

Growth Sectors; and (iv) Programme Coordination and Management.  

2.1.2 The programme will be based on production activities, as well as the construction of 

access and marketing infrastructure for ongoing operations or operations under appraisal for 

2019, upstream Bancoumana agro-industrial park, for the supply of inputs for the pilot phase. 

The operations are the Bank's PRESAN-KL (UA 36.06 million), the Bank's Programme for 

Enhancing Food Security through Irrigated Crop Development (PRESA-DCI) (UA 36.00 

million), and the Bank's Women’s Economic Empowerment Project in the Shea Sector 

(PAEFFK (UA 5.63 million). This requires supplementary financing amounting to the 

equivalent of EUR 97.27 million. In addition to these Bank portfolio operations, other donors 

are very active in the programme area, particularly the World Bank, IsDB, European Union, 

etc. Under these conditions, the pilot phase of the programme will not be exposed to the risk of 

lack of input production and supplies to Bancoumana agro-park, if the activities are properly 

coordinated between the various operations mentioned above.

Technical Solutions Adopted and Alternatives Considered 

2.2.1 PDZSTA-KB seeks to address the central issue of the transformation of Malian 

agriculture in a way that puts the private sector in a leading role, while the public sector 

strives to create incentive conditions that will attract private investors to developed and 

serviced agro-industrial parks. It is an agricultural development approach that creates 

Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones (SAPZs). The SAPZs are spatial development 

initiatives based on agriculture and designed to concentrate agricultural transformation 

activities in areas with high agricultural potential so as to boost productivity and integrate 

the production, processing and marketing of a number of agricultural inputs. The initiatives 

may or may not have Special Economic Zone status. They are, in some cases, also known 

as Agro-Industial Parks, Agribusiness Parks, Mega Food Parks, Agropoles, Agro-Clusters, 

etc. 

2.2.2 It is an integrated and pragmatic approach that has innovations, is inclusive on all 

links of agricultural value chains (AVCs) and creates wealth through the jobs it generates. 

It also creates wealth by reducing foreign exchange outflows as a result of cuts in agro-food 

imports. The approach also reduces emigration by promoting sedentary lifestyles among the 

population who now find huge employment opportunities and wealth creation at their 

doorstep. In addition, it pools the efforts of all other sectors that contribute to the success 

of agricultural development, particularly industry, transport, energy, water and NICT, even 

within the Bank. It also includes interventions by other development partners in the 

systematic search for complementarity to generate synergy. In the case of PDZSTA-KB, 

the development partners are the World Bank, IFAD, European Union, BCEAO, IsDB, etc. 

2.2.5 Therefore, SAPZ technical solutions break with the traditional approach of 

improving productivity, production and sales, without specifying their content .

Table 2.2   

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED AND REASONS FOR REJECTION  

ALTERNATIVES BRIEF DESCRIPTION CAUSES FOR REJECTION 

Traditional approach of 

agricultural programmes 

Approach of improving productivity, 

production and sales 

This approach has no AVC content, and has 

therefore stumbled against field realities on 

key issues such as processing, markets and 

opportunities. 

Single-sector approach, 

based on agriculture 

Sector approach based exclusively on 

agricultural activities 

It does not include other development 

sectors that have an impact on agricultural 

development and therefore constitute 

success factors for this sector. 

Use of the Bank's public 

resources mainly 

The programmes are financed mainly from 

the resources of the Bank's public window and 

those of the Government 

AVC financing needs to go beyond the 

Bank's public resources, as they include 

private sector financing, co-financing from 

development partners, and non-sovereign 

operations. 

Dissemination of 

technological innovations 

according to the 

conventional method of 

training and visit to 

producers 

Approach based on regular visits to producers, 

according to a specific schedule and based on 

a control framework with tools such as 

contact group (CG), observation point (OP), 

and system study point (SSP) 

In addition to being cumbersome and costly, 

this method has shown its limitations in the 

past and is less effective than the client-

supplier system, which focuses on 

developing skills in all relevant fields of 

activity. 

Programme Type 

The Development Programme for Special Agro-industrial Processing Zones (PDZSTA-BK) is 

a programme that is facilitated by the public sector through major public investments to 

stimulate private sector interest in investing in growth by providing leadership to the 

programme, particularly in the processing of agricultural products, the supply of agricultural 

inputs and services, and marketing. It is a programme that will be implemented in several 

phases, depending on successive ADF allocations and mobilisation of additional resources from 

development partners. 

Programme Cost and Financing Arrangements  

2.1.1 Programme Cost: The overall cost of the twelve (12) agropoles programme is estimated 
at UA 660 million (about EUR 826.32 million), with the first phase estimated at UA 55.00 million 

(XOF 45.17 billion) which will start with a pilot operation estimated at UA 16.26 million (XOF 

13.36 billion), exclusive of tax and customs duty. This cost comprises UA 8.83 million (XOF 7.25 

billion) in foreign exchange and UA 7.44 million (XOF 6.11 billion) in local currency. It also 

includes provisions for physical contingencies and price escalation, which are estimated at an 

average of 3% and 4% respectively. The provision for price escalation was estimated on the basis 

of current and programmed levels of cost inflation rates in local and foreign currencies of 2.5% and 

1.8% respectively per year on average. The provision for physical contingencies is estimated at 

between 0 and 7%. A summary of the programme cost estimate by component and expenditure 

category is presented in the tables below.

Programme Area and Beneficiaries 

2.5.1 The programme area covers three districts, namely Kangaba, Kati and Koulikoro, in 

addition to Bamako District, with a population of 1.6 million inhabitants, of whom at least 79% 

are employed in agriculture. The site identified for the agro-industrial park is located in Kati 

District, Siby District, and Bancoumana rural municipality, 50 km from Bamako District. The 

area has Mali's most vulnerable communities due mainly to the alarming degradation of natural 

resources, climate change and the misperception of gold panning and migration as lucrative 

ventures. The entire programme area will cover 60,000 ha and will directly affect at least one-

third of the agricultural population, or about 421,000 people, and indirectly affect at least 1.2 

million people. The area is economically very dynamic, with the exploitation of precious 

minerals. Therefore, the programme area will include development works already financed by 

the Bank covering an area of about 2,921 ha, an agro-park of about 200 ha in Bancoumana, as 

well as areas outside the scope of this programme, i.e. more than 60,000 ha. 

2.5.2 The programme area’s population is young, with an average age of about 20 years. 

The population under 15 years of age accounts for 50.8% of the total population. On the other 

hand, the 15-59 age group accounts for 45.1% of the total population. Specifically, Bancoumana 

rural municipality has a population of 23,577 inhabitants (GPHC 2009), with 10,456 men and 

11,635 women, and 48 and 52% respectively of the population.  The young people tend to 

migrate to other economic sectors such as gold panning or very often to other countries in the 

sub-region and the West because of natural challenges and economic realities with very few 

alternatives. 

Participatory Approach to Programme Identification, Design and  Implementation  

2.6.1 The participatory approach, based on consultation, was the guiding principle for the 

programme design. The approach was adopted for discussions and consultations with officials 

of the relevant ministries (Agriculture, Industry, Transport, Energy, Trade, etc.), public 

administrations, the private sector, local authorities (Bancoumana, Kangaba and Kati), farmer 

organisations, civil society and TFPs (IsDB, BOAD, BCEAO, World Bank, European Union, 

and bilateral cooperation agencies). It was implemented in the following stages: (i) the country 

team prepared and proposed the terms of reference for the environmental and social 

assessments; (ii) the Bank team drafted a programme preparation report; (iii) the programme 

document was reviewed for approval by the Board of Directors; (iv) there were broad 

stakeholder consultations during the programme preparation in Bamako and Bancoumana, 

particularly in the assessment of environmental safeguard measures required for environmental 

categorisation and publication of the summary Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment

(SESA) report; (v) the consultations continued during the appraisal mission, field visits to 

Bancoumana, meetings with all stakeholders and key actors (civil society, public 

administration, private sector, and technical and financial partners) in Bamako. 

2.6.2 This proposal is also a response to strong demand from grassroots communities 

because despite the huge potential of the regions concerned, there was inadequate agricultural 

development in the areas. The participatory approach will continue during the programme 

implementation through: (i) a steering structure with representatives of all the parties; (ii) 

capacity building in participatory approach for the institutions and communities; and (iii) 

community involvement in the implementation of activities; and (iv) implementation of a 

monitoring and evaluation system focused on programme outcomes.  In addition, the Bank's 

Country Office in Mali will, on a permanent basis, ensure that the consultation platform is 

operational throughout the programme implementation. 

Bank Group Experience and Lessons reflected in Programme Design 

2.7.1 PDZSTA formulation incorporates lessons learned from the Bank's past and ongoing 

operations in Mali and across regional member countries, taking into account portfolio 

performance issues and the country's fragility. The lessons were included in the last review. 

The Bank's active portfolio in Mali has twenty-three (23) operations (with 3 regional and 3 

private sector) for an approved amount of UA 430.3 million. The gross disbursement rate for 

operations that have already started their activities is 35%. At the end of the review, the 

performance of the Bank's national public portfolio in Mali in 2018 was deemed satisfactory 

with a rating of 3 out of 4.  However, it noted that more efforts were needed to focus more on 

the following aspects: (i) the need for the baseline situation and measurable performance 

indicators; (ii) the importance of effective supervision and regular meetings with stakeholders; 

(iii) the need for an integrated approach that involves key stakeholders of the sector; (iv) the 

utility of a good communication plan; (v) the need for a good selection mechanism for 

contractors eligible for projects; (vi) the need to strengthen the technical and managerial 

capacities of social groups, particularly young people and women entrepreneurs, in addition to 

access to financing; and (vii) initiatives should not be limited to a percentage of women (30%). 

2.7.2 The Portfolio Performance Improvement Plan (PPIP 2018) also recommended specific 

measures to accelerate programme implementation. Incorporating the recommendations in this 

proposal has resulted in: (i) maintaining dialogue with stakeholders, and ensuring close 

monitoring by the Bank's Country Office (COML) to reduce risks of delays in timeframes and 

processes for PDZSTA-KB implementation and management in general, and for fulfilling the 

effectiveness conditions; (ii) improving the quality of projects at entry by resorting to advance 

contracting for the preparation of bidding documents and management tools (Accounting and 

Financial Procedures Manual, Computerised Accounting and Financial Management System, 

and monitoring and evaluation before programme start-up; and (iii) capacity building for project 

management teams in procurement and financial management. It should also be noted that the 

age of the current portfolio operations has significantly reduced over the past few years, with 

the average age reducing from 5.5 years in 2011 to 2.7 years in 2017, and there were no problem 

(PP) or potentially problematic (PPP) operations in 2017.  

2.7.3 Therefore, the PDZSTA design has reflected the lessons learned from previous 

operations by drawing on PPIP 2018 to meet design and implementation criteria as specified in 

the Bank’s Presidential Directive No. 002/2015.

III. PROGRAMME FEASIBILITY 

Economic and Financial Performance 

3.1.1 The programme is designed to mainly generate direct benefits in terms of the 

processing of crops promoted and developed through private investments to establish agro-

industries, i.e. about 35 units on Bancoumana agro-industrial park, for the programme period. 

In addition to the impact on private companies located in Bancoumana agro-industrial park, 

significant incomes will be generated by the beneficiaries of the agricultural sites also 

developed, from which companies will be supplied with the inputs already mentioned in Section 

2.2, namely: maize, shea butter, sesame, milk, rice, mango, groundnuts, livestock/meat, 



 

11 

 

tomatoes, poultry, and non-wood forest products such as honey, leaves, wild seeds and fruits, 

oils and resins, herbal tea, etc.). 

3.1.2 In addition to these benefits, the programme is designed to generate other benefits such 

as: (i) climate regulation functions by setting up a forest cover of 8.00 ha, thus creating the 

conditions for intelligent, and therefore sustainable agriculture; (ii) improving the well-being 

of populations by preventing drought and famine, improving food security, reducing the 

medical bill with the regulation of climatic conditions, reducing the hardship of women and 

vulnerable groups, improving people's life expectancy, better incomes to access health and 

education, etc.; (iii) improving all livestock and livestock production, due to the quality and 

abundance of pasture and water; (iv) improving the effects of carbon sequestration (carbon 

credit); and (v) the creation of temporary and permanent jobs, resulting from the programme's 

gains, resulting from the programme's estimated gains of 50 to 500 per processing unit (i.e. 

5,250, at the level of agribusiness units alone, for an average of 150 jobs per industrial unit) 

3.1.3 Financial Analysis: Many of the above impacts are not commercially tradable, or even 

tangible, and therefore do not lend themselves to financial performance analysis based on 

existing markets. In these circumstances, it was not considered appropriate to include them in 

a quantitative analysis based on production models or profit-making activities.  However, it was 

possible to carry out a benefit/cost analysis of agro-industrial business models and various 

agricultural production models (FARMOD). 

3.1.4 As regards agro-industrial enterprises, an assumption is proposed on the basis of three 

(3) types of processing units, namely small, medium and large enterprises with investments of 

USD 2 million, USD 5 million, and USD 11 million each respectively, in accordance with the 

average investment profile in such models.  Under these conditions, the annual turnover for 

each company will be USD 640,000, USD 1.6 million, and USD 3.52 million for the small, 

medium and large units respectively, as from the 5th year, over an operating period of about 20 

years. 

3.1.5 With respect to agricultural products of farmers who supply inputs to agro-industrial 

enterprises in the parks, FARMOD-type production models and benefit/cost models 

(Input/Output, With and Without Programme, over a 20-year operating period) have been used. 

3.1.6 Thus, the financial analysis gave: (i) a financial impact of more than XOF 53 billion 

per year from the 7th year of operation over 20 years, in line with operations of the same type, 

depending on the life of the investments. This implies that the financial impact of the 

programme over the operating period exceeds the cost of investments required to finance it; (ii) 

a benefit/cost ratio of 1.49, with the benefits higher than the investment costs; (iii) an internal 

rate of return of 25.21%, which is higher than the opportunity cost of the capital (cost of capital 

investments under the programme) estimated at 12%. In light of these results, it could be 

concluded that the programme has a profitability profile that financially justifies the cost of the 

programme's investments. 

3.1.7 Economic Analysis: The economic analysis was conducted using the benchmark price 

method, i.e. prices under conditions of economic efficiency, in accordance with the "Pareto" 

optimum. It was also based on a comparison between the "no programme" and "programme" 

situations of the production models presented in the financial analysis. In this model, tradable 

goods are goods that are likely to be commercially traded beyond the country (FOB in port and 

CIF in Marseille Port). Under these conditions, the benchmark prices of the products (economic 

prices) are evaluated on the basis of ex-ante equilibrium of the products, making it possible to 

obtain export parity prices at the borders of the programme (Export-parity price at Farmgate). 



 

12 

 

Labour was economically valued at 65% of its financial value of USD 3 per day, to take into 

account the inelasticity of labour demand in the country in general, and in the programme area 

in particular. 

3.1.8 On the basis of realistically defined assumptions, the programme's economic rate of 

return (ERR) was estimated at 26.07%, with a C/B ratio of 1.58. Consequently, the 

programme’s overall rate of return could be deemed satisfactory in light of the results. 

IRR (baseline scenario) : 25.21% Amount NPV:  XOF 201.572 billion 

ERR (baseline scenario) : 26.07% Amount NPV:  XOF 219.03 billion 

3.1.9 Sensitivity Analysis: Sensitivity tests conducted on the basis of production price 

reductions helped to measure the stability of financial and economic performance indicators. The 

tests show that prices need to be reduced to 39.17% (break-even point or "switching value") to 

cancel the additional benefits generated at the financial and economic levels, with IRRs and ERRs 

equivalent to the opportunity cost of capital, i.e. 12%. The tests also show that the programme’s 

cost-effectiveness profile is robust, although it was not conducted on all endogenous values of the 

model. However, the price variable is very important; it is the only factor that eludes programme 

management and therefore operation of the programme. The summary of the sensitivity analysis 

is presented in the Technical Annexes on page 72 of Volume II of this report. 

Environmental and Social Impact 

3.2.1 Categorisation: In accordance with the Bank's environmental and social safeguards 

policies and procedures, the Development Programme for the Special Agro-Industrial 

Processing Zone in Koulikoro and Semi-Urban Bamako (PDZSTA-KB) was classified in 

Category 2 on 22 August 2019, since the potential negative environmental and social impacts, 

as well as the related risks, are of low to medium level, and existing technologies for their 

management are easily accessible to the country. Indeed, the studies show that the type of agro-

industrial units that will be operated on the IAP are not likely to generate very heavy, toxic and 

dangerous polluting substances that are difficult to manage and may have irreversible effects. 

Furthermore, heavy industry farms will be excluded from the site. In addition, the 

characteristics of the site do not allow for fear of significant loss of biodiversity (savannah 

vegetation, very poor in wildlife, and no watercourses nearby); there will be no physical 

resettlement (the site is in an industrial zone according to the master plan of the host 

municipality), but very few economic displacements, according to the feasibility study. At this 

stage of the appraisal process, an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) 

was prepared for the programme and posted on the link: 

https://www.afdb.org/en/documents/mali-projet-de-renforcement-de-la-securite-alimentaire-

et-nutritionnelle-de-la-region-koulikoro-p-ml-aag-004-rapport-cges on Monday, 28 October 

2019. 

 

3.2.2 Required environmental and social assessments: The programme will be 

implemented on a site that is certainly known, but whose exact boundaries have not yet been 

determined. Therefore, in accordance with Mali's national legislation, an Environmental and 

Social Management Framework (ESMF/ESMFP) and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) 

are required. Of course, the ESMF, which will be used for the environmental and social review 

of the various sub-projects to be implemented under this operation, will provide the specific 

ESIAs/ESMPs required for the implementation of sub-projects, such as site development and 

establishment of agro-food processing infrastructure. It provides guidelines for the preparation 

of specific ESIAs/ESMPs. Similarly, the RPF, which defines guidelines for formulating a 

Substances Restoration and Improvement Programme, provides for a specific RAP for the 

https://www.afdb.org/en/documents/


 

13 

 

development works. In addition, it should be noted that the requirement for ESIAs and RAPs 

should be included in the contractors’ bidding documents. 

 

3.2.3 Programme Impacts: Potential Negative Impacts : During the works, the 

development activities of the agro-industrial park will mainly result in: (i) deforestation with 

the cutting of sparse woods such as néré (Parkia biglobosa), shea (Vitellaria paradoxa), zaban 

(Saba senegalensis), tamarin (Tamarindus indica), and (Cola cordifolia); (ii) disruption of 

economic activities with the destruction of farms, settlement on private land, incursion into 

private plots for quarries and borrowing pits; (ii) social tensions due to land problems with 

landowners and underutilisation of local labour; and (iii) involuntary economic resettlement. 

 

3.2.4 During the operational phase of the agro-industrial park (AIP), the operation of the 

agro-industrial units may generate fear of: (i) pollution of watercourses by direct discharges of 

liquid waste containing pollutant loads or scouring of rainwater causing pollutants to enter 

watercourses; (ii) air pollution by dust and odour discharges; (iii) reduction of soil fertility due 

to discharges containing chemicals and harmful substances; and (iv) accumulation of solid 

waste in the natural environment as a result of agricultural and industrial activity. 

 

3.2.5 Finally, the potential negative impacts will be as follows: (i) discharge of untreated 

and stagnant wastewater into the vicinity of the AIP may cause diseases such as malaria and 

bilharzia; (ii) the presence of foreign labourers may increase the risk of the spread of 

STI/HIV/AIDS; and (iii) the risk of uncontrolled influx of people seeking employment in the 

AIP, which may increase the risk of insecurity in the area. 

3.2.6 Potential Positive Impacts: The positive impacts of this agropole programme mainly 

concern the human and socio-economic environments. The major positive impacts of the 

agropole lie in the programme objectives, which consist in promoting the agricultural sector in 

semi-urban Bamako and developing the region's agricultural production to contribute to food 

and nutrition security and combat poverty and vulnerability. The positive impacts include: (i) 

reinforcement of transformative structures to bring water over long distances and thereby 

increase the value of land not yet used, given the scarcity of land. This will generate new 

activities and contribute to job creation; (ii) modernisation of family farms for market-oriented 

production; (iii) intensification, diversification and creation of inter-sector synergies in 

agricultural production basins for the promotion of agricultural enterprises to develop an 

agropole connected to sub-regional, regional, national and international markets; (iv) broader 

access to agricultural investment opportunities; (v) increased wealth for all stakeholders and 

links in the value chain (farmers, processors, etc.); (vi) reduction in post-harvest losses; (vii) 

reduced production shortfalls; (viii) broadening of the range of products; (ix) improved 

marketing conditions; (x) value-added for products through processing; (xi) significant 

contribution to restoration of optimal conditions to boost agricultural production (plant and 

animal) in semi-urban Bamako, as well as increase it on a sustainable basis; and (xii) efficient 

management of plant and animal production in the various production areas in semi-urban 

Bamako. 

3.2.1 Mitigation Measures: Measures that could be recommended by the ESMFP to mitigate, 

minimise or eliminate the negative impacts include: 

At environmental level: 

(i) Compensatory reforestation will be undertaken under the supervision of forestry 

services during the deforestation works, with particularly the same wood species, 

some of which have been obtained through scientific research that has had 



 

14 

 

spectacular results in reducing the adolescent age of the species (e.g. shea tree 

which can now start producing as from the 7th year). The reforestation will take 

place in the agropole, borrowing pits, quarries and village forests bordering on 

the agropole. 

(ii)  The AIP will have a wastewater treatment plant for all processing units before 

discharge into a developed site for its reuse. In addition, each processing unit 

will have a mini individual wastewater treatment plant before transfer to the site's 

large wastewater treatment plant. Since the groundwater in the area is of 

particularly high quality, measures will also be taken to protect it through proper 

management of AIP industrial wastewater, as well as prohibition of any activity 

that causes pollution around boreholes intended for human consumption. 

(iii)  With regard to solid waste, the AIP will have a transit dump for solid waste, 

which will subsequently be transferred to a final landfill site provided for in the 

development plan of Bancoumana municipality in which the AIP is located. In 

addition, efforts will be made to establish units for processing by-products of 

slaughtered cattle, sheep and poultry so as to reduce solid waste and landfill only 

the final waste. Furthermore, industrial units that cause heavy pollution will not 

be allowed in the AIP. All selected companies will also be required to undergo 

ESIA/ESMP assessments prior to establishment. 

(iv)  At the social level, economic assets and potentially affected persons will be 

identified and assessed in a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and the persons 

concerned will be compensated.  

3.2.8 ESMF Cost: The ESMFP cost is estimated at XOF 650 million and comprises: (i) 

preparation and implementation of specific ESIA/ESMPs; (ii) preparation and implementation 

of RAPs; (iii) capacity building; (iv) training of all key stakeholders of the programme's major 

sectors; (v) information and sensitisation of the local population and associations; (vi) 

environmental and social surveillance; (vii) environmental and social monitoring; (viii) mid-

term assessment of environmental and social performance; and (ix) pre-closing audit of 

environmental and social performance. 

3.2.9 Climate Change: Located at the gateway to the Sahel, Mali is highly exposed to 

climate change. According to climate projections for the Sahel zone, temperatures will continue 

to increase throughout the country as in other Sahel countries. The rise in temperature will be 

accompanied by changes in the distribution and amount of rainfall. Forest resources are among 

the most vulnerable to climate change due to the impacts of human activities on forest 

ecosystems (carbonisation, excessive logging, transhumant stockbreeding, land clearing 

for agriculture, mining, uncontrolled harvesting, etc.). 

3.2.10 As regards greenhouse gas emissions, Mali remains a very low-emitting country, with 

per capita GHG emissions of 2.1 tCO2 per capita in 1994 and a share in global emissions of 

less than 0.1%. However, the emissions have been increasing quite rapidly. Between 1994 and 

2015, they increased by a factor of 21.5, representing an average annual growth rate of nearly 

10%, or doubling every 7.2 years or so. Mali's objective is to reduce its greenhouse gas 

emissions by 13% by 2030, compared to the 1994 levels. In the forestry sector, this commitment 

focuses on stabilising mangrove surface area by 2030, reforesting 10,000 ha per year, and 

preserving classified forests and protected areas. 

3.2.11 Gender: The project targets women as a priority beneficiary group. Several project 

activities will have a positive impact on women in terms of: (i) reducing labour hardship and 



 

15 

 

wasted time, with the availability of nearby fuelwood and introduction of improved stoves; (ii) 

management capacity building through training, sensitisation and education of women; and (iii) 

improving health status through community health centres and other basic services (schools, 

primary health centres, and rural roads). In addition, the promotion of agricultural value chains 

will offer new opportunities, particularly in market gardening and non-timber forest products 

(shea, néré, honey and many other wild fruits and vegetables) that women can process, and 

thereby increase their incomes and improve their living conditions. 

3.2.12 Women play a key role in the agricultural economy and are found throughout the entire 

agricultural value chain: production, processing and marketing. However, despite women’s 

impact in the agricultural production chain, they still face many challenges, namely: 

• Access to resources and factors of production, particularly land, inputs, and 
fertilisers: due to customs and traditions, women generally do not own the land they 

cultivate;  

• Decision-making: Women are less influential in decision-making and conflict 

management in the agricultural sector; 

• Financial resources: Lack of resources is a serious problem in the agricultural 

and other sectors (education, health, etc.); 

• Training needs: Training remains a cause for concern, particularly as regards 

capacity building, entrepreneurship, management, etc. Here too, some women's 

literacy levels constitute a barrier. 

3.2.13 To meet these challenges, the Development Programme for Special Agro-industrial 

Processing Zones proposes activities to promote gender and empower women during its 

implementation, namely: (i) Entrepreneurship, job creation for women and young people, and 

access to markets through business incubators for young people (youth employability 

programme) and women (AFAWA); (ii) Increasing agricultural production and strengthening 

market access capacity through digitalisation of agriculture; (iii) regular and systematic 

consultations between the Government and private sector actors; (iv) promotion of domestic 

and local enterprises in agro-industrial parks; (v) support for SME financing through levies on 

other sectors, including mining; and (vi) sensitisation on behaviour change in family planning 

and reproductive health, balanced nutrition, gender and prevention of gender-based violence, 

prevention of early marriage, HIV/AIDS control, healthy living, and environmental sanitation.  

3.2.14 The programme is classified in Category 2, in accordance with the Gender 

Categorisation System. The detailed gender analysis and gender action plan are provided in the 

Technical Annex on gender. The budget allocated to gender promotion and women's 

empowerment activities stands at UA 0.88 million.  

Involuntary Resettlement 

3.3.1 Operational Safeguard 2 (OS 2): Involuntary resettlement: land acquisition, 

population displacement and compensation: The risk of physical displacement or resettlement 

of the population, as well as loss of major assets during programme implementation are 

minimal. However, land tenure and transhumance are major issues that need to be taken into 

account. In the event of physical displacement or resettlement of the population, Resettlement 

Action Plans (RAPs) will be prepared and implemented in accordance with Bank OS2 

procedures.

IV. IMPLEMENTATION  

Implementation Arrangements 

4.1.1 The programme will be managed by the Ministry of Agriculture (Project Owner), 

which will have a Project Management Unit (PMU) for the programme implementation. The 

PMU will be mainly responsible for coordination, infrastructure development, partnership with 

the private sector, financial management, procurement, and monitoring and evaluation of 

programme activities. It will comprise: (i) a Programme Coordinator; (ii) an Infrastructure 

Specialist; (iii) a Private Sector Specialist; (iv) a Procurement Specialist; (vi) a Monitoring and 

Evaluation Specialist; (vii) an Administrative and Financial Officer; (ix) an Accountant; and 

(x) support staff (drivers, secretaries, cashiers, and messengers). 

4.1.2 The PMU will also be supported by technical assistance (international and national 

consultants) on an ad hoc basis. It will also be supported in the field by partner organisations, 

particularly structures of the Administration, the Rural Economy Institute (IER), the Private 

Investment Promotion Agency (API Mali), Industrial Zone Planning and Management Agency 

(AZI-SA), National Directorate of Forestry and Water Resources (DNEF), Centre for The 

Development of the Food Sector (CDA-EPA), and Ministries and Technical Agencies to be 

involved in the programme. The signing of agreements with these partner structures, including 

IRD, will be part of the loan and grant conditions, under other conditions. Documents of these 

agreements should be prepared before programme implementation, to facilitate the “no-

objection opinion” process during implementation. 

 

4.1.3 A Programme Steering Committee (PSC) will also be established to provide strategic 

direction for the implementation of the program. It will be chaired by the Minister of 

Agriculture. The Committee will comprise the Ministers in charge of Economy and Finance, 

Agriculture, Industry and Trade, Investment and PPPs, as well as representatives of local 

authorities, the Chairperson of the Permanent Assembly of the Mali Chamber of Agriculture, the 

private sector, civil society, and the PMU. The PSC will meet at least twice every year to: (i) 

Review and approve the annual work programme and budget ((AWPB); (ii) validate the results 

of the program's performance, and (iii) frame innovations and ensure the relevance of the major 

choices to be made during implementation. The PMU will be secretariat of the PSC. 

4.1.4 It will be chaired by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Agriculture or his/her 

representative. In addition to the representatives of the ministries within the COS and the 

National Chamber of Agriculture, the PSC will include representatives of Local Authorities, 

the private sector, and civil society. PSC secretarial services will be provided by the 

representative of the Ministry of Industry and Trade. The PSC will be responsible for: (i) 

reviewing and approving the annual work programme (AWP) and budget, (ii) validating the 

results of the programme's performance, and (iii) monitoring innovations and ensuring the 

relevance of major choices to be made during programme implementation. It will meet at least 

twice every year. 

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements 

 

4.2.1 Procurement Arrangements: Procurement of goods (including non-consultant 

services), work and procurement of Bank-funded consulting services will be carried out in 

accordance with the Bank procurement Policy for Bank Group-funded operations ("AfDB 

Procurement Policy"), October 2015 edition and in accordance with the provisions of the 

Financing Agreement. In line with the implementation of that policy, and as a outcome of 

various assessment conducted, it was agreed that: 



 

17 

 

 

(i) Procurement of Goods and Works listed in paragraph B.5.2.1(a) of Technical Annex 
B.5 will be acquired in accordance with the country's procurement system ("Country 

System"); 

 

(ii) All other procurement financed by the Bank's resources and not mentioned in point (a) 
above will be made in accordance with the Bank's procurement system ("AfDB 

System"). 

 

4.2.2 The use of the National System for a group of transactions was considered appropriate 

because of a level of risk assessed as low for their procurement through the so-called system. 

Such a proposal has the advantage of improving efficiency in the implementation of the project 

through the following factors: (i) better ownership of the contracting system to be used by the 

enforcement agency; (ii) a time saving with the absence of a second control (after that of 

national entities) represented by the Bank's prior review. However, the Bank reserves the option 

of asking the borrower to return to the Bank System for the transactions concerned if: (a) Mali's 

legal procurement framework was changing to a system that was unsatisfactory for the Bank; 

(b) the PMU did not comply with by the requirements; (c) the special safeguards related to the 

use of the national system and described in Paragraph B.5.7.1 of the Technical Appendix were 

not used. 

 

4.2.3. Organization of the implementation of Procurement: The Ministry of Agriculture 

(MA) will be the Project Implementing Agency. The project's contracting will be implemented 

through a project management unit (PMU) that will be created and attached to the MA Cabinet. 

The experts of this CGP, including the contracting specialist, will be recruited on a competitive 

basis. 

 

4.2.4 Procurement Risk and Capacity Assessment (ERCA): In order to take into account 

the specifics of the programme, the Bank assessed: (i) risks at the national, sectoral and project 

levels; and (ii) the capabilities of the enforcement agency. The results of these evaluations 

concluded that there was a "substantial" level of risk for contracting and was used to guide the 

decision on the choice of the contracting system (Borrower, Bank,) used for specific activities 

and identified appropriate mitigation measures proposed at the level of the action plan in 

paragraph B.5.9 of Appendix B5. The resources needed to carry out these measures are already 

available or have been secured at the loan level. 

 

4.2.5 The Bank's resources to finance the project's activities come from the TSF and the ADF. 

As a result, the eligibility rules specific to the ADF window are those that will apply. Following 

the assessment of contracting risks and capabilities, it was decided to use the National 

Contracting System for part of this project. As the rules for eligibility for public contracts under 

Malian law are not the same as those of the ADF window, any practical incompatibility should 

be prevented. It was observed that Decree No. 2015-0604/P-RM of 25 September 2015, bearing 

the Code of Public Procurement and Public Service Delegations and its amendment to Decree 

No. 2016-0920/P-RM of 6 December 2016 Code of Markets and its implementing texts do not 

provide for any specific restrictions on participation in a Tender, except for the qualification 

and absence of sanction from the Public Procurement and Public Service Delegations 

Regulatory Authority (ARMDS-DSP), as stipulated Article 18 of Act No.08-023/ of 23 July 

2008 relating to the Public Procurement and Public Service Delegations Regulatory Authority. 

 

4.2.6 Consequently, the eligibility rules applicable for all contracts concluded under this 

project under the Malian public procurement system will be the national eligibility rules. 

However, in the case of the use of the national system, if the borrower's decision leads to 



 

18 

 

awarding a contract to an entity under the Bank's sanction or under United Nations Chapter VII 

sanction, the Bank's loan resources could not be used to finance such a contract. The list of 

companies under sanctions is available at http://www.afdb.org/debarred. 

 

4.2.7  Disbursement: The Bank's resources will be disbursed in accordance with its rules and 

procedures, in particular the disbursement manual. These will be done through the following 

three methods: (i) the special account method; (ii) the direct payments method; and (iii) the 

repayment method. As for the resources of the national counterparty, they will be disbursed in 

accordance with the national procedures in force. 

Financial Management  

4.1.1 Responsibility for the administrative, financial and accounting management of the 
Project will fall to the Ministry of Agriculture (MA), which will set up a Project Management 

Unit (PGC) whose members will be recruited, by call for applications and following the Bank's 

rules and procedures in this area. The PMC, consisting of at least (i) a Coordinator; (ii) an 

Infrastructure specialist; (iii) a private sector specialist; (iv) an Procurement Specialist; (v) a 

follow-up-assessment specialist; (vi) an Administrative and Financial Officer (RAF); (vii) an 

accountant; and (viii) a support staff (drivers, secretaries, cashier, courier), will have the tools 

of accounting and financial management, including accounting and financial management 

software, adapted to development projects and a manual of procedures administrative, 

accounting and financial matters. 

 

4.1.2 As a general principle, accounts will be kept on the basis of private commitment 
accounting and integrated software adapted to the management of development 

projects/programs. The accounting plan will be developed on the basis of the accounting law 

standards of the Uniform Act of the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law 

(OHADA) in Africa in Mali. In addition, PDZSTA-BK will produce an annual work program 

and budget (PTBA), as well as quarterly financial monitoring reports, based on the 

implementation of the PTBA, attached to the Bank's quarterly business reports, in which a clear 

analysis of the budget forecasts and the quarter's achievements must be clearly made. Any 

discrepancies will have to be analyzed and explained. 

 

4.1.3 Audit: Audit of project accounts will be carried out by an independent external audit 
firm. This firm must be recruited on the basis of terms of reference previously agreed with the 

Bank and according to its rules and procedures, no later than three months after the financing 

agreement comes into force. The audit contract will be three years non-renewable and the 

auditor will be required to file his report no later than six months after the end of the year 

audited. 

Monitoring 

Internal monitoring and evaluation will be conducted by the Programme's Monitoring-

Evaluation Unit, while external monitoring and evaluation will be conducted by the Ministry 

of Planning and the Ministry of Finance. External monitoring and evaluation aims to assess the 

effectiveness and efficiency of the programme's outputs and their contribution to the 

achievement of the programme's development outcomes, i.e. its effects and impacts. It will be 

conducted with the involvement of other stakeholders, in addition to the two annual supervision 

missions organised by the Bank. The mid-term review will be conducted in Year 3. At the end 

of the programme, the Bank and the Government will produce a completion report within the 

required timeframe. 

Governance  

4.5.1 The State Authorities’ efforts towards good governance over the past five years have 

been positive, particularly in procurement. However, the results of these efforts are not yet 



 

19 

 

visible, as Mali's Corruption Perception Index (CPI) still remains at an average of 32 out of 

100, compared to a regional average of 34, with a ranking of 182nd out of 188 countries in the 

2019 Human Development Index. Political, economic and social governance indicators for Mali 

are still a cause for concern, despite the progress made over the past few years. The indicators 

mainly concern poor performance in governance and the fight against corruption, as a result of 

repeated political crises that weaken State institutions responsible for regularly monitoring the 

governance system in Mali. 

4.5.2 In light of the foregoing, the PDZSTA-KB design provides for support for stakeholder 

capacity building at the institutional level, including reduction of governance risks through the 

programme implementation. The support includes the preparation and implementation of 

financial management and monitoring and evaluation tools, as well as the use of recognised 

transparency and competitive methods in the recruitment of PMU staff. Furthermore, support 

will also include the implementation of a system to reduce delays in the procurement process, 

which is one of the main reasons for shortcomings in the performance of the development 

programmes portfolio in Mali. Despite the alignment of the public procurement system with 

regional guidelines, support will also focus on operational procurement arrangements to address 

identified shortcomings. 

Sustainability 

4.6.1 The Development Programme for the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zone 

(PDZSTA-KB) was designed on the basis of a participatory approach, which was adopted 

following the SAPZ dialogue mission to Mali in March 2018 and used during all stages of the 

programme formulation, preparation and appraisal. The approach has made the population and 

Government aware of the economic importance of agricultural transformation through the 

processing of agricultural products (agro-industry) and technology innovations disseminated to 

farmers. In this regard, the capacity of key stakeholders in growth sectors will be adequately 

strengthened to guarantee regular supply of inputs based on a mechanism for long-term 

sustainability of jobs and incomes. The mechanism is expected to lead to the autonomy of this 

development model in which agro-industrial companies on the AIP operate with guaranteed 

supply of inputs and the Government is assured of revenue from corporate royalties and 

dividends generated by the Holding Company that will be established to manage the agro-

industrial park.  

4.6.2 The agro-industrial park management system will be formalised through a Holding 

Company with a clear legal status, including land ownership.  The agro-industrial park will be 

created and serviced, and subsequently placed under management in accordance with the 

current Investment Code and the special status of Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones 

(SAPZs). 

Risk Management 

4.7.1 The achievement of PDZSTA outcomes carries a number of risks for which mitigation 

solutions are required to ensure the success of the programme. In addition to the risks already 

identified for the entire portfolio, specific risks have been identified and mitigation measures 

proposed:  

 

 



 

20 

 

No. POTENTIAL RISKS MITIGATION MEASURES 

1 Lack of commitment from the supervisory 

authorities to support the coordination team and 

prevent delays in programme implementation 

The programme is one of the Government’s 

priorities, and its design was based on regular 

consultations with stakeholders, including 

representatives of the administration and 

municipalities concerned. 

2 Risk of low private sector engagement The programme’s design is based on consultations 

with the private sector whose concerns are taken 

into account in the final programme formulation, 

thereby guaranteeing SME involvement and 

ownership of the operation. 

3 Delays in engagement by some stakeholders 

could lead to delays in the programme 

implementation  

The programme is based on sensitisation and 

regular consultations for its gradual ownership by 

all stakeholders 

4 The programme is not being implemented in 

accordance with the proposed implementation 

plan and schedule, with delays in procurement 

A Procurement Expert will be recruited to assist in 

effective conduct of the procurement process. 

Knowledge Building 
 

4.8.1 The Development Programme for the Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zone 

(PDZSTA-KB) is designed to reflect the approach and principles of the flagship programme 

for Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones of the Bank's Feed Africa Strategy 2016-2022.  

This programme postulates that agricultural transformation will succeed if the private sector is 

involved in a leadership role, while the Government creates conditions for its implementation 

and success. To succeed, PDZSTA-KB was designed to develop knowledge on how to better 

work with the private sector, as a PPP, a non-sovereign operation (NSO), or a combination of 

both. Private sector involvement, along with public sector funding, is the primary knowledge 

that PDZSTA-KB will develop. 

4.8.2 The other knowledge generated by the programme implementation concerns: (i) the 

multi-sector approach, involving the intervention of sectors such as transport, energy, water and 

sanitation, agro-industry, agriculture, communication (NICT), education, health and nutrition, 

employment and trade.  In this regard, knowledge will be generated through pooling of efforts 

to rapidly produce agricultural transformation outcomes; (ii) the combination of: (a) two Bank 

Strategies, namely "Feed Africa" and “Skills Development”, especially for young people, and 

(b) at least four (4) flagship programmes, namely, Special Agro-Industrial Processing Zones 

(SAPZs), Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT), Agricultural Value 

Chains (AVC), and Post-Harvest Loss Reduction and Youth Employability (Enable Youth). 

The combination of strategies and programmes is the third level of knowledge generated by 

PDZSTA-KB; (iii) produce processing is a major development issue for which solutions will 

be sought in this programme; this is the fourth level of knowledge generated by this operation; 

(iv) employment in general, and in the agricultural sector in particular, as a solution proposed 

in the programme; this is the fifth level of knowledge likely to be generated by this proposal; 

and (v) contribution to reduction of massive agro-food imports from the continent and Mali, in 

particular; this is the sixth level of knowledge generated by PDZSTA-KB. 

4.8.3 Finally, the success of this programme will provide a body of knowledge that can be 

replicated in the development programme for all the country's twelve (12) agricultural 

development poles, including Koulikoro and semi-urban Bamako regions.

COUNTRY FRAGILITY SITUATION  
 

REPUBLIC OF MALI 

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME FOR THE SPECIAL AGRO-INDUSTRIAL PROCESSING ZONES (PDZSTA-KB)   

Fragility Factors Mainstreaming Matrix 
 

Fragility Factors Situation, challenges and resilience measures supported by the General State Policy with the support of Technical 

and Financial Partners (TFPs) 

Measures supported by AfDB intervention 

under PDZSTA-KB (2020-2025) 

Political inclusion Since independence, Mali has experienced four major rebellions. The rebellions have left Mali in perpetual political, 

humanitarian and social conflict. The most recent conflict, which occurred in 2012, is continuing today although the 

international community is continuously striving to find solutions to problems preventing Mali from achieving lasting 

peace. Indeed, Mali became a democratic country in 1990, but the democratic transition seemed to be just a sham 

because, after two decades of peaceful elections, the democratic process was no longer justified given that it was 

marred by corruption and political influence instead of engaging in organising really democratic elections. Such a 

turn eventually created a sense of unfair political representation for Malians. In addition, the laws passed on 

electoral districts portray the political leaders’ intention to exclude some minority groups from political influence. 

PDZSTA-KB activities will not have a direct 

impact on political inclusion, but community 

resilience created by the programme will 

bring a new perspective on representation 

and participation in the political process.  

Security Despite hopes for security, it must be said that complete elimination of insecurity remains illusory. While the 

Government, UNMISMA and the signatory parties have made efforts to stop the fighting for several months, jihadist 

fighters have become stronger, with more capacity for nuisance. Following a series of attacks, ambushes, mines, 

mortar fire and other attacks, they have made their way right to the capital. Even heavily armed foreign and Malian 

camps are attacked by the raging terrorists. Inter-community tensions with land disputes, cattle rustling and clashes 

have also resulted in several deaths and injuries, and demonstrate the fragility of the social fabric. It should be noted 

that delays in implementing the Algiers Agreement justify the reluctance of the population of some localities to 

reject jihadist rhetoric and continue refraining from cooperating in efforts to eliminate them. All these actions by 

Malian stakeholders and the international community do not augur well for the restoration and consolidation of 

peace and security throughout Mali. Security standards assess peace-building success by determining whether 

violence in total armed conflict has persisted in a country; they also consider the chances of a country with a history 

of intra-State conflict will experience it again. The standards give priority to the maintenance of internal peace and 

order, as well as prevention of civil conflict. With the long and frequent history of violence in Mali, it is likely that in 

its current stage the country will return to full armed conflict. 

PDZSTA-KB does not contribute directly to 

the security factor, but it does have activities 

for food security while mitigating some risks 

that could worsen the security situation. 

Justice Mali has a relatively structured judicial system with 1 Supreme Court, 3 Courts of Appeal, 16 Courts of First Instance, 

3 Commercial Courts, 3 Administrative Courts, 42 Extended Courts of Justice, 11 Labour Courts, 8 Juvenile Courts, 

and 3 Military Courts. However, despite this organisational structure, some of the courts are not operational, or 

when they are operational, they do not have adequate human resources in quantity and quality to meet the 

expectations of Malian citizens. Furthermore, despite efforts by public authorities to reform and increase the 

number of judges, the judge-to-inhabitant ratio remains well below international standards, with Mali having only 

PDZSTA-KB does not contribute directly to 

the justice system but addresses the issue of 

social and spatial inclusion, which is a source 

of social injustice, taking into account the 

vulnerable groups, particularly women and 

young people, in the project activities.

one judge per 7,000 inhabitants. Such shortage of staff, combined with their precarious working conditions, 

significantly help to make procedures more cumbersome and lengthy and, as a result, create mistrust among the 

population towards the institution. Malians' lack of trust and the judicial system’s restrictive access make it one of 

the institutions to which people resort as little as possible in the event of conflict. 

Economic and social 

inclusiveness 

Although the country has recovered, economic activity and natural resources are largely concentrated in the south 

of the country. Therefore, it is possible that the projected growth path may have only a minimal impact on the 

particularly troubled northern regions. Agriculture and industry account for 36.8% and 23.4% respectively in Mali's 

GDP. The main agricultural crops are cotton, millet and rice. Industrial production consists mainly of gold as a raw 

material. The growth of agriculture and gold mining industry sectors can only benefit the North if the Government 

reinvests its increasing revenue in these regions. The North should also benefit from the return of aid flows and the 

activities of international, humanitarian and non-governmental organisations. However, these two sources of 

secondary benefits do not directly address the main grievances of the northern populations: the lack of economic 

opportunities and the high unemployment rate. 

The various sectors selected for PDZSTA-KB, 

such as infrastructure development, youth 

employment and food security, have far-

reaching activities that are economically and 

socially inclusive.  

 Social Cohesion In addition to the issue of equity in access to economic resources and opportunities, the poor quality of public goods 

and services, particularly in justice, education, health and security, has been widely cited as one of the obstacles to 

peace in Mali. Indeed, structural deficiencies in health, education, security and justice services, which should be 

accessible to all and of acceptable quality throughout Mali, fuel people's deep feelings of inequality, particularly 

between the northern and southern regions, and between the regions and the capital, Bamako. Indeed, each of the 

regions feels that the others are more privileged in development financing by the Government and Technical and 

Financial Partners (TFPs), construction of infrastructure and, more generally, consolidation of the Government’s 

presence. The delivery of public services remains highly unequal and in short supply despite efforts made by the 

public authorities. These structural shortages are both in quality and quantity, with significant imbalances between 

urban and rural areas, as well as between Bamako and the rest of the country. Poverty indicator trends vary 

considerably across the regions, with progress in the West and South regions against persistence or even 

deterioration in the North. These inequalities were exacerbated by the 2011 food crisis, which negatively and 

disproportionately affected households. In the North, for example, there was a 41% increase in the proportion of 

people living in food-poor households as a result of the 2011 price and production shocks. Even though budget 

spending in the education and health sectors is in line with the averages of other WAMU countries, it remains very 

uneven and unfair: it does not benefit the most disadvantaged segments of the population. In addition, public 

spending on social safety nets to support the poor remains very low and is not always well targeted (a significant 

proportion of the resources do not reach the poorest households). 

The geographical location of PDZSTA-KB is a 

first step towards addressing the imbalance 

in the delivery of services between urban 

and rural areas.  As regards the programme 

activities, a number of the proposed 

components will help to establish public 

servitude required to ensure the successful 

socioeconomic integration of communities. 

External effects / 

regional ripple effects 

With the political and military crisis, Mali's capacity to diversify its economy fell to its lowest level as its exports fell 

from 13.9% to 1.9% between 2009 and 2017. However, this shortcoming is offset by Mali's strong capacity for 

regional integration and economic cooperation. Given this imbalance in terms of capacity, Mali continues to face 

enormous pressure from its geographical position in the Sahel-Saharan region. Regional and international diplomatic 

interference in Sahel’s political transformation seeks to advance their agenda at the expense of their neighbours. In 

addition to this external interference, there is also interference by jihadists - originally external since AQIM 

historically originated in Algeria - who are combining with a purely Sahelian jihad. Another external factor concerns 

the influence of market economic resources (control of cross-border traffic) which has triggered and is perpetuating 

PDZSTA-KB's support has no direct impact on 

external effects, but various interventions by 

the Bank and other TFPs are aimed at 

creating an environment conducive to the 

diversification of the Malian economy, more 

than 45% of whose export earnings come 

from the agricultural sector alone. To 

mitigate the effect of exogenous shocks,

the rebellion. Trafficking interests are the main source of rebel financing; they exacerbate inter-community relations 

and atomise armed groups. Far from being the preserve of the rebels alone, trafficking also causes competition with 

State actors. This makes the search for peace complicated.  

there are emergency social activities in areas 

with displaced people; this is a new 

opportunity to discourage young people 

from embarking on dangerous adventures 

such as terrorism and illegal immigration. 

Climatic/environmental 

impacts 

Although Mali has experienced accelerated deterioration of its environmental policy over two years (2015-2017) to 

the point where its score is below the African average, it has been able to strengthen its capacity in environmental 

protection to prepare for emergencies with Government resources allocated to natural disaster prevention and food 

price volatility. The humanitarian crisis has been a major challenge for peace-building in Mali because it is also 

environmental due to severe recurring drought that has made farming difficult and created a food crisis. The local 

economy, which is highly dependent on stockbreeding and agriculture, has forced Malian northerners to migrate to 

other countries where economic and living conditions could be better, but many of them have returned quickly due 

to the deteriorating situation in these other countries. In addition, UN reports in 2011 indicate that there are nearly 

200,000 displaced people in Mali, not to mention the more than 200,000 people who have fled Mali to countries 

such as Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Niger. Worse still, at least 4.6 million people in Mali have experienced severe 

food insecurity, which has prompted the UN to help mitigate the deterioration in living conditions. By 2013, the 

number of internally and externally displaced persons had increased significantly from about 410,000 to 475,000. 

PDZSTA-KB activities will implement the 

ESMFP measures recommended to avoid 

creating negative impacts on environmental 

protection.
