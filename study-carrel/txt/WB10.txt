B. Introduction and Context  
 
Country Context  
Benin is one of the world’s least-developed countries, with an annual per capita income of approximately US$830 in 
2017.  Poverty remains widespread, with a poverty rate of about 50 percent (US$1.90 a day poverty line – 2011 
purchasing power parity) in 2016. With an average per capita gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 1.4 percent 
(2007-2016) driven primarily by the services sector, poverty reduction has been limited, highlighting the need to ensure 
a broad-based and stronger growth. There are significant regional disparities in poverty rates and rural poverty rates 
are higher than those in urban areas. Fewer female-headed households fall below the national poverty line than male-
headed households. However, women continue to suffer from a lack of economic opportunity and are under-
represented in politics and in other high-level decision-making positions. 
 
The macroeconomic policy framework provides an adequate basis for the proposed operation. This assessment is 
affirmed by favorable medium-term growth prospects underpinned by continued strength in agricultural production 
and sustained investments. It is further strengthened by the Government commitment to meet the 2019 West African 
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) fiscal deficit target; and the participation to the WAEMU and the prudent 
monetary policy at the union level. The Government macroeconomic and fiscal framework is supported by an 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) External Credit Facility (ECF) supported program which aims to address Benin’s 
balance of payments needs, and alleviate the impediments to inclusive growth and poverty reduction by creating fiscal 
space for infrastructure investment and priority social spending.  While public debt has risen in recent years, the results 
of the external debt sustainability analysis (DSA) show that Benin’s debt dynamics are sustainable, facing a moderate 
risk of debt distress. 
 
The operation supports Benin’s efforts to strengthen fiscal management; increase agricultural productivity and 
strengthen the financial viability of the power sector; and improve equitable access to education and health services.  
The introduction of a Policy Based Guarantee (PBG) as a part of the second operation aims to improve debt 
management.

Relationship to CPF 
 
DPFs are a key instrument in the World Bank’s ongoing policy dialogue with the Government of Benin and its 
development partners. The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY13-17 (Report No. 75774-BJ) noted the importance 
of relying on a combination of development policy and investment operations in order to encourage a coherent 
approach to supporting structural reforms. The new Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for FY19-FY23 explicitly 
includes the current DPF series as a key IDA instrument for supporting Benin's structural transformation for 
competitiveness and productivity and notes that development policy operations (including the proposed operation) will 
target domestic revenue reforms designed to reduce Government reliance on revenues generated from imports 
informally re-exported to Nigeria.  Furthermore, the recently completed PLR, which extended the CPS for an additional 
year, and the forthcoming Country Partnership Framework (CPF 2018-2023) identified the need for new investments 
and reforms in agriculture as a priority – an area supported under this series. 
 
The success of Benin to attain the WBG twin goals in the coming years is highly dependent on its capacity to promote 
private sector development, which is the most efficient channel to create jobs and to reduce poverty. Achieving this 
goal will require an increase in the productivity of the agriculture sector and also require a regular and affordable supply 
of electricity, which is frequently noted as a leading constraint to private sector growth, particularly in the light 
manufacturing and agricultural processing sectors.  The DPF series aims at supporting the Government in its efforts by 
focusing on two main objectives. The first is to increase the productivity of the agricultural sector through a series of 
measures aimed at developing high value chains and improving the quality of agricultural products. The second 
objective is to strengthen the power sector financial viability and the reliability of electricity supply, which is consistently 
viewed as one of the key constraints by firms operating in Benin. 
 

 
C. Proposed Development Objective(s) 
 
The proposed operation supports Benin’s efforts to strengthen fiscal management; increase agricultural productivity 
and strengthen the financial viability of the power sector; and improve equitable access to education and health 
services. 

 
Key Results  
 
The measures supported by this DPF series are expected to strengthen fiscal management; increase agricultural 
productivity and strengthen the financial viability of the power sector; and improve equitable access to education and 
health services. The measures supported by the first pillar are expected to strengthen fiscal management by having a 
positive impact on tax compliance and revenue mobilization and by strengthening human resource management and 
promoting more efficient wage spending. The measures supported by the second pillar will have a short-term impact on 
technology for food processing, quality of agricultural products, and their market access; and a medium-term impact on 
the productivity of the agriculture sector. In addition, they will strengthen the country’s power sector financial viability by 
increasing the energy utility revenues and reducing arrears in the sector. Finally, the measures supported by the third 
pillar will are expected to improve access to education and health services in an equitable manner through a more effective 
deployment of newly recruited education and health personnel. 
 

D. Project Description

In the context of rising public debt, this series supports stronger fiscal management (Pillar 1) through measures to 
increase revenue and use public resources efficiently. In the run-up to the 2016 Presidential elections, uncontrolled 
increases in the wage bill and off-budget expenses led to significant increases in public debt (by almost 20 percent of 
GDP) and in the fiscal deficit (from 1.9 percent of GDP in 2014 to 8 percent in 2015, including grants).  The fiscal deficit 
was reduced from 8 percent of GDP in 2015 to 5.9 percent in 2017 by containing public spending. The DPF series 
supports the authorities’ efforts to strengthen fiscal management by improving revenue collection and by managing 
public expenditure more efficiently, particularly wages and transfers. 
 
Increasing agricultural productivity and value addition and strengthening the power sector’s financial viability (Pillar 
2) is a Government’s priority. Addressing the challenges of the agriculture and power sectors is key to promote private 
sector development, which is the most efficient way to create jobs and to reduce poverty. Agriculture employs about 
50 percent of the population and is the economy’s leading formal sector foreign exchange earner. The country has a 
large endowment of arable and fertile land and adequate water resources. However, Benin’s comparative advantage in 
agriculture remains largely unexploited. The sector’s productivity can be improved, once deficiencies in the agriculture 
policy framework and governance structure are addressed and constraints to farming, such as limited access to input 
and output markets and food safety and quality are tackled. As for the power sector, the inconsistent supply of 
electricity is noted as a leading constraint to private sector growth, particularly in the light manufacturing and 
agricultural processing sectors. Strengthening the financial viability of the power sector is essential to increase 
electricity production capacity in a fiscally sustainable manner.  
 
A new third pillar will support to the reforms necessary to improve access to education and health services. This pillar 
is consistent with the new national development strategy that emphasizes the need to strengthen the delivery of social 
services with. While access to education and health care has improved over the last decade, it varies considerably across 
income groups and locations. A key challenge is the disparity in the allocation of primary school teachers and key health 
care staff (doctors, nurses and midwives) across regions, with a relatively low number of them allocated in poor and 
marginal areas of the country.  
 
The introduction of a Policy Based Guarantee (PBG) as a part of the second operation aims to improve debt 
management. The PBG is expected to partially guarantee a Euro-denominated commercial loan extended by 
international commercial banks at more favorable terms than existing CFA-denominated short-term debt. The PBG 
would support the Government’s debt management strategy which aims at increasing the diversification of public 
borrowing and reducing refinancing risks by extending tenor. The Government has expressed its intention to use the 
proceeds of the commercial loan to prepay existing and more expensive short-term debt accumulated on the domestic 
and regional markets. This would reduce the Net Present Value of public debt and lead to reduced interest payments 
over time.

The Ministry of Economy and Finance is responsible for overall implementation of the proposed FRG series. The 
ministry’s Monitoring Unit for Economic and Financial Programs (Cellule de Suivi des Programmes Economiques et 
Financiers – CSPEF) leads the Government's technical team, with additional representatives from sector ministries 
participating as required. The Government has determined that the monitoring and evaluation of the DPF series and 
other externally financed budget-support operations will be based on performance indicators and targets set out in 
sector program budgets. Sector ministries collect data and transmit it to CSPEF, which analyses the data and produces 
periodic reports. This framework, which builds on the mechanism put in place for Benin’s PRSPs, supports the coordinated 
action and synergies between stakeholders involved in the monitoring and evaluation of the Government’s strategy and 
the provision of donor support. The donor community and the Government have agreed to an annual review process 
that includes quarterly review meetings, additional meetings on special subjects as needed, a mid-year progress review 
on the previous year’s aide memoire, individual sector reviews, a joint donor-government review mission and the 
preparation of a new aide memoire for the coming year. The World Bank is fully involved in this process, participating in 
and contributing to every element of it. 

 

F. Poverty and Social Impacts and Environmental Aspects 
 
Poverty and Social Impacts 
 

The FRG series is expected to have a positive impact on poverty reduction through different channels. Some of the 
measures supported will have a mostly indirect through stronger fiscal managemnet, improved public spending efficiency 
and productivity gains as well as job creation in the agricultural and no-farm sectors. This impact has been strengthened 
by the inclusion of the third pillar on human capital development that could have both a direct and indirect influence on 
the level and distribution of poverty.  
 
Prior Actions 1,2 and 3 support measures to strengthen fiscal management. These measures are expected to facilitate 
the delivery of essential public services and to contribute to a macroeconomic environment conducive to economic growth 
and private sector employment creation. Prior actions 4, 5, and 6 focus on increasing agricultural productivity and 
contribute to the Government’s poverty reduction goals. In 2015, 60 percent of the rural population lived below the 
US$1.90 per day poverty line. Limited agricultural growth (around 3.5 percent per year, which is approximately the rate 
of population growth in the country) has weakly contributed to poverty reduction. The development of value chains and 
diversifying production into more valuable crops should boost incomes of households involved in agriculture.  Prior actions 
supported in the power sector pillar (Prior actions 7 and 8) promote reliable access to electricity and a more cost-
effective electricity provision and should have a direct and positive impact on the poor. Only 29 percent of Benin’s 
households have access to electricity, and due to the significant disparities between urban and rural areas, only 6 percent 
of the rural population has access to electricity. The measures supported under this series will support the financial 
viability of the power sector. Furthermore, access to electricity liberates non-paid family time demands, particularly for 
women and girls, and further increases quality of life and opportunities for investment in human capital, including in girls 
and women. Increased and more reliable access at affordable prices should also have a significant impact on firm creation, 
firm growth and resultant employment opportunities, particularly in the higher productivity formal sector.  Prior action 9 
supports equitable access to education services and is expected to have indirect positive effects on poverty reduction. 
Schools quality play a determinant role in education outcomes. Improving school quality (through lower pupil to teacher 
ratios) is likely to improve learning outcomes and increase grade attainment. As education outcomes improve for the 
poor, they will have better job opportunities that offer higher earnings and security.  Prior action 10 supports equitable 
access to health services through the deployment of new health workers to underserved areas. Providing affordable 
health care service to the poor remains a challenge in Benin particularly in the rural areas.  Addressing health care needs

of the poor requires a multidimensional strategy integrating availability of health services, their quality, and financial 
accessibility.  
 
Environmental Aspects 
 

The reforms and policy actions supported by the proposed operation are not likely to have significant negative impacts 
on the country’s environment, forests and other natural resources. In addition, all the potential environmental and social 
adverse impacts associated with activities supported by the current DPF will rely on the existing National legal and 
regulatory framework and then, will be monitored and addressed through the national procedures in place in Benin.  Over 
the last 20 years, the Government has made significant strides in mainstreaming environmental sustainability in projects. 
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) is a legal requirement and it is widely applied to all developmental 
projects. Environmental assessment is a necessary condition to obtain the approval to implement any development 
project. It has been set up in Law N° 98-30 relating to the environmental framework and in Decree N° 2001-235 relating 
to the environmental assessment procedures. 
 
The prior action of strengthening the financial viability of the power sector is likely to produce climate change mitigation 
co-benefits since strengthening the financial viability of the sector is likely to promote the development of new energy 
efficient production capacities. In the agricultural sector, measures intended to diversify agriculture away from a reliance 
on cotton could have a potentially positive environmental effect as agriculture becomes less mono-culture based and 
increasingly diversified. 
 

G. Risks and Mitigation 

 
The overall risk level associated with this operation is substantial. Substantial governance, institutional capacity, and 
macroeconomic risks could adversely impact the PDO. Despite the substantial risk rating, staff believe that the potential 
benefits of the proposed operation outweigh the risks involved and warrant IDA’s assistance in proceeding with the 
operation and in implementing the critical reforms and policy actions supported by this operation, in coordination with 
other donors, along with appropriate risk mitigation actions.
