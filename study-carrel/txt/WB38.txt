I. Project Context
Country Context
Lebanon is an upper-middle-income country, with a population of 4.5 million people and a gross 
domestic product (GDP) of US$9,930 per capita in 2013.  The country is highly urbanized, with 
more than 85 percent of its population living in cities.  It has an open economy in which services 
and trade account for 60 percent of GDP and 73 percent of jobs.  The economy is driven by a 
dynamic private sector and is dependent on financial flows from Arab Gulf countries. The country 
is well-known for the high quality of its education system, ranking 13th out of 122 countries.   
 
The Lebanese economy expanded at a moderate pace (3.6 percent annually) during the past five 
decades. However, political instability, terrorism activities and the spillovers from regional conflicts 
made this growth erratic and unstable. Moreover, the ongoing conflict in Syria has resulted in a 
large inflow of refugees (estimated at 1.4 million  in January 2015), accounting for 30 percent of 
the country’s population. This complex political, social, and security environment put additional 
strain on the economy and public services. In fact, the GDP growth decreased from 8 percent in 
2010 to just 0.9 percent in 2013.   
 
Poverty affects nearly 28 percent of the Lebanese population (living on US$4 per day) and extreme 
poverty touches 8 percent (living on US$2.4 per day).  The highest concentration of poor is found 
in the North, followed by the South and the Beqaa. In addition, most refugees are concentrated in 
the already impoverished area of the Beqaa (35 percent) and North Lebanon (35 percent). The 
Syrian crisis is expected to have increased poverty among 170,000 Lebanese by 2014, with the 
existing poor becoming even poorer.  In light of these challenges, job creation and social protection 
are among the main development priorities in the country.  
 
Lebanon made considerable progress in shaping the legal and institutional framework and restoring 
infrastructure after the civil war (1975-89) and the more recent war with Israel (2006). However, 
the country is still at an early stage of transition to environmental sustainability. The cost of 
environmental degradation in Lebanon has been estimated at 3.2 percent of the country’s GDP in 
2005.  Water pollution stands out as the country’s major environmental problem, costing more than 
1 percent of the GDP per year. This accounts for the damages caused by the discharge of untreated 
sewage, industrial effluent, and agricultural runoff into valleys, rivers, and the Mediterranean Sea.

  

Sectoral and institutional Context
THE LITANI RIVER AND LAKE QARAOUN 
 
The Litani River is the principal artery of Lebanon. Rising from the Olleiq springs close to the city 
of Baalbeck, it flows 170 km through the Beqaa valley and the Qaraoun Lake, before it reaches the 
Mediterranean Sea. The upper Litani River catchment extends over an area of 1,500 km2 (10 
percent of the Lebanese territory) and comprises 99 towns distributed into 4 administrative districts: 
Baalbeck, Zahlé, West Beqaa, and Rachayya. The major water structure along the Litani River is 
the Qaraoun Dam, which forms the Qaraoun Lake (or resevoir).  
 
POLLUTION OF WATER RESOURCES  
 
Large stretches of the Litani River and of the Qaraoun Lake are polluted due to four sources of 
pollution.   
• Municipal wastewater. In 2013, the volume of wastewater generated in the Beqaa was 
estimated at 63 million m3 with an annual load of 21,300 tons of Biochemical Oxygen Demand 
(BOD). Most wastewater is currently discharged untreated into the Litani River.  
• Industrial wastewater. This is estimated at about 4 million m3 in the Beqaa. There are 
factories producing effluents that are conveyed to surface water through nearby tributaries. Out of 
294 industrial establishments in the region, 120 are large-scale industries located within 400 m of 
the Litani River, its tributaries, or the Qaraoun Lake. 
• Municipal solid waste. Waste generated in the upper catchment of the Qaraoun Lake is 
estimated at 650 tons per day. Because of the lack of sanitary landfills, most garbage is dumped in 
open dumps and in the Litani River along the Qaraoun catchment. Water pollution comes from 
littering and surface water runoff of solid waste. This is acute when the waste site is close to surface 
water streams. The main dump sites exerting pressure on the Litani River are Temnin El Tahta, 
Saadnayel old dump, Qabb Elias, Barr Elias, Hawch El Harimi, El Khiyara, Ghazzé, and Jeb 
Jennine.  
• Agriculture. The largest use of land in the Litani River basin is for agriculture. In 2010, 
irrigated agriculture in the Beqaa covered about 54,000 ha, primarily concentrated in three districts: 
Baalbeck (24,000 ha); Zahlé (16,000 ha); and West Beqaa (10,000 ha). Vegetables, fruit trees, and 
industrial crops are the main irrigated crops in these areas.  Agricultural water pollution originates 



mainly from irrigation overflows and seepage. A field survey conducted in 2010  concluded that 
farmers in Beqaa are over-fertilizing their crops and many pesticides are being applied at almost 
twice the recommended rates. As a result, agricultural chemicals and non-degradable pesticides end 
up in waterways with irrigation overflows.  
 
BUSINESS PLAN TO COMBAT POLLUTION IN LAKE QARAOUN   
 
The Ministry of Environment (MoE) commissioned in 2010 a Business Plan to help the government 
of Lebanon (GoL) identify the major sources of pollution in the Qaraoun Lake and to recommend 
appropriate solutions to mitigate them (detailed information is provided in annex 2). The Business 
Plan was completed in 2011 and endorsed by the Presidency of the Council of Ministers in 2012. 
The plan includes detailed prioritized investments for each polluting sector, with a financing 
requirement estimated at about US$255 million. In February 2013, the GoL requested World Bank 
assistance to fund priority activities of the Business Plan. 
 
The Business Plan identifies the largest two pressures as agriculture and municipal wastewater. 
Action on agriculture sources of pollution is needed to improve the overall surface water while 
continuing to contribute to the agriculture sector, a key sector, in the Bekaa. On municipal 
wastewater priority actions identified relate to continue to increase the volume of wastewater 
treated in Zahle, Iaat, Temninm El Tahta, Anjar, Jeb Jannine where the population and economic 
activity are most dense. 
 
INSITUTIONAL CONTEXT  
 
The Ministry of Environment. The MoE is empowered to study, propose, and implement national 
environmental policies. It is considered the only regulatory environmental agency in the country. 
The MoE is primarily responsible for environmental policy planning; setting laws, regulations, and 
environmental standards; imposing the application of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 
on development projects; monitoring environmental quality; and identifying permitting conditions 
for new industry, agriculture, quarrying, and mining. In relation to the proposed project, the MoE is 
responsible for regulating the collection and disposal of solid waste. 
 
The Ministry of Energy and Water (MoEW) is responsible for the strategic planning and 
management of water resources. Prior to 2000, there were 21 regional water utilities. Water Law 
221 of year 2000 and its amendments merged them into four Water and Wastewater Establishments 
and one pre-existing river authority: North Lebanon, Beirut/Mount Lebanon, Beqaa, South 
Lebanon, and the Litani River Authority (LRA). This was a major step towards consolidating the 
responsibility of these establishmen ts and clarifying their mandate as public agencies empowering 
them to better manage water and wastewater services. The ultimate role of the water establishment 
is to have full administrative and financial autonomy over the service provision of water and 
wastewater services and irrigation. The Beqaa Water and Wastewater Establishment (BWE) is the 
one responsible for the project area. The BWE inherited distribution networks in poor conditions, 
with very high levels of illegal connections and very low collection rates from those legally 
connected. LRA is a public establishment under the MoEW is primarily responsible to (a) exploit 
hydro electrical power plants; (b) construct irrigation scheme, (c) conduct preliminary studies and 
construct dams, and (d) monitor the quality of the Litani River. 
 
The Ministry of Agriculture (MoA). The MoA has overall responsibility for the development of the 



agriculture sector. While the MoEW has the overall mandate for water resources, including 
irrigation, the MoA has the prime responsibility for irrigation at the farm level. Sustainable 
management and conservation of natural resources is considered an important pillar of the MoA’s 
strategy for 2010�2014. The strategy gives high priority to enhancing the efficient use of irrigation, 
expanding the use of treated wastewater for irrigation, and reducing water pollution from 
agricultural chemicals. The MoA is also responsible for the regulation of pesticide and fertilizer 
imports, marketing, and use, and it has launched a series of measures to enhance enforcement of 
these regulations and promote awareness about the proper use, handling, and disposal of pesticides. 
 
The Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR). The CDR, established through Decree 
no.5 of 1977 is responsible for preparing national development plans, implementing infrastructure 
project, and mobilizing external financing to lead the reconstruction and development of the 
country. The CDR is accountable to the Council of Ministers.  
 
The Qaraoun Committee. In June 2012, a committee was established  to study the pollution 
problems of the Litani River and Qaraoun Lake and to propose remedial measures. The committee 
included representation of all key stakeholders and was active in the preparation and review of the 
Business Plan for Combating Pollution of the Qaraoun Lake. Once the Business Plan and 
subsequent roadmap were agreed upon, the study committee was dissolved. In May 2014, the 
Qaraoun Committee was established  to follow up on the implementation of the roadmap to combat 
pollution in Lake Qaraoun. The committee includes 16 members representing key stakeholders and 
has assigned the secretariat responsibility to the Litani River Authority.

II. Proposed Development Objectives
The development objectives of the project are to reduce the quantity of untreated municipal sewage 
discharged into the Litani river and to improve pollution management around Qaraoun Lake.

III. Project Description
Component Name
Component 1: Improve the collection of municipal sewage
Comments (optional)
This component will finance activities that increase sewerage collection in areas where wastewater 
treatment plants have been constructed (or planned to be constructed), to maximize the use of these 
investments. The criteria used for the selection of the investments on the expansion of the network 
are the following: (i) network for a currently underserved WWTP; and (ii) network for WWTP 
completed or expected to be completed within the project implementation period.

Component Name
Component 2. Promotion of good agricultural practices including integrated pest management to 
reduce agrochemical pollution in upper Litani basin
Comments (optional)
This component will promote adoption of sustainable production systems among farmers in the 
upper Litani basin, by introducing selected IPM (for example, reduced pesticides application) and 
GAP (for example, reduced fertilizer application and other conservation practices). These practices 
are expected to provide increased quality of agricultural products (without reducing yields); farmers’ 
savings (through decreased cost of production); and reduced pollution of the Litani River.

Component Name



Component 3. Technical Studies in Solid Waste, Water Quality Monitoring, Capacity Building and 
Project ManagementComments (optional)
This component will fund technical, environmental and social studies in solid waste. It will 
strengthen LRA capacity in water quality and water resources modeling and fund awareness /clean 
up campaign around the Litan river. It will improve BWE capacity in the supervision of wastewater 
infrastructure, the improvement in water fee collection and financial administration.

V. Implementation
The Qaraoun Committee -formally established by COM decision 32 of May 2014—already includes 
a representative from each institution involved in pollution management along the Qaraoun.  The 
committee will have an oversight role in the implementation of the proposedproject. Its main role is 
to ensure coherence and consistency between the proposed project and all other ongoing and 
planned investment in the upper Litani watershed area.  
 
Given the multisectoral aspects of the project, the CDR will be the implementing agency. CDR has 
wide experience with Bank operations, and is familiar with fiduciary and safeguards aspects. A 
Project Management Unit (PMU) will be headed by a project coordinator under the CDR’s 
responsibility. The PMU will be responsible for contract management, fiduciary and safeguards 
oversight, auditing, monitoring and reporting, coordination, and so on. Line ministries will be 
associated in the preparation and implementation of the project from the onset. As such, technical 
experts will be recruited by the CDR as part of the PMU but will be assigned to the line ministries/
agencies and will report to the PMU project coordinator at the CDR and their respective sectors. 
This arrangement will facilitate and bridge the gap between the CDR and the line ministries. It will 
also contribute to raising capacity in the different sectors involved.
