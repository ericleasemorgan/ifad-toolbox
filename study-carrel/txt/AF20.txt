PROJECT SUMMARY 

 

Project Overview: The Savannah Zone Agricultural Productivity Improvement Project 

(SAZAPIP) aims at transforming agricultural value chains for food and nutrition security, job 

and wealth creation in the Northern Savannah Zone of Ghana. The project will increase farmers’ 

food and nutrition security and incomes through increased agricultural productivity and 

diversification; and enhance the creation and strengthening of agribusinesses to increase 

incomes of actors along selected value chains on a sustainable basis. The project has four 

Components: (i) Crop Productivity Improvement; (ii) Value Chains & Agribusiness 

Development; (ii) Infrastructure Development; and (iii) Project Coordination, Management, 

Monitoring and Evaluation. The project will be implemented over a five-year period (2018 – 

2023) at a total cost of UA 40.38 million. 

 
Needs Assessment: The Savannah Zone holds major agricultural promise that when harnessed 

will transform the lives of the zone's inhabitants quite significantly, yet the zone constitutes the 

poorest part of the country with a poverty rate of over 40% which is about double the national 

average. The zone is characterized with relatively more challenging agro-ecological conditions, 

low socio-economic indicators and historical deficit in public investments in infrastructure and 

services. Development of this zone is perceived as a national imperative for Ghana’s balance 

of payments, macro-economic stability, economic growth, food and nutrition security, job 

creation and poverty reduction. 

 

Value Added for the African Development Bank: The proposed SAZAPIP will contribute 

towards the High 5 goals of the Bank Group. The project fits with the two key pillars of the 

draft Bank Group Country Strategy Paper (CSP) (2017-2021) for Ghana namely: (i) Agriculture 

Enhancing Inclusive Growth and Economic Development; and (ii) Support to Industrialization 

through Private Sector Development. The Bank Group has a comparative advantage in 

supporting the agriculture value chains development activities that will transform the 

impoverished rural areas of the northern part of the country into zones of economic prosperity 

drawing on lessons from experiences gained from previous projects financed by the Bank in 

Ghana. The project will also leverage on the complementary Ghana Incentive Based Risk 

Sharing for Agricultural Lending (GIRSAL) that is being established by the Bank in 

conjunction with the Bank of Ghana. It will also operationalise the activities of the TAAT 

framework and link up with TASI as a vehicle for attracting private sector investment in 

agriculture as well as the ongoing ENABLE Youth Program in the Bank funded Rural 

Enterprises Project (REP).  
 

Knowledge Management: Knowledge will be captured through the establishment of a 

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system by the project.  The M&E system will coordinate all 

results and measurement activities, ensure the quality control and provide the necessary 

capacity building. In using the performance indicators and targets specified in the results-based 

framework, special note would be taken of changes that reflect advancement towards the 

translation of outputs into development outcomes. Data for analysis will be captured from the 

M&E database, supervision missions, mid-term report, and periodic impact assessment and 

field exchange visits of the stakeholders. Knowledge will be generated by the pilot 

demonstration plots to form the basis for private sector investment in the agribusiness in the 

ecological zone as part of TASI. Knowledge could additionally be spread within the institution 

by showcasing the Project results using the Bank ICT infrastructure (Intranet, short 

documentaries on Bank website, etc.).

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF MANAGEMENT FOR THE PROPOSED 

ADF LOAN OF UA 27.86 MILLION TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA FOR THE 

FINANCING OF THE SAVANNAH ZONE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY 

IMPROVEMENT PROJECT  

 

Management submits the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of UA 27.86 

million to finance the Savannah Zone Agricultural Productivity Improvement Project in Ghana. 

I STRATEGIC THRUST & RATIONALE 

1.1.  Programme linkages with country strategy and objectives 

1.1.1 The Savannah Zone Agricultural Productivity Improvement Project (SAZAPIP) is 

designed within the context of the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda II” 

(GSGDA II). The underlying theme of the GSGDA II is socio-economic transformation, which 

involves a change in the structure and composition of the national output in ways that enhance 

broad-based, inclusive and sustainable growth. It stimulates the innovative process of 

production through skills and technological upgrading; enhancing the competitiveness of 

industry and trade; lifting workers from low-productive agriculture to higher productive 

activities; and putting the economy on a growth path that creates jobs, opens up decent work 

opportunities for all, alleviates poverty and reduces income and social inequalities.  

1.1.2 It is guided by country’s Food and Agriculture Sector Development Policy 

(FASDEP) which has the following as its pillars: (i) Food Security and Emergency 

Preparedness; (ii) Increased Growth in Incomes and Reduced Income Variability; (iii) Increased 

Competitiveness and Enhanced Integration into Domestic and International Markets;  (iv) 

Sustainable Management of Land and Environment; (v) Science and Technology Applied in 

Food and Agriculture Development; and (vi) Improved Institutional Coordination. The 

FASDEP anchors on sub-sector policies including the Crop Development Policy; Cocoa 

Strategy; Livestock Development Policy; Fisheries Policy and Policies for Services Delivery 

(Extension. Irrigation, Plant Protection, Agricultural Mechanization). 

1.1.3 The Government has targeted enhancing agricultural productivity and production 

through its Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ) Campaign. The major interventions under the 

PFJ are organized around the following five pillars: (i) Seed: The program will catalyse market-

led production of adequate quantities of quality seeds by private enterprises; (ii) Fertilizer: 

Private companies engaged in fertilizer production/blending and importation will be facilitated 

in meeting the fertilizer demands of the beneficiary farmers; (iii) Extension Services: In 

partnerships with the local governments and private inputs and service providers, the extension 

services will provide reliable and programmed technical assistance to beneficiaries; (iv) 

Marketing: It is envisaged that the facilitation of increased uptake of inputs will lead to 

increase in production of the targeted crops by the provision of storage warehouses; and (v) E-

Agriculture: The PFJ Campaign will profile the beneficiaries by e-registering them and 

developing a state-of-art information and communication technology (ICT) platform. 

1.1.4 While the PFJ Campaign is a nationwide program, the SAZAPIP will focus on three of 

the six agri-business clusters of the Northern Savannah Ecological Zone (NSEZ). The NSEZ 

constitutes the poorest part of the country with a poverty rate of over 40% which is about double 

the national average. The zone is characterized with relatively more challenging agro-ecological 

conditions, low socio-economic indicators and historical deficit in public investments in 

infrastructure and services. Development of this zone is perceived as a national imperative for 



 

2 

Ghana’s balance of payments, macro-economic stability, economic growth, food and nutrition 

security, job creation and poverty reduction.  

 

1.1.5 The Project is anchored in the PFJ Campaign of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture 

as well as the One District One Factory (1D1F) initiative of the Government of Ghana. The PFJ 

Campaign seeks to enhance agricultural production while the 1D1F looks at agro-industrial 

development aspects of the project. The Project will target four (i, ii, iv and v) of the above 

mentioned pillars and thereby contribute to the High-5 priorities that are crucial for accelerating 

Africa’s economic transformation: Feed Africa; Industrialize Africa; and Improve the quality 

of life for the people of Africa. It will particularly contribute to the Feed Africa priority which 

focuses on transformation, scaling up agriculture as a business through value addition, led by 

the private sector and enabled by the Government. It will concentrate on one of the eight 

identified Priority Intervention Areas (PIA) under TAAT - Transforming African Savannahs into 

breadbaskets and promote four of the 18 identified priority commodity value chains – rice, 

maize, soybean and vegetables. In line with the Feed Africa Strategy’s focus on priority value 

chains, the project will contribute towards the Transformation of the African Savannah 

Initiative (TASI) by serving as a precursor pilot project for proven technologies and knowledge. 

Details of TASI are in Section C6 of the Technical Annexes.  

 

1.1.6 The Bank has a comparative advantage in supporting the agriculture value chains 

development activities that will transform the impoverished rural areas of the northern part of 

the country into zones of economic prosperity with attendant benefits of employment and social 

development. This Project will achieve this by creating strategic, competitive agribusinesses 

around rice, maize, soybean and vegetable value chains that are widely produced in the northern 

parts of the country. The Project will consolidate the gains made through various previous Bank 

interventions such as the Northern Rural Growth Programme (NRGP), Fufulso-Sawla and 

Techiman - Kintampo Roads Project; optimise on the usage of infrastructure that were 

constructed in those interventions; and leverage on private sector investment to the 

establishment of a rice processing zone around Tamale and commercial farming in the Northern 

Savanna – the RMG projects in Yagaba and Babato.  

 

1.1.7 SAZAPIP is aligned to 2012-2017 Ghana Country Strategy Paper (CSP) which has been 

extended to December 2018. The strategy has two pillars namely: (i) Support for infrastructure 

development; and (ii) Support for improved governance and accountability. During the CSP 

extension period, the Bank will focus on developing and supporting priority skills for industry, 

improving access to sanitation and providing diverse opportunities for rural employment and 

income generation for a more equitable growth. Over the CSP extension period, the Bank will 

meet this objective through the implementation of the Development of Skills for Industry 

Project, and the Greater Accra Sustainable Sanitation and Livelihoods Improvement Project. 

Other projects that are envisaged to support this objective include: the Savannah Zone 

Agriculture Productivity Improvement Project and the Establishment of Ghana Incentive-Based 

Risk Sharing for Agriculture Lending.  

1.2.  Rationale for Bank’s involvement 

1.2.1 The project has a great potential in contributing to the twin objectives of the Bank’s 10-

Year Strategy (TYS). It contributes to inclusive growth across geographical locations, age and 

gender in that the major interventions of the project are concentrated in commodity value chain 

intervention in the NSEZ where poverty is highest in the country and youth and women agri-

preneurs are targeted by the project.

1.2.2 The project will enhance agriculture transformation through increased productivity of 

rice, maize, soybean and vegetables; and investment in both hard infrastructure (seed processing 

and storage, irrigation, produce warehouses and feeder roads); as well as soft infrastructure 

(farmer e-registration and e-agriculture). The project will also leverage on the complementary 

innovative agricultural financing mechanisms (the Ghana Incentive Based Risk Sharing for 

Agricultural Lending (GIRSAL) that is being established with the assistance of the Bank in 

conjunction with the Bank of Ghana. It will also operationalise the activities of the TAAT 

framework and link up with TASI as a vehicle for attracting private sector investment in 

agriculture in the savannah zone of Ghana. Furthermore, the project will provide 

entrepreneurship and business management training to value chain actors in order for them to 

be eligible to assess resources in the ongoing ENABLE Youth Program in the Bank funded 

Rural Enterprises Project (REP).  

1.3. Donors’ coordination 

1.3.1 The key development partners that are active in the sector are: L'Agence française de 

développement (AFD); Department for International Development (DFID); Global Affairs 

Canada; European Union; German Dev. Co-op (KfW Development Bank and GiZ); 

Netherlands Embassy; Australian High Commission; JICA; USAID and World Bank; UN 

Agencies (IFAD, FAO and WFP). Others are IFPRI, AGRA and international NGOs such as 

SNV and Catholic Relief Services. Donor activities cuts across ranges mostly targets various 

commodity value chains development, productivity enhancement, agricultural production and 

processing infrastructure development, mechanization, irrigation, sustainable land 

management, climate change adaptation and mitigation, nutrition, food safety, MSE and 

agribusiness development, access to finance, access to land and ICT for agriculture.  

 

1.3.2 Donor coordination mechanisms for the Agriculture Sector in Ghana are effective. 

Coordination under the Agriculture Sector Working Group (ASWG) began in 2002 and 

provides a platform for sharing information on ongoing and planned future activities with the 

aim of harmonizing interventions. The group holds annual joint sector reviews where donors, 

Government, implementation partners, civil society organizations (CSOs), and the private 

sector review the performance of the sector to inform planning and decision making. The 

ASWG is an open group of donors; quasi donors; implementers including NGOs, CSOs, private 

sector, etc.; and Government Ministries.  

 

1.3.3 Key on-going/pipeline interventions by donors include a EUR160 million support for 

productive investment for sustainable agriculture development capacity building of 

decentralized institutions and community development in the part of the SADA Zone. The 

Government of Canada is also supporting the sector with a CAD125 million facility for 

Modernizing Agriculture in Ghana (MAG). IFAD has provided USD71.60 million as loan for 

sustainable rural poverty reduction in rural areas and a grant of USD10.0 million to mitigate 

the effects of climate change. The Bank has successfully co-financed projects in the sector with 

other donors. Notable among these is the just ended Northern Rural Growth Program and the 

on-going Rural Enterprises Program which were/are both co-financed with IFAD. A matrix of 

interventions by donors is presented in Annex A1 of the Technical Annexes. The coordination 

of aid through the ASWG is enhancing aid effectiveness through harmonization and alignment 

of development partner support.

II PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

2.1 Project Objectives 

2.1.1 Project development goal: The development objective of the project is to transform 

agricultural value chains for food and nutrition security, job and wealth creation.  

 

2.1.2 Specific project objectives: To increase farmers’ food and nutrition security and 

incomes through increased agricultural productivity and diversification; and enhance the 

creation and strengthening of agribusinesses to increase incomes of actors along selected value 

chains on a sustainable basis. 

 

Project Components 

 

2.1.3 The project will have four Components. (i) Crop Productivity Improvement; (ii) Value 

Chains & Agribusiness Development; (ii) Infrastructure Development; and (iii) Project 

Coordination, Management, Monitoring and Evaluation. The summary of activities are 

indicated in Table 2.1 below. 

 

Component 1 – Crop Productivity Improvement: This component will seek to increase the crop 

productivity through the use of improved and more nutritious seed varieties. The project will 

assist rice, maize, soybean and vegetable farmers to adopt productivity– improving 

technologies such as soil fertility interventions, mechanization, and extension services. 

Nutrition promotion activities will be implemented in order to promote dietary diversity, and 

in particular to increase consumption of vegetables in the project area. Infrastructure of the 

decrepit national seed production centers will be renovated, equipped with modern machinery 

and supported to ensure national self-sufficiency in breeder, foundation and certified seeds 

production for strategic commodities. Essential expected outcomes under this component will 

be disseminating technologies selected under the Technologies for African Agricultural 

Transformation (TAAT) for the target commodities. These technologies will be complemented 

by other proven technologies within the TASI framework. Demonstration of high gross margin 

crop production technology and conservation agriculture will also be carried out at four selected 

locations. Private and public sector extension agents, commercial farmers, and young farmers 

will also be trained in the new maize and soybean production technologies. 

 

Component 2: Value Chain and Agribusiness Development: The objective of this component 

is to set up sustainable agribusinesses along the commodity value chains by entrepreneurship 

training to value chain actors. It will further strengthen the local governance structures such as 

the District Value Chain Committees (DVCCs), which is an innovative concept that links 

farmers to value chain’s actors to more ably participate in the ownership and management of 

facilities that will be set up. It will orchestrate linkages to other flagship programmes of the 

Bank particularly the on-going ENABLE Youth Program in the Rural Enterprises Program and 

the up-coming Risk Sharing Facility (RSF) through Ghana Incentive Based Risk Sharing for 

Agricultural Lending (GIRSAL and facilitation of the establishment of an Innovation Platform.  

This component will ultimately contribute to the achievement of the Government flagship 

program of 1D1F as it will promote private sector investments in the Project operational area. 

 

Component 3:  The infrastructure development component will provide for both hard and soft 

infrastructure. The hard infrastructure will include: (i) Development of Transport Infrastructure 

(feeder roads, farm-tracks and stock routes); (ii) Rehabilitation of irrigation canals; (iii) 

Development of Processing & Marketing Infrastructure especially as corporate rural 



 

5 

enterprises; and (iv) Rehabilitation of warehouses. The soft infrastructure will leverage on on-

going e-agriculture activities in the sector to consolidate the various registration of farmers into 

an agriculture sector database for input supply system. 

 

Component 4: The Project Management and Co-ordination will be responsible for the day to 

day management of the project. It will also be responsible for Monitoring and Evaluation 

(M&E), gender equality and women’s empowerment and implementation of the Project 

Environmental and Social Management Plan.

Intervening in other 

value chains including 

livestock. 

Livestock is one of the key value chains that was identified 

in five of the six agribusiness zones. The per-capita 

consumption meat has almost doubled in past 15 years. 

The growth in meat production however lags far behind 

the growth in consumption of meat hence large volumes of 

imported meat.. Livestock development integrates well 

with crops development especially with crops such as 

soybean and maize which are used for livestock feed in 

semi-intensive and intensive production systems 

Budgetary allocation for 

the project cannot 

accommodate the livestock 

intervention. Furthermore, 

livestock is yet to be 

considered a priority 

commodity under the 

Planting for Food and Jobs.

2.4.4 Justification for Local Costs Financing: The ADF loan of UA 27.86 million will 

finance 100% of Works; 55% of Goods and Materials; 100% of Services; and 68% of recurrent 

costs. The loan will finance 67% of foreign costs and 72% of local costs. The Government of 

Ghana does not have the capacity to finance all local costs of the project as a result of the current 

economic hardship and fiscal deficit facing the country. Consequently, local costs have been 

factored into AfDB financing in order not to delay implementation of activities.   

2.5 Programme’s target area and population 

The Project will be implemented in three agribusiness zones (1, 2 & 5) defined by SADA 

covering the following towns: Savelugu-Nanton (Nasia/Nabogu); Builsa South 

(Fumbisi/Gbedembilisi); Tolon (Golinga); Kumbungu (Bontanga); West Gonja (Nabori, 

Busumu); and West Mamprusi (Walewale). Additionally, four seed centres at Winneba, Ho, 

Kumasi and Tamale would be rehabilitated. The direct beneficiaries are about 50,000 

economically active smallholders living in the selected agro-processing zones; and the 

processing firms that serve as a direct market for the farmers. The indirect beneficiaries include 

the entire population (consumers) that will benefit from the availability of food and business 

associations who provide services to the producers and processors. This number is expected to 

increase significantly when other economically active value chain entrepreneurs get involved 

in the Project. Among the target group, women and youth play a major role in crop production, 

processing, small enterprises operation and marketing. About 50% of beneficiaries (women) 

will be specifically targeted in project activities and to reap benefits. 

2.6 Participatory process for programme identification, design and implementation 

The preparation mission had a general consultation and technical working sessions with 

Government personnel and key stakeholder groups in agriculture including development 

partners. The outcome of the discussions was the development of a logical framework for the 

Project and the preparation report that is forming the basis for the appraisal report. Stakeholders 

will also be consulted during the preparation of the ESMF and site specific ESMPs and their 

inputs will be taken into consideration during planning, design and implementation. A 

stakeholder engagement plan will be developed for the implementation phase of the project. 

2.7 Bank Group experience, lessons reflected in the programme design 

2.7.1 As at 30 December 2016, the overall performance of the Bank’s portfolio in Ghana was 

rated satisfactory, with an overall rating of 3.0 on a scale of 1 to 4, with 4 being highly 
satisfactory. The portfolio was rated 2.9 for implementation progress, and 3.4 for development 

outcome. The portfolio has six (6) project at risk, of which three projects (i) Rural Enterprise 

Programme III; (ii) Development of Skills for Industry (DSIP), and (iii) the Electricity 
Distribution Systems Reinforcement are experiencing slow implementation. The Greater Accra 

Sustainable Sanitation and Livelihoods Improvement Project experienced signature delays, 
which have now been surmounted with the signing of the loan in September 2017. The Ghana 



 

10 

Country Office (COGH) improved in most of the key performance indicators during the period 
2013 to 2017. Average time lapse between approval and first disbursement has reduced to an 

all-time low of 5.4 months compared to 18 months in 2015. The pace of implementation of the 
lending program and portfolio was adversely impacted by Government’s imposition of a 

moratorium on new loans, between 2013 and 2015, as part of its debt management strategy. 

This moratorium contributed to the drop in the disbursement ratio from 28% in 2015 to 18% in 
2016. Disbursement is now on the upward path, at 22.4% as at August 2017. Further details are 

provided in Annex B1.2 of the Technical annexes. 

 

2.7.2 The lessons learnt from the Bank’s operations in the country has enhanced project 

design for implementation efficiency and sustainability. For example the CSPE (2002-2015) 

indicated that the sustainability of agriculture sector projects was limited by project design 

flaws, particularly the lack of clear management plans for the maintenance of key assets such 

as pack houses and markets. This flaw has been addressed in this project by the new approaches 

which considers intervening to fill the gaps in the operations of actors along the value chains of 

interest as against the concentration of the activities supported by the program around just the 

farmers. The project designs also builds on lessons learnt form the NRGP in the areas of 

Appropriate exit strategy for project implementing support agencies; Readiness of project for 

implementation at design; and Matching grants. Specifically, based on the experiences of this 

project and others, APIP is designed to support existing government institutions such as the 

CSIR-SARI, SRI to strengthen their delivery of services that are under their mandate such as 

breeder and foundation seed production; and soil nutrient analysis as against using NGOs or 

private sector. It is also designed to leverage on private sector investment on the ground, such 

as existing AMSECs and AVNASH and catalyse their activities (e.g. mechanization and 

primary processing), without creating dependency of the project funds. APIP has already 

identified the major infrastructure for which feasibilities had already been done including 

rehabilitation works on the existing Golinga and Botanga Irrigation Schemes; improvement of 

water management infrastructure for selected flood recession schemes, rehabilitation of 12 

warehouses have all be identified. APIP is not introducing any one fit all matching grant 

program. It will leverage on the government’s own input and mechanization support program 

in which case mechanized service provides are able to acquire machinery / equipment from the 

government with a concessionary repayment arrangement including a grant element.  In the 

cases of non-existing technologies, particularly for mechanization such as using laser levellers, 

mouldboard plough, rice transplanters etc. the project will provide for full grants to the 

mechanization service providers to acquire the technology and promote them 

2.8 Key performance indicators 

The overall impact of the SAZAPIP include improved food and nutrition security, job creation 

and wealth creation for commodity value chain actors. Through improved agricultural 

production, productivity and market linkages, about 20,000 jobs will be created, of which 

women and youths account for about 60%, along the value chains. It is envisaged that there will 

be income increase by 25% along the value chains and employment of women and youth in the 

agriculture sector. The crowding in of private sector investment in terms of investment volume 

as a result of the demonstration of improved technologies and production systems will be a key 

indicator of success.

III PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1. Financial and economic performance 

3.1.1 A financial assessment of the project was undertaken using activity models, and on the 

basis of prevailing market prices. The key assumptions underlying the analyses include: (i) 

50,000 farmers being actively engaged in farming at full capacity of the project; (ii) additional 

25% increase in income will be earned under the project, (iii) farmers will adopt the improved 

seed varieties (iii) a 20-year time period was used to measure the incremental benefits from the 

project; (iv) the opportunity cost of capital (OCC) used for discounting future benefits was 

estimated to be 12%. For the economic analysis, (v) hired labour value was adjusted by a 

conversion factor of 0.75; (vi) the rehabilitation of the seed system will ensure national quality 

seed supply. These analyses were carried-out with financial and economic costs generated using 

Costab 32. Summary of financial and economic analysis is in Annex VII and further elaborated 

in Annex B6 in Volume II of the appraisal report. The project is expected generate the following 

benefits: (i) increase in food production; (ii) increased private sector investment; (iii) improved 

seed production and storage; (iv) improve average household income; (v) provide employment 

for 50,000 farmers and entrepreneurs; and (vi) enhanced crop nutrition. 

 

 Table 3.1: key economic and financial figures 
 

FIRR : 23%    NPV (base case) is USD   2,333,835.26   

EIRR : 28%    NPV (base case)  is USD  2,683,910.55      

   NB: detailed calculations are available in Annex B7 

 

3.1.2 Financial analysis 

 

Based on the above assumptions, the financial analysis generated Net Present Value (NPV) of 

USD2,333,835.26 and financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of 23%, as captured in the 

technical annexes (B6). Based on the above analysis, the project is deemed financially feasible. 

The FIRR of 23% is higher than the opportunity cost of capital (12%). 

 

3.1.4 Economic analysis 

 

The economic analysis was conducted using the same approach as the financial analysis, on the 

basis of shadow prices of tradable goods, producer (farm gate) prices and total cost of project. 

In addition, other indirect benefits were also expected, such as, reduction in post-harvest losses; 

provision of mechanic service centre for agro equipment, reliable soil information system for 

fertilizer blends, efficient input distribution system through the farmer database system and 

lower cost of transportation of goods and services. However, these additional benefits were 

difficult to adequately value in monetary terms due to the limited scope of this report. In these 

conditions, the economic analysis yielded an NPV of USD2,683,910.55 and the economic 

internal rate of return (EIRR) of 28% as captured in the technical annexes. 

3.2. Environmental and social impacts 

3.2.1 Environment  

 

3.2.1.1 The Ministry of Food and Agriculture, has made efforts to ensure sustainable land and 

environmental management within the sector through implementation of several policies and 

programmes and these include: Food and Agriculture Sector Development Policy (FASDEP II) 



 

12 

and an Agricultural Sustainable Land Management Strategy and Action Plan was developed to 

operationalize the policy objective. MoFA works in collaboration EPA at all levels to ensure 

that environmental sustainability policy and programmes are implemented. The proposed 

Savannah Zone Agricultural Productivity Improvement Project is classified as a Category 2 

because the project activities are expected to have impacts that can be avoided and minimised 

and will mostly be site-specific environmental and social impacts. The Project also falls under 

Schedule 2 of the Environmental Assessment Regulations 1999 LI 1652 of the Ghana 

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The project is expected to finance construction and 

rehabilitation of small irrigation schemes, processing, marketing and storage facilities as well 

as support activities for increased production and commercialization. The project’s precise 

location, scope and scale of the project interventions will not be known before project 

implementation; hence, an overarching environmental and social management framework 

(ESMF) needs to be developed to provide the framework for managing the environment and 

social risks/issues of the project. This will guide the preparation of environmental and social 

impact assessment (ESIA) and development of site specific ESMP during project 

implementation.  

 

3.2.1.2 The anticipated negative impacts are those associated with the construction and/or 

rehabilitation works and agricultural production and value-chain development activities and 

include:  (i) loss of vegetation cover and habitat fragmentation due to site clearing (ii) land 

degradation, soil erosion, and pollution (iii) degradation of water resources through siltation 

and pollution (iv) disruption of water flows and hydrologic cycle which may impact activities 

of other water users, (v) noise, vibration and emissions from construction works and operation 

of machinery that may impair air quality and induce health implications, (vi) increased use of 

agrochemicals including pesticides and fertilizers that may have impacts on human health and 

biodiversity (vii) solid and liquid wastes generated from processing and marketing facilities 

(viii) increase in bush fires through the slush and burn traditional agricultural systems; (ix) 

climate risk impacts of GHG emissions and cumulative impacts of flooding if infrastructure is 

not well designed (x) increase in public health concerns (vector borne diseases, HIV/AIDs and 

other STDs) due to creation of vector habitats such as stagnant waters and influx of workers in 

project site areas and increased land conflicts due to commercialization, most lands are 

customary. The project is not expected to have land acquisition because the infrastructure 

development will be done on existing irrigation schemes and feeder roads with existing right of 

way. During operation phase, agriculture activities of value chain actors may lead to (i) 

increased use of agrochemicals including pesticides and fertilizers, which may contribute to 

soil and water (surface and groundwater) contamination, and increase health-risks of people 

exposed to pesticides, (ii) maintenance of irrigation infrastructure can generate dredged 

materials and waste and effluents from processing and marketing facilities can result in soil and 

water contamination when not properly disposed of. These impacts are mostly site specific and 

can be readily managed with the application of well-defined measures elaborated in site-specific 

ESIAs/ESMPs such as (i) restricting clearance of vegetation to construction and farming areas 

and revegetation by planting of trees; (ii) rehabilitation and filling of the exposed or excavated 

soil soon after completion of works and avoiding or minimizing compaction of soils, (ii) 

ensuring environmental flow for rivers/lakes, (iii) establishing sustainable water management 

and flood mitigation systems, and (iv) reduction of GHG emissions by ensuring well serviced 

machinery is used and proper processing facilities waste management; (v) capacity building of 

value chain actors to promote good agriculture and sustainable environment and land 

management practices (vi) use of improved agriculture technologies such as integrated soil 

fertility management (ISFM), integrated pest management (IPM) and Waste-to Energy; (vii) 

using lessons learned from similar projects. In addition, the project will ensure that institutional 



 

13 

and technical capacity that currently exist within MoFA is strengthened by having an 

Environmental Safeguard specialist in the Program Management Unit and training of 

Environmental Desk Officers at the local level to ensure effective site specific ESMP 

development, implementation and monitoring/reporting.  

 

3.2.1.3 Ghana SAZAPIP will generate significant positive impacts including (i) improved 

production, and competitiveness of selected agriculture commodities that will contribute to 

increased income opportunities for value chain actors including vulnerable groups, and support 

the local economy of the northern regions of Ghana; (ii) improved access to irrigation that will 

foster water management and reduce the vulnerability of farmers to precarious weather 

conditions and ensure all year round agriculture activities; (iii) improved agronomic practices 

and technologies for selected crops and improved varieties that are adapted to different climatic 

conditions; and (iv) improved agricultural production, productivity and market linkages that 

will foster job creation along the value chains. 

  

3.2.2  Climate change 

 

3.2.2.1 Ghanaian agriculture and food systems are climate dependent and recognized as one of 

the most vulnerable sectors to climate change. Indications are that the Northern Region of 

Ghana is currently experiencing seasonal variability of climate and rainfall. Consultations with 

MoFA and EPA indicated that the region is susceptible to flooding and drought that are 

unpredictable. The current increase in rain intensity is aggravating flooding events causing 

riverbank erosion, saltwater intrusion, infrastructure damages, crop failure, fisheries 

destruction, and loss of biodiversity. This has significant implications on livelihoods of 

agricultural communities who are mostly dependent of rain fed agriculture. Recommendations 

were made to incorporate climate risk mitigation and management strategies in the project 

design. 

 

3.2.2.2 The project will mainstream climate risk mitigation and adaptation activities in the 

project design and implementation that will focus on reducing the dependency on rainfall for 

agricultural activities as well as protect ecosystems at risk from other natural or anthropogenic 

hazards that accompany floods, drought and other land use changes.  The program will explore 

climate change adaptation technologies for agriculture consistent with priorities established in 

Ghana’s National Adaptation Program for Action (NAPA), Climate Change Policy, and the 

MoFA’s National Climate Smart Agriculture and Food Security Action Plan (2016-2020). This 

will ensure that the project facilitates and promotes greater resilience and adaptation to climate 

change by promoting climate smart agriculture through use of improved agriculture 

technologies and conservation agriculture.  

 

3.2.3 Social Impact and Nutrition 

 

According to the most recent data in the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), 

the prevalence of stunting is significantly higher in the Northern Region, with 33% stunting in 

children under five as compared to the national prevalence of 19%. Also the prevalence of 

anaemia in children under five is very high (82.1%). The Project will contribute to increased 

dietary diversity among households, and especially among women and children, in the Northern 

and Upper East regions. The actions envisaged include: (i) community sensitization on good 

nutrition and hygiene practices, and enhanced management of acute malnutrition, through 

strengthening of the Community Health Workers system; (ii) equipment of health facilities with 

materials for anthropometric measurements where there is an identified need (based on 



 

14 

assessment by Ghana Health Services); (iii) linkage of small holder farmers to the Ghana School 

Feeding Programme and (iv) nutrition and hygiene education in schools, complemented by fruit 

tree planting and school gardens. To link the School Feeding Programme to the smallholder 

farmers benefiting from the project, agriculture extension officers will be involved, who will 

also be engaged in the school gardens and fruit tree planting. In order to accommodate all these 

activities, a total of UA3 million will be earmarked for the support to the Community Health 

Workers system, the provision of equipment to health centres, and the nutrition and hygiene 

education in schools, complemented by fruit tree planting and school gardens. Part of the budget 

will also be used to support the cost of a representative Food Security and Nutrition Survey to 

support the M&E component of the Project and evaluate impact in terms of household dietary 

diversity at district levels.  

 

3.2.4 Gender Aspects 

 

3.2.4.1 In Ghana, women constitute 52% of the national Agricultural labour force, contribute 

46% to the total GDP and also produce 70% of subsistence crops (MOFA, 2002). In the SADA 

zone, where the project will be implemented, women play a major role in farming and food 

processing. Women are engaged in planting, weeding, harvesting, processing and marketing of 

agricultural produce in the region. Women are involved in the agricultural processing and 

contribute at more than 70% of agriculture transformation. The gender analysis of the 

agriculture sector in the area revealed the gender gaps along the value chain, with women in a 

disadvantaged side. Most of the gender gaps are outlined in  access to land and farming 

equipment’s, access to extension services delivery, access to certified seeds supply, fertilizer 

and crop protection materials, access to agricultural technologies, agriculture processing, access 

to credit and financial services. The Project will contribute to implement the Gender and 

agriculture Strategy by empowering women in the agriculture production. 

 

3.2.4.2 To address the identified gender gaps, the project will implement specific activities and 

put in place measures to uplift the conditions of women in the agriculture value chain, as 

follows: i) Engage with the traditional authorities and family heads to ensure land security for 

women in the project; ii) Ensure that equipment is easy to use and woman-friendly; iii) Ensure 

that women have equal access to improved inputs; iv) Train women and men on safe storage 

options for their produce and utilization of fertilizers; (v) ensure that women have equal access 

to marketing networks; and vi) Organize training for women in the areas of improved 

production, business management, financial literacy, packaging, leadership and decision 

making; good nutrition especially to pregnant women and under five-year children; and (vi) 

organise sensitizations on women’s rights and access to land. The total budget allocated to 

gender equality promotion and nutrition is around UA I million.  

 

3.2.5 Involuntary Resettlement 

 

There is no involuntary resettlement or land acquisition or any loss, by the population, of 

property, sources of income and livelihoods envisioned within the implementation of the 

Project activities. The project interventions will be implemented on existing agricultural 

systems but if any loss occurs it will be compensated based on AfDB requirements.  

 

 

 

 

 



 

15 

IV IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1. Implementation arrangements 

4.1.1 The Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) is the Executing Agency of the 

Savannah Zone Agricultural Productivity Improvement Project (SAZAPIP). A National Project 

Steering Committee (NPSC) will be constituted chaired by the Hon. Minister of MOFA or his 

representative, to provide strategic direction and oversight guidance to the project. To ensure 

effective project coordination and monitoring, the day-to-day project administration will be 

managed by a Project Coordination and Management Unit (PCMU) within MOFA, under the 

direct supervision of the Chief Director. The PCMU will be headed by a Project Coordinator 

who will report to the Chief Director, and also to the Northern Regional Director of Agriculture. 

The Ministry had used a similar arrangement to successfully implement Bank financed projects 

such as the Northern Rural Growth Program (NRGP), Export Marketing and Quality Awareness 

Project (EMQAP), and Afram Plains District Agricultural Development Project (APDADP). 

The Ministry is thus familiar with the Bunk’s financial management rules, procurement 

requirements and disbursements procedures. MOFA is already connected to the government 

integrated financial information management system (GIFMIS), although the system is yet to 

be fully deployed for all projects. Thus, the PCMU of the proposed project will adopt the Sun 

Accounting software of the just completed NRGP for financial accounting and reporting, and 

migrate to the GIFMIS when the system is fully deployed to projects.  
  
4.1.2 The PCMU staff will be competitively recruited by MOFA and located in the office 

premises of the Regional Department of Agriculture at Tamale. The staff requirement will 

include: the Project Coordinator, a Financial Controller, an Accounts Officer, Agronomist, a 

Monitoring and Evaluation Specialists, an Agribusiness specialist, an Agricultural Engineer and 

a Procurement Specialist. The services of other experts such as Irrigation specialist, Gender and 

Nutrition specialist and Environmental specialist will be drawn from regional government 

institutions. For implementation of nutrition related activities, the PCMU will collaborate with 

other Government stakeholders including the Ghana Health Services, the Ghana School 

Feeding Program and the Ghana Education Regional Offices. SADA will play an active role in 

work activity planning, implementation monitoring and also attracting investors to collaborate 

with the Project. Relevant government agencies such as Projects Coordination Unit, Crop 

Services Directorate, Agricultural Engineering Services Directorate (AESD), Ghana Irrigation 

Development Authority (GIDA), Plant Protection and Regulatory Services Directorate 

(PPRSD), Ghana Grains and Legumes Development Board (GLDB), Environmental Protection 

Authority and Ministry of Trade Industry (MoTI) will be supported to conduct macro-

monitoring of the project’s activities.  
 

4.1.3 A National Project Steering Committee (NPSC) will be established to provide 

strategic policy direction and oversight guidance for the project implementation. Its core 

activities shall include implementation of program strategy, oversee planning, review progress 

and impact, review/ approval of annual work plans and budgets as well as ensuring effective 

linkages with related programs. The NPSC membership would include: (i) one representative 

each from the relevant ministries (MOFA, MOTI MOF, MLGRD, MORH); (ii) one 

representative from selected public-sector agencies and institutions (BoG, DFR, EPA, SADA); 

(iii) three representatives from the Farmer Based Organizations; (v) three representatives from 

large-scale private sector traders/processors; and (vi) four representative from private investors 

and management firms of commodity chains facilities. NPSC meetings would be chaired by the 

Hon. Minister of MOFA or his designated representative, with the Project Coordinator as 

secretary. The NPSC would meet at least twice a year. Costs related to the meetings of the 

NPSC will be financed from ADF loan. 



 

16 

 

Procurement arrangements 
 

4.1.4 “Procurement of goods (including non-consultancy services), works and the acquisition 

of consulting services, financed by the Bank for the project, will be carried out in accordance 

with the “Procurement Policy and Methodology for Bank Group Funded Operations” (BPM), 

dated October 2015 and following the provisions stated in the Financing Agreement. 

Specifically, Procurement would be carried out following: 

 

4.1.5 Borrower Procurement System (BPS): Procurement through Open competitive Bidding 

National (OCBN) procedures will be carried out using BPS comprising its Laws and 

Regulations (Ghana Public Procurement Act, 2003 (Act 663), as amended Act, 2016 (Act 914) 

using the national Standard Solicitation Documents (SSDs) agreed during project negotiations” 

for various group of transactions to be entailed under the project, detailed in annex B 5.1 and 

the provisions stipulated in the Financing Agreement.  

 

4.1.6 Bank Procurement Policy and Methodology (BPM): Bank standard PMPs, using the 

relevant Bank Standard Solicitation Documents (SDDs), will be used for Open Competitive 

Bidding International (OCBI) contracts for both goods and works and Acquisition of 

Consulting Services as indicated in the Technical Annex B5, Para. B.5.3.2.  

 

4.1.7 Procurement Risks and Capacity Assessment (PRCA): the assessment of procurement 

risks at the Country, Sector, and Project levels and of procurement capacity at the Executing 

Agency (EA), were undertaken for the project and the output have informed the decisions on 

the procurement regimes (BPS and Banks PMP) being used for specific transactions or groups 

of similar transactions under the project. The appropriate risks mitigation measures have been 

included in the procurement PRCA action plan proposed in Annex B5, Para 5.3.2. The project 

activities derived from these components has informed the procurement risk and capacity 

assessment as well as the market analysis based on which the procurement strategy of the 

project has been developed. In addition some of the identified activities will require that MoUs 

are adopted to engage the services of some of the project partners including research institutions 

and the details of these arrangements are clearly defined in the technical annexes, B5. 

 

 Financial management and disbursement arrangements  

 

4.1.8 The Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) through its Project Coordination and 

Management Unit model will be directly responsible for the financial management 

arrangements of the project. The Project financial management will be headed by the FMS, 

who shall be a seasoned chartered accountant with hands-on experience on AfDB FM rules and 

procedures, assisted by an experienced Accounts Officer and Accounts Assistant/ Clerk. MOFA 

has not identified qualified accountants from within its ranks that can fill the top project FM 

positions, and would thus be expected to competitively fill the FMS and Accounts Officer 

positions. Both persons will be required to be proficient in the use of Sun Accounting Software 

and the practical application of IPSAS Cash Basis of Accounting. The Accounts Assistant 

position shall however be deployed from existing MOFA staff for staff capacity building and 

knowledge transfer purposes. In harmony with Government of Ghana (GoG) accounting 

standards and practices within MOFA, the project shall adopt the IPSAS Cash Basis for 

financial reporting.  

4.1.9 In terms of information flow, the FMS will report to the PC and to the Finance Director 

of MOFA (to ensure project results are correctly included in the overall consolidated accounts 



 

17 

of the Ministry). The FMS will be required to produce quarterly unaudited interim financial 

reports (IFRs) and annual financial reports in accordance with IPSAS Cash Basis, from the Sun 

Accounting software. The IFRs must be submitted to the Bank within 30 days after the end of 

the quarter reported on, while the annual audited financial reports must be submitted not later 

than six (6) months after the end of the applicable financial year. MOFA internal control 

systems, including the internal audit function (which appears adequate and operating 

effectively) shall be extended to the cover project operations too. A Project Implementation 

Manual (PIM) consisting of Technical Implementation, FM procedures and Administrative 

procedures components will be developed and adopted from the NRGP PIM, to guide project 

implementation, streamline FM practices and administrative procedures. Previous audits of 

MOFA managed Bank financed projects were generally satisfactory, however the finance staff 

tended to leave the service of MOFA/the project on completion of the project activities. 

 

4.1.10 Disbursement: Two of the Bank’s four disbursement methods are recommended to be 

used in disbursing funds to the project: (i) Direct payments; and (ii) Payments through Special 

Account (SA). Direct payments method will generally be used for the larger contracts signed 

between project management and contractors/suppliers/ service providers, while the SA method 

will be used for meeting recurrent/ administrative expenses and smaller contracts. A US Dollar 

denominated SA will be opened at the Bank of Ghana (BoG), to receive ADF resources from 

the Bank. A GHS (local currency) account will be opened at BoG to receive transfers from the 

SA for making payments in Ghana Cedis. A second GHS account will be opened at the BoG to 

receive counterpart cash contributions from the Government of Ghana. All project accounts 

will be managed by the PCMU. All disbursements under the project will follow the 

disbursements procedures outlined in the Bank’s Disbursement Handbook.  

 

4.1.11 Audit: The project will be audited by an external audit firm, selected competitively, and 

in accordance with agreed procedures involving the Ghana Audit Service (GAS), which despite 

having the constitutional mandate for all government audits, tends to outsource the audits of 

donor projects to acceptable audit firms. The audit will be conducted on terms of reference 

acceptable to the Bank, and shall be submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the 

end of the year audited.  

 

4.1.12 Overall Conclusion: The overall FM risk is assessed as moderate. To mitigate the risk 

further, MOFA is expected to hire an FMS and Accounts Officer for the project; develop a PIM 

which includes technical, financial management and administrative procedures components; 

and adopt/ upgrade the existing Sun Systems accounting software for use by the project.  

4.2 Monitoring 

4.2.1 The foundation for the overall project monitoring and evaluation systems will be the 

logical framework, a series of key performance indicators and project operational manual 

(POM) which will be prepared by the PCMU shortly after project loan approval. MOFA will 

monitor overall operations for planning and facilitation purposes for the production aspects of 

the project, implementation of the drainage and roads infrastructure for attainment of national 

standards. The PCMU will monitor and evaluate overall impact of the project including 

environmental and social compliance and performance and compile the project’s quarterly and 

annual reports for dissemination to the Bank Group, MOFA, other line ministries, and SADA. 

A mid-term review (MTR) will be undertaken two years after project start to review the 

project’s achievements and constraints. Similarly, upon completion of project investments at 

the end of program year four, the PCMU will prepare a Borrower’s project completion report.

4.2.2 The initial assessment of national capacity indicates a satisfactory rating. The Ghana 

Statistical Service leads the efficient production and management of quality official statistics 

based on international standards, and will be used to assess the contribution of the project 

towards the country and regional development goals and objectives as defined in the relevant 

development plans. In using the performance indicators and targets specified in the results-

based framework, project implementers tracking progress towards project results are expected 

to take special note of changes that reflect advancement towards the translation of outputs into 

development outcomes. In developing monitoring and planning indicators, they will be gender 

disaggregated. The key functions of the M&E Officer in the PCMU will be to ensure quality 

and accountability of monitoring; information management; facilitation of knowledge building; 

and knowledge sharing on monitoring and evaluation. 

4.3. Governance 

Based on Bank’s experience in implementing projects in Ghana, the existing governance 

practices and controls have been deemed satisfactory. The implementation of SAZAPIP 

requires good governance at all levels from the national to District levels. This is in relation to 

better responsiveness, transparency, accountability and efficiency in the use of resources. 

Hence, the institutional arrangement has been designed to ensure good governance, and will 

serve as an instrument for achieving Project objectives.  

 

4.4. Sustainability 

 

The ownership of the SAZAPIP is made manifest by the roles that various stakeholders played 

during formulation and preparation of the Project. The Ministry of Food and Agriculture put up 

a technical team of experts to review the various reports produced by the consultants. The 

maintenance of the access roads and sundry infrastructure will be included in the annual 

recurrent budget of the District Assemblies where the project sites reside. The present Project 

will build capacities of the Regional agricultural officers in agri-business management to ensure 

profitability for the value chain actors. 

4.5 Risk management 

The current agricultural policy and sectoral strategies of Ghana have been developed in a 

consultative manner with the full participation of all relevant stake holders. The Bank Group 

will engage in constant policy dialogue to ensure that the policy, institutional and funding 

(particularly public expenditure) environment remain conducive to agricultural growth and 

development. Furthermore, social risks will be reduced through gender-sensitive approaches 

and ensuring that the poor are not excluded from project benefits. SAZAPIP is expected to be 

classified as a Category 2 because the project activities are expected to have environmental and 

social impacts that can be avoided and minimised since they will mostly be site-specific. 

Climate screening is yet to be done. The following are the main risks identified and with 

mitigation measures.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

19 

Risks  Mitigation measures 

Macroeconomic risks - High 

probability: slow economic growth 

and deterioration of the country’s 

creditworthiness due to fall in cocoa 

and other commodity prices.  

Mitigation measure: The Bank will intensify the dialogue with 

the government to adopt supportive macroeconomic policies to 

rationalize fiscal expenditure, introduce exchange rate flexibility, 

strengthen the banking system to prevent systemic crisis, and 

implement structural reforms for economic diversification. 

Environmental, Social and Climate 

Risk – Medium probability: The 

project activities are anticipated to 

have site specific environmental and 

social risks. The proposed project 

area is prone to climate change 

impacts. 

Mitigation measures: An ESMF has been developed for the 

project. During project implementation, site specific ESMPs will 

incorporate integrated pest management plans and climate risk 

mitigation and adaptation measures. ESMP development and 

implementation will be part of the monitoring and reporting of the 

project activities.  

4.6 Knowledge Building 

Knowledge building will be vital to the success of the Project. Considering the new approach 

in agricultural commodity value chains development, the results of the Project will be 

monitored closely. Knowledge will be built on the evolving concept of decentralized 

implementation unit located in the District; the role of value chain actors including farmers and 

farmers’ organization, women, youth, private sector, commercial and public sector. Knowledge 

will be captured using analysis of M&E database, supervision missions, mid-term reports, and 

periodic impact assessments and field exchange visits of the stakeholders within and outside 

the production clusters. In addition, knowledge would be disseminated by showcasing the 

Project results using Bank’s communication systems (Intranet, short documentaries on Bank 

website, etc.). For the purposes of publicity and sharing of project results, the project could 

recruit a local firm as and when the need be. The Farmer Field Schools will serve as sources of 

innovative knowledge and information sharing learning tools empowering farmers and other 

actors of the value chain to train their peers, share knowledge and experiences, thus reducing 

their overdependence on the public extension agents. This will also expand significantly the 

number of value chain actors having access to the disseminated knowledge and information. 

The technical assistance supports will introduce and consolidate knowledge and skills, and 

facilitate technology and skills transfer both at the community and national levels. It is 

envisaged that knowledge generated by the pilot demonstration plots will form the basis for 

private sector investment in the agribusiness in the ecological zone as part of TASI.
