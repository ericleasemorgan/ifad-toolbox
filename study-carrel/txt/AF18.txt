PROJECT SUMMARY 

1. Overview: The Gambia Climate Smart Rural WASH Development Project 

(CSRWASHDEP) aims to increase access to safe and sustainable water supply, sanitation and 

hygiene in The Gambia, targeting residents of rural and peri urban communities, and deprived 

urban communities with poor waste management practices in an environment facing increasing 

climate change threats of flash flooding and periods of extreme drought1. The Project is 

designed to deliver the objectives through an Integrated Water Resources Management 

(IWRM) approach. The IWRM approach entails coordinated stakeholder interventions to 

improve the quality of economic and livelihood-driven interaction with nature’s water cycle 

(the Hydrological Cycle) in a manner that promotes safe, equitable and sustainable utilisation 

of the water resources; the approach naturally embeds the need to improve sanitation, and to 

address the potential climate change impacts. Therefore, the Project interventions are premised 

on the following key building blocks, thus: (i) providing climate resilient WASH infrastructure, 

including infrastructure for monitoring the occurrence of water resources; (ii) fostering 

coordination and active participation of all sector specific and sector relevant 

agencies/stakeholders in addition to building their capacity for IWRM; (iii) improving beneficiary 

communities’ sanitation & hygiene knowledge, attitudes and practices, as well as enhancing their 

awareness and adoption of relevant climate change adaptation measures; (iv) promoting 

beneficiaries’ gainful participation in the delivery of WASH services, including nurturing public-

private partnerships at the lowest appropriate level; and (vi) introducing livelihood-centred 

measures to protect and sustain the aquatic environment. The approach will enhance the expected 

positive impact on environmental health and livelihoods, the overall socio-economic well-

being, and sustainability of the WASH services.  

2. The Project is estimated to cost UA 27.47 million (GMD 1.8845 billion), of which the 
ADF contribution is UA 3.00million, TSF-Pillar 1 contribution is UA 2.50million, RWSSI-TF 

contribution is UA 1.69 million (EUR2.00million), GEF contribution is UA 6.21 million 

(USD9.00million), GCF contribution is UA 6.90 million (USD 10 million) and AF contribution 

is UA 6.90 million (USD 10 million). The Government of The Gambia counterpart 

contribution, estimated at UA280,000, will be in kind and comprised of salaries and value of 

land for the infrastructure. The project will be implemented over a period of approximately 63 

months beginning September 2018. 

3. The Project is targeted at the rural and peri-urban areas where over 45% of The 
Gambia’s 1.9 million people live, with coverage of 79.4% but inequitable access to safe water 

supply, and limited access (40.8%) to improved sanitation compared with national average 

figures of 86.1% for water supply and 64.9% for sanitation2. The Project includes delivery of 

better waste management services to improve environmental conditions and better protect  

national water resources in changing climatic conditions, particularly in riverine and coastal 

communities. An estimated 500,000 people will be direct beneficiaries of the project, 

contributing to the realisation of SDG 6 (water and sanitation) in particular. Another 400,000 

urban and peri-urban/rural growth centers residents will be indirect beneficiaries of the 

improved environment resulting from the waste management interventions under the Project.  

4. Needs Assessment: The Gambia’s total water withdrawal of about 0.1 km3 per year is 
less than 1.5 % of the estimated total renewable water resource potential of 6.5 km3 per year. 

However, the uneven distribution and constraints in water resources development for safe water 

supply make access difficult for many people in rural and peri urban areas. National safe water 

coverage in The Gambia is reported to be 86.1% (National Development Plan (2018)), but

access is inequitable, while only about 40.8% of the rural population has access to improved 

sanitation despite higher figures reported by WHO/UNICEF JMP (2015 update). Open 

defecation is prevalent in rural areas. Generally, local councils are unable to cope with the 

increased waste generation due to population growth, thereby resulting in indiscriminate waste 

disposal, frequent flooding and prevalence of sanitation related diseases, particularly in the 

peri-urban sprawl of the capital city, Banjul, and other rural growth centres. Extreme climate 

events exacerbates the problem thereby perpetuating the poverty cycle. Therefore the delivery 

of sustainable WASH and waste management infrastructure and services requires immediate 

attention.  

5. The Bank’s added value: The Bank has had accumulated experience in The Gambia 
and elsewhere in similar states of transition.  The Bank has had the strongest presence in the 

water and sanitation sector in The Gambia compared with other key development partners 

during the height of economic hardship and civil disorder. The Bank’s on-going and quite 

successful operation in the sector has been the only major sector intervention in the past five 

(5) years. The Gambia Country Brief emphasizes the need to improve access to safe water and 

improved sanitation as one of the key interventions for calming the underlying fragility 

currents, which is in line with the Bank’s TYS-High 5 priority goal of Improving the quality of 

life for the people of Africa. Given the goodwill of the current Government and the Bank’s 

convening power, continued active participation in the sector has the potential to attract 

additional resources for the sector.  The previous involvement calls for the Bank’s continued 

engagement to ensure sustainability of the progress made thus far. Further, the Bank’s Climate 

Change Action Plan II (2016-2020) includes measures to support activities that enhance 

Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) of Regional Member Countries (RMCs). In 

particular, the Bank aims to increase climate finance mobilization to 40% of total approvals by 

2020 including 50% adaptation finance. By funding this project and raising external climate 

co-finance, the Bank meets both its climate change targets and those of The Gambia’s NDC. 

6. Knowledge Management: The project will assist Government to institutionalise the 
IWRM approach to providing WASH services. Knowledge will be generated through 

supervisions, impact studies, Annual Sector Reviews, Mid-Term Review and Project 

Completion reports. The proposed introduction of appropriate waste-to-energy treatment 

technology, besides the approach to improving rural household sanitation through micro-credit, 

as well as the grassroots partnerships with small businesses to improve waste management will 

provide further insight into enhancing sustainability of WASH services. The lessons learned 

will benefit The Gambia as well as future Bank operations across the continent.  The respective 

knowledge will be shared at regional sector events such as the Africa Water Week and 

AfricaSan.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE ADB GROUP 

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE GAMBIA FOR 

THE CLIMATE SMART RURAL WATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE 

DEVELOPMENT PROJECT 
 

Management submits the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed ADF Grant of 

UA 3.0 million, TSF-Pillar 1 Grant of UA 2.5 million, RWSSI-TF Grant of UA 1.69 million 

(EUR 2.0 million), in addition to GEF co-financing of UA 6.21million (USD 9.00 million), 

GCF co-financing of UA 6.90 million (USD 10 million) and AF co-financing of UA 6.9 million 

(USD6.90 million) to the Republic of The Gambia to finance the Climate Smart Rural Water, 

Sanitation and Hygiene Development Project. 

 

I –  STRATEGIC THRUST & RATIONALE 

1.1.  Project linkages with country strategy and objectives 

1.1.1 The draft National Development Plan (NDP) (2018 – 2021) provides the framework for 

implementing Government’s development agenda.  The Goal of the NDP is to deliver good 

governance and accountability, social cohesion, and national reconciliation and a revitalized 

and transformed economy for the wellbeing of all Gambians.  Governance and economic 

management, agriculture modernization, human capital development, infrastructure & energy, 

tourism, gender equality, youth empowerment as well as private sector development constitute 

the strategic priorities of the NDP.  

1.1.2 The NDP defines the water and sanitation sector goal as “Improved, Equitable Access 

to Safe and Affordable Water and Sanitation, Good Hygiene Practices, and Environmental 

Protection Promoted for All”; and recommends three (3) key measures to improve the quality 

of life of Gambians as: (a) increased resource mobilization through donors and public private 

partnerships to construct and upgrade water supply and environmental sanitation infrastructure 

to improve access and enhance public health; (b) strengthening of community structures for 

effective maintenance and management of facilities; and (c) strengthening of social and 

behavioural change communication through sensitization campaigns.  

1.1.3 In line with the NDP (2018 – 2023), the Bank’s Country Brief (CB) (2017-2019), a 

successor of JAS II (2015-2017), provides the short term operational framework for Bank’s 

development assistance with emphasis on macro-economic stabilization and transformation, 

improved governance and economic management.  Priority areas of intervention include 

energy, infrastructure, governance and finance. The CB recognises Water, Sanitation and 

Hygiene (WASH) as a critical area of intervention for improved health and socio- economic 

outcomes for the population in The Gambia. The proposed project is an integral part of the CB 

development assistance program and takes into account existing national policies & strategies 

such as the Water Policy (2006), Sanitation Policy (2015-2020), NAPA, and Agricultural 

Policy in addition to the SDGs, particularly SDG 6 on water and sanitation.  

1.1.4 The proposed project is also in line with the Bank Group’s High Five priorities by 

improving the quality of life of the people of The Gambia, and to an extent electrifying Africa 

through provision of waste-to-energy infrastructure and solar power for water systems. It 

contributes to the Ten Year Strategy, particularly the pillars on infrastructure and governance, 

and takes into account the twin objectives of inclusive and green growth, and emphasises cross 

cutting issues such as gender equality and private sector participation. It also conforms to the 



 

2 

 

Bank's Water Resources Management, Human Capital, Urban Development Strategy and the 

Gender Strategy 2014-18.    

1.2.  Rationale for Bank’s involvement 

1.2.1  The Gambia is among the least water stressed countries in the world as total water 

withdrawal is less than 1.5 % of the total renewable water resources potential of 6.5km3 per 

year.  However, uneven distribution of fresh sources and constraints in water resources 

development and management of safe drinking water make access difficult for many segments 

of the population, especially those in the rural areas who often rely on unsafe water sources. 

The JMP (2015 update) figures suggest that the country met its MDG targets for the sector.  

Reportedly, access to potable water is a little over 86.1% (NDP, 2018) while access to improved 

sanitation is about 64.9% (2016) across The Gambia. Open defecation is prevalent in rural 

areas, and most communities in the peri-urban areas are not able to provide sanitation facilities 

for their household use thereby contributing to high prevalence of preventable WASH-related 

diarrhoeal diseases. Per capita waste generation is above the capacity of the municipal councils 

in the peri-urban/rural growth centres resulting in severe challenges in waste management and 

high vulnerabilities among communities.   

1.2.2  According to the NDP, water and sanitation services are unable to keep pace with 

demand as a result of the high population growth rate and increasing rate of urbanization. Sector 

specific challenges include poor operation and maintenance practices, inadequate investments, 

lack of qualified staff and poor coordination, and low hygiene and sanitation practices. The 

proposed project seeks to address these challenges, and contributes to bridge the financing gap 

towards attaining the SDGs, given that Government has not been able to meet the sector 

investment requirements of about USD 14 million to meet the 2015 MDG targets for improved 

rural water supply and sanitation (AMCOW Country Status Overview for The Gambia, 2010). 

This is also in line with The Gambia’s Nationally Determined Contributed (NDC) ratified on 

7th November 2016 and became effective on 10th December 2016. The NDC under its climate 

adaptation targets underscores waste management, particularly in the Brikama and greater 

Banjul areas. 

1.2.3  Climate Change events have had an adverse impact on the aquatic environment and 

WASH sector in The Gambia. Such climate variability is being translated into negative impacts 

on drinking water availability and quality, besides exacerbating the risks associated with lack 

of access to improved sanitation, including faecal and solid waste management. The proposed 

project provides opportunity to adopt the necessary climate change mitigation and adaptation 

measures including limiting the use of fossil fuels as a source of power in the delivery of water 

and sanitation services.     

1.2.4  Given the large proportion of unemployed youth, particularly in rural areas where 

women are poor and sometimes marginalized, the proposed project provides opportunity for 

youth employment and women economic empowerment and will result in reduction in the 

current drudgery that women and children go through to provide water for their families. The 

proposed project also supports and builds on the existing arrangements for decentralised local 

governance to foster institutional sustainability. Meeting such needs is considered paramount 

in Government effort to improve sector performance towards achieving inclusive and green 

growth.  

1.2.5  The Bank has had accumulated experience and the strongest presence in the water and 

sanitation sector in The Gambia compared with other key development partners during the 



 

3 

 

period of economic hardship and civil disorder. The Bank’s on-going operation in the sector 

has been the only major sector intervention in the past five (5) years. The CB emphasizes the 

need to improve access to safe water and improved sanitation as one of the key interventions 

for calming the underlying fragility currents. Given the goodwill of the current Government 

and the Bank’s convening power, continued active participation in the sector has the potential 

to attract additional resources for sector financing. The previous involvement calls for the 

Bank’s continued engagement to ensure sustainability of the progress made thus far.  

1.2.6 The Bank’s Climate Change Action Plan II (2016-2020) aims to support Regional 

Member Countries (RMCs) to implement their Nationally Determined Countries (NDCs). The 

CCAP2 outlines the Bank’s target to scale up climate finance to 40% of total approvals by 

2020; 50% as adaptation finance. The Gambia Climate Smart WASH project contributes to the 

Bank’s climate finance target as well as The Gambia NDC adaptation targets.

1.3.1 The Gambia is a signatory to the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, and most 

external partners aligned their assistance with country objectives as presented in the 

Programme for Accelerated Growth and Employment (PAGE) which ended in 2015. Besides 

the close cooperation between the AfDB and the WBG on the expired JAS-I and II, donor 

harmonization is only advanced in the education sector. Sector coordination groups are not 

necessarily active. However, the current macro-economic situation and related prospects have 

supported revival of the budget support group comprising the AfDB, EU, IMF and the WBG. 

The AfDB coordinates with IFAD in the agriculture sector. 

 

1.3.2 According to the Aid Bulletin of the Gambia, July 2016, there has been sharp decline 

of development partner activities since 2014.  In addition to the AfDB, major sector 

development partners have included the Islamic Development Bank, EU, DFID, OPEC, 

UNDP, IFAD, UN Agencies, Taiwan China, and JICA. Between 2002 and 2012, the IsDB, 

EU, JICA, the Saudi Arabia Government and UNDESA contributed a little over USD 41 

million, averaging about USD 4 million per year as investments in rural water supply and 

sanitation. However, since 2014, there has been a sharp decline of development partner 



 

4 

 

activities (Aid Bulletin of The Gambia, July 2016). Only three donors (AfDB, IsDB and EU) 

disbursed funds to the sector between 2012 and 2015. Since then, apart from the AfDB that has 

recently completed sector investments amounting to about USD 2 million per year, there are 

no other major development partners active in the rural WASH sub- sector, except UNICEF 

which is about to launch their 5-year country program (USD 1.0 million per year) that will 

focus on nutrition, maternal and child health, with little emphasis on WASH in public health 

facilities. There are ongoing UN led GEF-LDCF and GCF financed climate change adaptation 

activities focusing on restoration of the natural environment and development of early warning 

systems. 

 
II –  PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

2.1. Project objectives 

2.1.1 The overall goal of the project is to contribute to the National Development Plan- water 

sector goal of “improved equitable access to safe and affordable water supply and sanitation, 

good hygiene practices and environmental protection promoted for all”. The specific 

objectives of the proposed project are to: (i) increase sustainable access to safe water by 17% 

and access to safely managed sanitation by 2%; (ii) enhance services delivery capacity in the 

sector; and (iii) improve livelihoods through nurturing safe water and sanitation services related 

opportunities for women and youth employment.  The project is designed to achieve the 

objectives through well-coordinated stakeholder interventions aimed at improving the quality 

of economic and livelihood-driven interaction with nature’s water cycle (the Hydrological 

Cycle) in a manner that promotes safe, equitable and sustainable utilisation of the water 

resources while paying due attention to related climate change impact adaptation.  

2.2.  Project components 

2.2.1 The foregoing climate-smart Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) 

approach has guided structuring of the project interventions on the basis of the following key 

building blocks: (i) providing basic WASH infrastructure, and using solar energy as the source of 

power in delivering water and sanitation services and for water resources monitoring; (ii) fostering 

coordination and active participation of all sector specific and sector relevant 

agencies/stakeholders in addition to supporting relevant human resources development; (iii) 

developing management tools and information systems for effective and sustainable development 

and monitoring of water resources in a climate change context; (iv) improving beneficiary 

communities sanitation & hygiene knowledge, attitudes and practices, as well as enhancing their 

awareness and adoption of relevant climate change adaptation measures; (v) Generating power 

from waste, and promoting youth and women engagement in income generating waste 

management activities such as recycling of household waste for re-use in agriculture, crafts 

industry and  for cooking fuel;(vi) Livelihood-centred measures to protect and sustain the aquatic 

environment through  improving the practices of agriculture and fisheries value chains actors; as 

well as (vii) facilitating public-private partnerships in the delivery of WASH services. 

2.2.2 The interventions are also focused on complementing previous and on-going initiatives 

supported by other development partners, including UNICEF/GWP Strategic Framework for 

development of climate resilient WASH infrastructure in The Gambia and GCF-UNEP project. 

The project components presented in Table 2.1 are described in detail in Technical Annexes

2.2.3 The selected key technologies, such as the use of solar power for water pumping, have 

been adopted by previous projects in the Gambia and West Africa in general, with minimal and 

affordable operation and maintenance costs, thereby ensuring sustainability. The project will also 

support decentralized planning and decision making at the local level, thereby maximizing the 

benefit at the lowest most appropriate levels. 

2.2.4  The approach to improve waste management by intervening along the entire value chain 

from collection and treatment through the ustilisation of both solid and liquid waste to produce 

energy for the national grid, in addition to extensively and intensively promoting sorting of 

domestic waste for reuse of organic and non-organic fractions, such as for compost production 

and recycling of plastics, complement ongoing interventions supported by NGOs and the Area 

Councils.  The innovation to establish a credit fund to enable local transport associations to 

acquire dual purpose transportation vehicles to service waste haulage on one part, instead of 

providing the vehicles directly to the local councils, is expected to strengthen the current 

partnership of the councils with the transport associations and guarantee sustainability of the 

waste haulage/transportation establishment.  

 

2.3.  Technical solution retained and other alternatives explored 

 

2.3.1  Technical solutions that have been considered and retained are based on their 

consistency with the revised National Development Plan (2017 – 2021) and related Sector 

Strategies and Action Plans, and also derive from lessons learnt in implementing pilot 

initiatives in The Gambia and elsewhere. The solutions also consider Government effort to 

improve access to sound environmental health and sanitation services, coupled with economic 

empowerment and improved livelihoods as means to improve the well-being of rural and peri-

urban people. Alternative solutions explored but not retained are presented in Table 2.2.

 Inherent focus on profit without duly 
addressing the attendant environmental risks 

for which oversight capacity from the public 

sector is still limited. 

2.4.  Project type 

2.4.1  A standalone project approach is adopted given that the national program for the sector 

has not yet been developed. Moreover there is limited intervention on part other potential sector 

development partners, and basket funding could also not be considered in the current 

circumstances of limited local presence and absence of a partner coordination forum. The 

project design provides for nurturing coordination among national sector stakeholders and 

sector development partners. 

2.5.  Project cost and financing arrangements 

2.5.1  The total cost of the Project, net of taxes and duties, is estimated at UA 27.47 million 

(GMD 1,884.50 million), of which 63% is foreign currency and 27% is local currency. The 

cost estimates are derived from preparatory studies and costs of similar projects financed by 

the AfDB and others in The Gambia in recent past. The estimates take into account provision 

of 9% physical contingency and 11% price contingency. The project cost details are presented

the implementing entity for GEF, GCF and AF grant financing estimated at UA 20 million 

(GMD 1,372.19 million) representing 72 % of the total costs.  GoTG will contribute the 

equivalent of UA 280,000 (GMD 145,000 million) of the total costs. GEF, GCF and AF 

resources are programmed to come on stream after June 2019 when the respective approval 

formalities are expected to be completed. Details of the project cost estimates are presented in 

Technical Annex C5. 

2.5.3 In accordance with the Bank’s policy on expenditure eligibility for Bank Group 

financing, the Government contribution in kind of less than 10% of the project cost takes into 

account: (i) Gambia’s commitment to implement its overall development program as evidenced 

by the recent launch of the National Development Plan 2018 - 2021; (ii) Gambia’s budget 

situation and high public debt at 124% of GDP (2018 National Budget); and (iii) the enhanced 

commitment to the WASH sector as evidenced by the increase in allocation of resources to

2.6.  Project’s target area and population  

2.6.1  The Project will be implemented in about 170 rural and peri urban communities across 

the five regions in The Gambia, where access to improved water supply, sanitation and hygiene 

is rather limited. According to the National Development Plan (2018), the rural population in 

The Gambia constitute about 60% of the national population; while about 1.2 million people 

have access to water supply, only about 790,000 people have access to safe sanitation. The rest 

resort to unsafe sources for water supply and majority of the rural population resort to open 

defecation. Given a growth rate of 3.3% per annum, the rural populat ion of about 1.0 million 

is expected to reach 2.3 million by 2040, resulting in additional pressure on existing 

infrastructure and services and dire environmental consequences if the situation is left 



 

10 

 

unaddressed. The Project therefore prioritizes interventions in the rural and peri-urban 

communities, where approximately 65 % (1.2 million) of the population lives. 

2.6.2 The proposed project will directly benefit an estimated 200,000 rural and peri-urban 

Gambians, particularly women and children who are expected to live healthier lives and trek 

lesser distances to fetch water. An additional 300,000 people will benefit from the interventions 

in improved solid and liquid waste management in addition to the betterment of the rapidly 

deteriorating aquatic environment which will, in turn, enhance climate change resilience. Other 

public and private sector institutions, including schools, health units, markets and small & 

micro-enterprises will also benefit from the project. It is expected that about 500 individuals 

and SMEs will benefit from aquatic resources management training and household waste re-

use/waste-for-cash training.  About 1,550 permanent and temporary jobs will be created. The 

opportunity for enhancing the individuals’ and SME’s operations through a targeted micro-

finance fund is expected to directly contribute to livelihood improvement and overall project 

outcome sustainability. Another 400,000 urban and peri urban residents in Kanifing Municipal 

and Brikama Area Councils will be indirect beneficiaries of the improved environmental 

sanitation resulting from the interventions in waste management.  

2.7.  Participatory process for project identification, design and implementation 

2.7.1 Extensive individual consultative meetings and focus group discussions were held with 
senior staff of key Ministries, Agencies and Departments, including the Councils, The Gambia 

Social Development Fund (SDF), relevant private sector operators, and representatives of 

primary beneficiaries at community level, as well as development partners and NGOs.  The 

outcome of the consultative meetings and focus group discussions, which was harmonised 

during the stakeholder workshops, provided the basis for the proposed project design. In 

particular, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) supported the establishment of 

irrigation demonstration in schools; UNICEF supported the need for improved water supply in 

public health facilities, given that their current investment program targeting such facilities is 

limited in scope and therefore insignificant compared with needs; European Union and WHO 

emphasised the need for implementation of the sector reforms and  welcomed the renewed 

commitment to increase sector investments; the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 

suggested focus on the effect of climate change, particularly resulting from anthropogenic 

activities of coastal and riparian communities on the aquatic environment. EPA emphasized 

the need for grassroots mobilisation and sensitisation to entrench waste-management-good- 

practice at the household level, besides promoting the production and use of organic compost 

from household waste. In addition, the MFWRNAM and MoFED concurred on the need to 

mainstream project management within the Rural Water Department, and to rehabilitate and 

expand the existing office space provided with asbestos roofing due to attendant risks to human 

health. The primary beneficiaries at community level gave credence to the need to improve the 

technical design of water supply and sanitation infrastructure; support to small businesses and 

individuals and creation of job opportunities to improve livelihoods; and establishment of a 

credit scheme to support delivery of domestic sanitation facilities and facilitate acquisition of 

vehicles for waste transportation. 

 

2.7.2  The project design has provided for the sector stakeholder coordination to continue 

during implementation through a Project Steering Committee with representation from all 

relevant sector stakeholders.  



 

11 

 

2.8.  Bank Group experience, lessons reflected in project design 

2.8.1 The performance of the Bank’s portfolio in the Gambia as at December 2017 was rated 

‘satisfactory’. Implementation Progress performance of the twelve (12) financing instruments 

as at February 2018 was rated as 42% satisfactory, with the average age of the national 

operations at  two (2) years. There are no pending Project Completion Reports.  

2.8.2 The design of the proposed project has been informed by lessons learned from 

implementation of social and infrastructure projects in The Gambia and elsewhere by both the 

Bank and other development partners. These include:  

i) Ensuring project implementation readiness to minimise project start-up delays 
following approval. Investment projects in The Gambia require significant start-up time 

due to the limited capacity to establish project implementation units, including 

performance of the necessary procurement activities. The project will retain 

experienced core staff of an existing PMU which was responsible for implementing the 

previous Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project as well as similar projects financed 

by other donors in the past..  The duly experienced staff fully participated in the project 

preparation and appraisal missions, an opportunity that enabled their full familiarisation 

with the project design. In addition. provision has been made for Advance Contracting 

for key services, including the recruitment additional of technical assistants for the 

PMU, for which all TOR were finalised during project appraisal – ref. Technical Annex 

C6 

ii) Following through on institutional reforms: Institutional reforms activities tend to 
be marginalised relative to infrastructure development and operations. This project has  

placed emphasis on  implementation of the relevant recommendations of the Bank’s 

(African Water Facility) National Water Sector Reform Project (2011 – 2016) and other 

studies funded by the European Union including strengthening of the Rural Water 

Division, facilitating universal adoption of the Operation and Maintenance strategy, and 

development of other sector regulations to facilitate effective implementation of the 

Sector Policy  

iii) Value Chain Approach and Other Innovations: The project design fully adopts an 
Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) approach.  IWRM essentially calls 

for WASH investments that facilitate coordinated human interaction with nature’s 

entire water value chain – the hydrological cycle – in a manner that promotes 

sustainable, safe and equitable access for all water users while ensuring protection of 

aquatic ecosystems.  In this regard, IWRM engrains the opportunity for meaningful and 

gainful participation of the primary beneficiaries which, in turn, enhances sustainability 

of the benefits. 

iv) Taking into account climate change adaptation and resilience is necessary to ensure 
environmental sustainability through better management of available water resources 

and protection of the environment. The project adopts Integrated Water resources 

Management (IWRM) approach to water supply and sanitation investment.  The IWRM 

approach naturally embeds and facilitates climate change adaptation in the WASH 

sector. 

v) Addressing weak gender inclusion/mainstreaming: A weak gender inclusion due to 
weak institutional capacity, inadequate knowledge about gender disparities in 

sanitation, and limited budgetary resources for inclusive growth can compromise 



 

12 

 

attainment of project objectives leading to entrenchment of poverty. The Project has 

extensively ensured gender inclusion in its activities.  

vi) Involvement of the private sector and NGOs, including support for youth 
employment and women economic empowerment: The project design offers 

opportunities for nurturing of SMEs and community based organisations that derive 

income from the WASH and related value chains. The project provides for appropriate 

skills development for women and the youth, in addition to provision of micro-credit 

funds to support establishment and improvement of WASH services and other related 

small businesses.  

2.9. Key performance indicators  

2.9.1  The Results-based Logical Framework presents the key performance indicators of the 

Project. The outcome indicators focus on strengthening sector performance monitoring and 

management, expected sector contribution to climate resilience, equitable access to WASH and 

job creation. The key outcome indicators include: (i) the carbon foot print reduction benefit; 

(ii) the timely publication of the annual Sector Performance Report (SPR) and convening of 

Annual Sector Review (ASR) conferences; (iii) increase in population with access to safely 

managed WASH services; and (iv) number of temporary and permanent jobs created of which 

at least 30% are expected to be women and 40% youth  

2.9.2  Progress towards development outcomes shall be monitored through the key output 

indicators that include: (i) number of WASH facilities, including solid & liquid waste 

management infrastructure, built and/or rehabilitated as well as the overall renewable energy 

capacity installed for WASH services delivery; (ii) the number of hard and soft tools, including 

climate resilience tools, developed and in use for enabling effective sector performance, 

monitoring and coordination; (iii) number of national and local sector stakeholders, including 

interns of various professional disciplines, trained in the delivery and management of WASH 

and related services of which at least 50% are expected to be women; (iv) number of livelihood-

centred tools and amenities developed for climate change adapted WASH management; and 

(v) the level of Micro & Small Enterprise (MSE) capacity created for purposes of contributing 

to sustainability of WASH services and aquatic resources.   

2.9.3 Ten (10) outcome indicators and forty two (42) output indicators, as further described 

in the comprehensive project Results-based Logical Framework (Technical Annex C), have 

been selected for monitoring project performance.   

 

III –  PROJECT FEASIBILITY 

3.1.  Economic and financial performance 

Table 3.1 Key economic and financial figures (details are provided in Annex B7) 

 FIRR, Financial NPV (base case): n/a 

EIRR, NPV (base case): 17.95%; USD 2.5 million 

 

3.1.1  The project has many financial and socio-economic benefits. It will guarantee drinking 

water supply for the communities in rural and peri-urban communities’ across The Gambia; 

improve hygiene, sanitation and health; and ensure fairer distribution of benefits among 

stakeholders (State, enterprises, sector operators, consumers). Considering the social nature of 



 

13 

 

the project, its financial goal will be financial equilibrium for operating the facilities and 

infrastructure sustainability.  

3.1.2  The economic returns are measured in terms of the benefits which accrue to 

beneficiaries in the form of regular and adequate drinking water supply, access to sanitation 

services, time gained,  decline in water-borne diseases ( Malaria, Typhoid and Diarrhea) due 

to improved hygiene and improved waste management systems, and a general improvement in 

living conditions. The project’s economic internal rate of return (IRR), which reflects its 

benefits, stands at 17.95%. This rate is calculated based on investment and operating costs and 

quantifiable project benefits represented by: (i) the economic value of the additional water 

produced; (ii) savings on the health budget of beneficiaries owing to a decline in water-borne 

diseases; (iii) time savings in fetching water and the number of hours gained and put into other 

useful activities. Based on an opportunity cost of capital (c.o.c) estimated at 10%, the net 

present value will be USD 17.9 million. The IRR is greater than the economic cost of capital 

and the NPV is positive indicating an economically viable project.  

3.1.3  An analysis of the project sensitivity test results (10% increase in investment costs, a 

10% reduction in benefits shows that the rate of return and the net present value remain at 

acceptable levels. The internal rate of return remains higher than the 10% coc at 14.42% and 

16.21%. The NPV remains positive in both cases at $10.51 million and $15.12 millions. Thus 

confirming the viability of the project. Even when the two above-cited scenarios are combined 

(10% increased investment cost, and 10% reduction in benefits) the project is still economically 

viable with an IRR of 14.42% and an NPV of $ 10.51 million. 

3.2. Environmental and Social Impacts 

3.2.1 The project has been classified as a Category 2 because it is expected to have site 

specific impacts that can easily be mitigated. Given that the project is programme based for 

which site specific ESMPs are not feasible at project design stage, and the need to comply with 

the Bank’s ISS, an ESMF, including the generic ESMP, has been developed to guide 

development and implementation of site specific ESMPs during project implementation. The 

project therefore complies with Bank’s ISS requirements and applicable national 

environmental and social regulations. The ESMF shall be cleared by the Bank for public 

disclosure in country before the end of April 2018, and subsequent disclosure of the summary 

on the Bank’s website in compliance with the Bank’s Category 2 requirements. 

3.2.2  The project will have environmental and social impacts related to water supply and 

sanitation projects. The anticipated impacts include: loss of vegetation and wildlife including 

habitat degradation and rehabilitation; air quality impacts and noise pollution and vibration; 

generation of waste and pollution of land and water resources from construction activities; 

public health impacts including HIV/AIDs and STIs, communicable and vector borne diseases; 

public safety during construction; labour conditions and occupational health and safety by 

contractors;  disruption of rural networks; increase in land and water conflicts. The project is 

not expected to have land acquisition because the infrastructure development will be done on 

public land or land that has already been voluntarily surrendered by beneficiary communities 

in accordance with current norms and practice in The Gambia.  

3.2.3 The positive impacts of the project among others will include: reduction in health risks 

and improved livelihoods of the local communities and livestock; reduction in drudgery, social 

tension and conflict among communities resulting from water shortages, particularly for 



 

14 

 

women and girls; Enhanced capacity of both sector institutions and beneficiary communities 

in IWRM which is critical to sustainability of project benefits; environmental cleanness 

benefits particularly the reduction of waste related infections and destruction of the aquatic 

environment; direct income for local households from employment opportunities; reduction in 

GHG emission and invariable climate change ramifications. In general, the beneficial impacts 

of the project from environmental and social perspective greatly outweigh potential adverse 

effects. 

3.2.4 The ESMF recommends the following range of mitigation and enhancement measures 

to be adopted by the project: establishment of water use management committees including 

basic training on maintenance of infrastructures or facilities; education on water-borne 

diseases; introduction of compulsory savings scheme; minimising of pipe trenches left open 

overnight and sealing off open trenches with reflective tape; sensitise communities on dangers 

of open trenches; assign responsibilities for water point/tap superintendence to individual 

volunteers; minimising loss of vegetation during clearing for construction and maximising 

restoration of the vegetation on completion of construction activities; sprinkling of water 

during truck movement with the village and no operation during rest period. In addition, 

standard hygiene procedures such as location of waste dumps and latrines will also be taken 

into consideration in the siting of boreholes and disinfection of the boreholes prior to pump 

installation; providing income opportunity by use of local community labour while limiting 

inflow of outsiders and associated conflicts and increase in sexually transmitted diseases; 

design water points to minimise contamination risks and sanitation facilities built with proper 

seals. Positive impacts will be enhanced by ensuring that the education and awareness measures 

go beyond water supply and sanitation to cover the implications resulting from systems and 

facilities failure due to negligence and improper care.  The mitigation and enhancement 

measures are detailed in Technical Annexes B8 and C6.  The project budget provision for 

implementing the ESMF is included in the relevant consultancy services and WASH 

infrastructure budgets, while monitoring of its implementation and monitoring is included in 

the M&E budget.  Therefore the TOR for the services contracts and infrastructure construction 

contracts shall cover all ESMF implementation requirements. 

3.2.5 The ESMF has clearly indicated the screening procedures and requirement to develop 

site specific ESMPs by updating and adapting the generic ESMP in the ESMF based on the 

identified local environmental and social impacts. In line with AfDB requirements, an 

extensive consultation process was conducted as part of project and ESMF development. 

Consultations were done during project preparation and appraisal with relevant stakeholders 

and this was complemented with further consultations during the development of the ESMF 

for the project.  The PCU that will have a full time Environmental Safeguards Specialist to 

oversee implementation of the ESMF and site specific ESMPs. Capacity building on 

development and implementation of ESMPs will be provided to strengthen local institutions. 

The overall responsibility of environmental and social risk monitoring as well as reporting on 

project E & S performance will lie with PCU and NEA as part of the overall project monitoring 

and reporting arrangements.   

3.2.6  Gender 

3.2.6.1 The Global Gender Gap Report 2017 ranked Gambia 100th out of 144 countries, on its 

progress towards gender parity in term of Economic Participation and Opportunity, 

Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, and Political Empowerment, reflecting the 

general vulnerability of women in the country. In addition, one of the main fragilities identified 

in The Gambia National Development Plan (NDP) 2018-2012, is the inadequate provision of 



 

15 

 

vital infrastructure services in water and sanitation and waste management. This situation is 

affecting mainly women and girls as the main accessors, couriers and transporters of water, 

besides shouldering the primary responsibility for hygiene at the community and household 

levels. The multiple roles of women play often subject them to crushing workloads leaving 

them with no time for other activities, worse is their exclusion from decision-making in the 

development of water and sanitation resources of their own communities. 

 

3.2.6.2  Given the critical importance of greater gender equality in the WASH sector, gender 

issues will be addressed through mainstreaming across the project activities as well as 

standalone activities. At the policy level, gender issues will be taken into account in the 

strategies that will be developed including definition of relevant gender targets. At operational 

level, the project will seek to ensure socio economic empowerment, increase the involvement 

of both genders in water resources development, sanitation and waste management, create 

conditions for equitable access by men and women to project resources and increase decision-

making for women through the following interventions: (i) Increasing women representation 

in decision making and ensure equal participation in management of water and sanitation 

infrastructure (i.e. WASH committees) and include the Ministry of Women Affairs in the 

Project Steering Committee; (ii) Facilitating equal access to finance and developing of the 

technical, leadership entrepreneurial skills of women led SMEs involved in protection of the 

aquatic environment including improvement for waste management, fish farming, marketing 

and processing, and vegetable irrigation activities; (iii) Building gender sensitive sanitation and 

hygiene facilities in schools and public places; (iii) selecting technological options that save 

time and reduce the burden on women and girl children to enable to have more time for 

productive activities (i.e. ensuring installation of a sufficient number of water draw off points 

to increase proximity to homesteads); (iv) Ensuring equal access for men and women to 

capacity building programs and developing gender responsive training and materials; (iv) 

assisting institutions (mainly the Ministry of Ministry Fisheries Water Resources & National 

Assembly Matters and the Department of Community Development) in the sector to 

mainstream gender in their planning and service delivery and to (v) establish partnership with 

organisations working on women and gender issues. 

 

3.2.6.3 There is a potential risk that the women may encounter barriers in accessing leadership 

position in the structures put in place by the project. The need to reduce inequalit ies applies 

also to the issue of access to income-earning opportunities as well as of access to and ownership 

of assets. The mitigation measures will support this change by training in administrative, 

technical and entrepreneur skills for women in order to reduce inequalities and to encourage 

and enable them to take leadership roles. The Project will also support monitoring and 

evaluation information activities that will be disaggregated along gender lines in the reports 

that would be generated. Although women will participate in and benefit from all project 

activities, aggregate funds allocated to their main specific activities are about UA 2.46 million 

(approximately 9 % of the total budget provided by the Bank).  

 

3.2.7 Land Tenure and Access to Land: The Project will be implemented in rural and peri 

urban communities across the five administrative regions in The Gambia. In some areas, it will 

be necessary to remove some structures for communal water supply and sanitation 

infrastructure. However, no involuntary resettlement has been identified and as such planned 

under this Project. All the proposed works for onsite and offsite sustainable sanitary facilities 

will not result in any long term displacement (physical and economic) or prevent access to 

social amenities by the affected households.   The project will ensure a participatory approach 



 

16 

 

with active involvement of social and environmental experts as well as the relevant authorities 

to design out and minimise land uptake during the identification of the beneficiary communities 

and households especially for the onsite and offsite sustainable sanitary facilities. The proposed 

remedial works within the landfill site will take place within the already secured premises of 

an existing landfill site at Bankote, without any displacement to settlements.  

3.2.8  Social Impacts: The project will result in several cultural, socio-economic and health 

benefits. The identified benefits are primarily the improved environmental conditions that 

contribute to reducing incidence of malaria and diarrhoeal diseases (including cholera) and that 

particularly impact under-five mortality. In addition, the improved sanitation systems will 

significantly improve education standards in schools through increased school attendance, high 

pupils/student concentration and early school reporting time, particularly for girl-child 

education. Furthermore, direct employment in construction for both skilled and unskilled 

workers from among the community members with increased income (hence improved socio-

economic status), as well as increased economic activities such as the sale of foodstuffs and 

other essential goods and commodities including water, are among the several benefits 

targeting women, youth and the disabled. 

3.2.9  Skills for Youth and Employment Generation: In line with the Jobs for Youth in 

Africa Strategy (2016-2025) the Bank through the Project will directly contribute to SDG8 on 

inclusive growth through (i) creation of 350 permanent and over 1200 temporary jobs with 

particular attention paid to women (>30%), youth (>30%), in WASH activities and income 

generating ventures, (ii) strengthening human capital through skills improvement in 

construction of sanitation facilities (iii) creating durable labour market with linkages by making 

use of investments in solar powered water supply systems, land fill, septage treatment and solid 

waste collection infrastructure and services. PPP sanitation initiatives will also provide 

opportunities for employment especially for the youth engaged in waste collection and 

recycling ventures to support the improvement in sanitation and hygiene in the beneficiary 

communities and schools. Finally, the Project has provided for fifteen (15) youth 

apprenticeships within the PCU.  

3.3.  Climate Change 

3.3.1 Changes in temperature and rainfall will alter hydrological cycle in The Gambia. The 

combination of global warming, sea level rise, and changes in rainfall pattern and quantity will 

impact the country’s freshwater resources. The steady decline in rainfall over the past decades 

has caused reduced quantity of freshwater flow into the River Gambia, and increased salinity 

in the lowlands and aridity in the uplands. Surface evaporation is expected to increase while 

groundwater recharge capacity will decrease. Higher frequency and severity of extreme 

weather events such as drought and flooding in The Gambia will lead to increasing water 

quantity and quality problems, including salinization in wetland and mangrove ecosystems. 

This situation is compounded by the limited waste management capacity which results in the 

indiscriminate disposal of household and industrial waste which eventually ends up in the water 

bodies, sometimes exacerbating the impact of floods. Reduction in the freshwater flow into the 

River Gambia has increased salt water intrusion into the estuary and its adjacent forest and 

agricultural lands. The reduction in groundwater recharge has also resulted in falling water 

levels and reduced water columns in wells and boreholes.  

3.3.2  The Gambia’s National Adaptation Plan Activities (NAPA) includes ten (10) priority 

projects, four (4) of which are supported by the Gambia Climate Smart WASH Development 

Project, namely: Improvement of Fresh Water Availability; Rehabilitation of Early Warning 



 

17 

 

Systems on Climate-Related Natural Hazards; Reduction of climate change related diseases; 

and Restoration/Protection of coastal environments. In Addition, The Gambia’s Nationally 

Determined Contribution (NDC) highlights waste management.  

3.3.3  Based on the Multilateral Development Banks (MDB) Climate Adaptation Finance 

Tracking Methodology 3-step approach, the Gambia Climate Smart WASH Development 

Project is considered 100% adaptation. i) The climate vulnerability context is clearly stated as 

frequent flooding and droughts based on the NDC and the National Stocktaking Report for the 

NAP3; ii) The project clearly states the intention to address climate vulnerability; iii) Project 

articulates clear link between the climate vulnerability context and specific project activities 

within all the three key project components. The Bank will mobilise external climate co-finance 

from GEF, AF and GCF to finance climate related activities. 

 

3.4  Fragility 

3.4.1 The joint fragility risk and resilience assessment undertaken by the Bank and the World 

Bank in Gambia in May 2017 indicates that the water sector in the Gambia suffers from the 

same inherent challenges faced by the country’s institutions as a whole, including lack of 

transparency, weak capacity and poor governance. Indeed, the country’s deliberately complex 

and opaque regulatory structure has historically made interactions between citizens and the 

state difficult. As such, providing access to basic services, such as water, could help enhance 

the citizen’s confidence towards the state and strengthen the social contract. Furthermore, the 

Gambia’s high vulnerability to multiple forms of environmental damage presents a major 

source of fragility.  

3.4.2  Indeed, while short-term weather-related shocks, combined with long-term climate 

change, is reducing agricultural output, agriculture, in turn, is also putting considerable 

pressure on forests and water resources, in order to meet the demands of a growing population. 

In this context, there is a need to support the country’s public institutions in enforcing 

environmental protections to combat deforestation and desertification in rural areas, while also 

supporting initiatives to control pollution, dispose of solid waste, and provide sanitation 

services to a growing peri-urban population. 

 

IV –  IMPLEMENTATION 

4.1. Implementation arrangements 

4.1.1  The Republic of The Gambia will be the recipient and will ensure the fulfilment of the 

grant conditions. The Ministry of Fisheries, Water Resources and National Matters 

(MFWRNM) will be the executing agency of the Project. Direct implementation and 

management of the project will be undertaken by the Rural Water Supply Division Project 

Coordinating Unit (PCU) established to implement the recently closed AfDB-financed Rural 

Water and Sanitation Project. Using the existing PCU will facilitate familiarisation with AfDB 

procurement and fiduciary regulations, while offering the advantage of general project 

management and technical experience from the previous project. Given the integrated nature 

of the project, the PCU shall co-opt representatives of relevant Government agencies 

(Implementing Partners) including (i) Directorate of Health Promotion and Education of the 

Ministry of Health; (ii) National Water and Electricity Authority (NAWEC); (iii) Department

of Community Development; (iv) Ministry of Education; (v) National Environment Protection 

Agency; (vi) the two area councils of Brikama and Kanifing; and (vii) The Gambia Social 

Development Fund (SDF).  The Implementing Partners shall be supported by the recruited PCU 

technical experts and other specialist advisors.  The agency representatives together with the 

PCU technical experts and advisors shall be responsible for providing the necessary technical 

supervision and quality assurance of consultants and works contractors who will be at the 

forefront of delivering the project goods and services.  A Project Steering Committee (PSC), 

jointly chaired by the Permanent Secretaries of MFEP and MFWRNAM, will provide policy 

oversight and guidance through quarterly meetings or hold extra-ordinary meetings, as 

required, to address special circumstances.  The PSC shall be the ultimate forum for dialogue 

with the Bank’s supervision missions. The PCU Coordinator, in consultation with the head of 

the Rural Water Department, will be the PSC Secretariat, and shall be answerable to the 

Permanent Secretary of the MFWRNAM.  The organisational structure and details of 

implementation responsibilities, including the Terms of Reference for the PCU technical 

assistants, are included in Technical Annexes B3 and C6. 

4.1.2  The staff of the existing PCU have experience in managing previous donor funded 

projects including the recently completed Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project. The PCU 

currently maintains three (3) professional staff (Coordinator, Financial Management 

Accountant, and M&E Specialist), and 2 assistants (FM and administration) who actively 

participated in the preparation and appraisal of this project. The PCU will be strengthened with 

additional expertise to meet project implementation requirements.  Henceforth, provision is 

made for six (6) additional technical assistants including the following: Water Resources/Water 

Supply Engineer, Sanitary Engineering Specialist, Environment/Climate Change officer, 

Procurement Officer, Asst. Project Accountant and Community Development/Gender 

Specialist. All PCU personnel shall have performance-based contracts to be renewed on an 

annual basis depending on performance and need.  The PCU will be supported by international 

technical specialists who will be attached to partner implementing agencies.  The technical 

specialists will ensure that the work done by consultants is of appropriate technical quality in 

addition to ensuring value for money in construction contracts. 

4.1.3  The PCU will be responsible for the day-to-day implementation of the project 

including preparation and submission of the Quarterly Progress Reports, interim Quarterly 

Financial Reports and Annual Audit reports of the project to the Bank. The PCU is also 

responsible for all project related monitoring and evaluation activities, gender mainstreaming 

and social accountability, compliance with environmental and social safeguards, compliance 

with Bank and national procurement requirements, and adequate financial management and 

control. Furthermore, Technical and other specialist services under the project scope shall be 

provided by experienced Engineering and other specialty Consulting Firms, Individuals, NGOs 

and service providers.  

Procurement Arrangements 

4.1.4 The utilization of Borrower Procurement Systems (BPS) will not apply to this project.  

Procurement Risks and Capacity Assessment (PRCA) at Country, Sector, and Project levels 

were undertaken and the output have informed the decisions on the procurement regimes 

adopted for the transactions under the project. The appropriate risks mitigation measures have 

been included in the procurement PRCA action plan proposed in Annex B5. 

4.1.5 Procurement of goods, works and the acquisition of consultancy services financed by 

the Bank for the project, will be carried out in accordance with the “Procurement Policy and 



 

19 

 

Methodology for Bank Group Funded Operations” (BPM), dated October 2015 and following 

the provisions stated in the procurement plan and relevant financing agreements. Bank standard 

PMPs, using the relevant Bank Standard Solicitation Documents (SSDs), will be used for 

International Competitive Bidding (ICB), National Competitive Bidding (NCB) and Shopping 

contracts for both goods and works and acquisition of consulting services as indicated in the 

Technical Annex B5.  

Financial Management and Disbursement Arrangements 

4.1.6  Financial Management: The PCU established by the Rural Water Supply Division 

(RWD) will have responsibility to implement the project’s led components including overall 

responsibility for financial control. Thus, the PCU is familiar with donor FM requirements for 

projects and has satisfactorily conducted its fiduciary responsibility for Bank financed Rural 

Water Supply and Sanitation Project (RWSSP). The PCU will continue to use its FinEx 

accounting software for accounting and reporting as well as its Financial Management and 

Policy Manual which informs and guides the operations of its fiduciary environment. In 

addition, accounting migration to Government managed IFMIS module for projects will be in 

parallel use. The proposed project is expected to recruit the Social Development Fund (SDF) 

Micro Finance Institution to implement elements of component activities relating to Micro 

Finance which was established through a previous Bank operation. SDF is an autonomous 

government parastatal incorporated by Government with a mandate to manage microfinance 

resources on behalf of government and donors. The SDF will manage project resources in 

accordance with specific terms of reference for a management fee using SDF internal financial 

management and operation administration procedures/regulations. Details of the procedures 

for fund management are presented in Technical Annexes B3 & B4. 

 

4.1.7 Disbursement: The use of Direct Payment and Special Account methods of payment 
will be available for use in the proposed project. A revolving fund special account will be 

opened to defray authorized eligible expenses as follows: 

 

 PCU managed special accounts for operations costs; and 
 SDF managed special account for Micro Finance elements 

 

Processing of eligible payments would be managed by authorized signatories at PMU and SDF. 

Advances and subsequent replenishments to the special accounts will be based on adequate 

justification provided for prior advances. Opening of the special accounts is a condition for 

disbursement and all disbursement will follow Bank’s disbursement procedures. 

 

4.1.8 Reporting: PMU will report progress on a quarterly basis to the AFDB showing 
specific progress on activities implemented and financial utilization reports. In addition Interim 

Unaudited Financial Reports showing sources and usage of funds should be produced and 

submitted to the Bank within 30 days following the end of every calendar quarter.  

 

4.1.9 Audit: The proposed Project will be audited by an independent audit firm acceptable 
to the Bank. The audit will be conducted annually using the Bank audit TOR and submitted 

within six months following the year audited.  

 

4.1.10 The overall FM risk assessment concluded that FM capacity and proposed arrangement 
will provide reasonable assurance to ensure: (a) that project funds are used only for the intended 

purposes in an efficient and economical way; (b) the preparation of accurate, reliable and timely 



 

20 

 

periodic and annual financial reports; (c) that any assets purchased using project funds are 

adequately safeguarded. The project FM Risk is moderate. 

4.2.  Monitoring  

4.2.1  Project monitoring will be undertaken at national and local levels as appropriate, with 

the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) shouldering the overall responsibility under the direction 

of the M&E Technical Assistant. The PCU will prepare and provide project activity, output 

and outcome monitoring tools for all relevant national and local level stakeholders involved in 

project implementation, including MDFT/VDCs, District and Town Councils, NAWEC, 

National Environment Protection Agency, Rural Water Department, Ministry of Health and 

Social Welfare/Directorate of Health Promotion and Education, Department of Community 

Development, SDF, Consultants, Contractors and all other project goods and services 

providers.  The PCU staff will follow-up to ensure regular and timely collection of data, analyse 

and consolidate all the routinely collected data for purposes of preparing the Quarterly Progress 

Reports, Mid-Term Review report and Project Completion Report.  Impact assessments will 

be undertaken in collaboration with the Gambia Bureau of Statistics (GBOS). Project results 

will be gender disaggregated and shall as much as possible be attributed to the ADF, GEF, GCF 

and AF financing.  The PCU will ensure timely submission of Quarterly Progress Reports, as 

well as the MTR report and PCR to the Bank.   The project will also facilitate the preparation 

of Annual Sector Performance reports and convening of Annual Joint Sector Reviews (ASRs) 

in liaison with co-financiers and other development partners. Provision of UA193,000 

(GMD13.24million) is made in the project budget for covering monitoring costs, including 

M&E technical assistance costs and ESMF implementation monitoring costs. Details of 

procedure and responsibilities for undertaking monitoring of project results are presented in 

Technical Annex B.3. 

 

4.2.2 The Bank will undertake supervision, MTR and PCR missions.   At least two 

supervision missions will be undertaken every year, in addition to one desk supervision 

mission. Project Mid-Term Review will be undertaken during the third year of implementation.  

The PCR mission will be undertaken after completion of all the project activities. Impact 

assessments to evaluate immediate outcomes will be undertaken to inform the MTR and PCR 

missions.  The Bank’s standard Implementation Progress and Results (IPR) report will be 

prepared at the end of each mission for Bank management’s feed-back and integration of results 

within the Bank-wide performance measurement framework.  Knowledge and lessons will be 

shared at the Annual Joint Sector Reviews and the Bank’s Water and Sanitation Department 

Learning Week, as well as at other relevant sector events at international level.  

 

4.2.3 The tools to be developed by the project include a web-based WASH services 

Monitoring & Evaluation tool that will be used in monitoring of the project results and overall 

sector performance.  The M&E tool is generally intended to put in place an effective 

mechanism for the monitoring of sector results and achievements, including the effective 

tracking of the SDG #6 progress, which is hitherto an enormous challenge to the Government 

of The Gambia.  Therefore the tool will be accessible to all relevant national and local sector 

stakeholders; the tool shall include an interface for public information. 

4.3.  Governance 

4.3.1  Over the past five years, The Gambia has experienced a broad-based deterioration in 

governance. Gambia CPIA score decreased by 13% from 3.43 in 2012 to 2.97 in 2016, which 



 

21 

 

is far below the Africa region score of 3.50. In the 2016 Ibrahim Index of African Governance 

(IIAG), The Gambia ranked 35th out of 54 countries in Africa. The Gambia is also one of five 

countries in Africa that have shown deterioration in all measures of the IIAG over the period, 

particularly regarding ‘safety & rule of law’ and ‘participation and human rights’. 

Transparency International’s 2016 corruption perception index ranked The Gambia 145 out of 

176 countries. Corruption is further aggravated by its widespread acceptance and the 

judiciary’s lack of independence. After years of a culture of intolerance, the public 

administration is weak, as many qualified people have left public service or emigrated.  In order 

to safeguard the project against the potential risks of weak public administration, the project 

will not use country systems for procurement and financial management. 

4.3.2  In the above context, the Project will ensure institutional, financial and social 

accountability by (i) using and strengthening an existing PCU to provide sound project 

implementation and coordination on behalf of the Ministry of Fisheries, Water Resources and 

National Assembly Matters; the PCU shall be supported by TA consultants to complement 

their capability as needed in technical design and reviews, procurement, contract management, 

social and environmental accountability; and (ii) putting in place a customer/citizen’s 

complaints and feedback mechanism to ensure social accountability; the project will provide 

opportunity for beneficiaries to be heard and to address complaints as promptly as possible. 

The mechanism will also be used as a tool to guide impact evaluation. 

4.4. Sustainability  

4.4.1 The Government of The Gambia accords high priority to the WASH sector. “Health 

Nutrition and Sanitation” is a Strategic Priority of the National Development Plan (2018-

2021) for which universal access to safely managed water supply and 75% access to safe 

sanitation are cited as a key results.  The Government has therefore prioritized the proposed 

project for its ADF-14 allocation. This commitment is buttressed by the consistent attention 

towards development of sector specific and relevant policies and regulations since 2005.  The 

effort has resulted in the policy documents and guidelines that include: National Water 

Resources Policy Framework (2006), National Water Policy (2007), the National Sanitation 

Policy (2010), National Strategy for Sanitation and Hygiene (2011 – 2016), National Water 

Resources Management Agency Bill (2017) and National Meteorological Agency Bill (2017), 

The Operation and Maintenance Manual for Rural Water Supplies (2015), the Local Councils’ 

Strategic Sanitation and Action Plans,  among others.  

4.4.2 Social sustainability will be enhanced through the adoption of value chain/IWRM 

approach to WASH services provision, which combines the provision of water and sanitation, 

community sensitization and mobilization, and participatory planning and decision making, as 

well as providing opportunities for employment and income within the respective WASH and 

related value chains as a means of strengthening community ownership and commitment to 

sustain outcomes. Provision is therefore made for WASH committees under the respective 

VDCs to lead the village level implementation effort. In addition, the beneficiary communities 

will be responsible for providing land and communal labour for some construction activities 

such as trenching for service connections.  The project provides for establishment of 

partnership between the VDCs and a rural water supply services revenue collection services 

provider to ensure O&M cost recovery. Viability of cost recovery is enhanced by the adoption 

of solar powered pumping for which O&M costs are considerably much lower.  In addition, 

the project’s emphasis on promoting of youth and women’s gainful involvement, through 

nurturing water and sanitation value chain based SMEs, provides good ground for enhancing 

the ability to pay for water and sanitation services which is a critical factor for sustainability.  



 

22 

 

The project also provides for the establishment of partnerships between Town Councils and 

local private transport associations which effectively transfers the challenge and risks of 

ownership and operation of waste transportation equipment to the private sector.  The private 

operators are in a better position to effectively mitigate the risks which undermine the Town 

councils’ ability to sustainably own and operate waste transportation equipment.  Overall, 

sustainability is strengthened by the IWRM approach to project design which underscores 

sector stakeholder coordination and relevant human resources capacity building, as well as 

waste re-use and aquatic environment sustainability.

4.6.  Knowledge building 

4.6.1  The project is designed based on an innovative approach that combines support to (i) 

supply safe water from renewable sources, (ii) improve national and local level capacity for 

better environmental and water resources management, and (iii) improve livelihoods through 

support for small businesses and individuals. Related project activities provide opportunity to 

generate knowledge products for future project design across the Gambia and the region, given 

the project support for studies to develop business models that cover (i) Private Sector and 

NGO participation in (a) operation and maintenance of rural and peri-urban water supply 

systems, (b) solid and liquid waste collection and re-use, and (c) management of municipal 

waste treatment infrastructure; (ii) provision of  seed microcredit financing household 

sanitation through the existing Social Development Fund (SDF).  

4.6.2  Study tours, peer-to-peer learning and participation in regional sector learning events 

as well as academic training shall be supported to better equip primary beneficiaries and sector 

staff in relevant public institutions with core knowledge, best practices and innovation in the 

water and sanitation sector. The knowledge and lessons from the project’s innovations will be 

shared at the Annual Joint Sector Review meetings and at other regional sector seminars, 



 

23 

 

including those organised by the Bank and other continental or global WASH initiatives. The 

Bank’s Water and Sanitation department’s Knowledge and Learning Week will be the primary 

forum for sharing the knowledge within the Bank.
