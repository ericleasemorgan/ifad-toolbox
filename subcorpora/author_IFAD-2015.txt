Recommendation for approval

The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
financing to the Republic of Liberia for the Rural Community Finance Project as
contained in paragraph 45.

Proposed loan and grant to the Republic of Liberia for the
Rural Community Finance Project

I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1. Despite significant improvements since the end of its civil war, Liberia remains a

fragile state with weak institutions, policies and governance. The outbreak of Ebola
virus disease has further constrained Liberia’s limited institutional capacity and
impacted its economy, threatening post-war gains. Liberia is classified as a Least
Developed Country and a Low-Income Food-Deficit Country,1 and relies heavily on
foreign assistance. The gross national income per capita was US$400 in 20142 and,
according to the 2014 Human Development Index, increased by 68.2 per cent
between 2000 and 2013. With a 2013 Human Development Index score of 0.412,
Liberia ranked 175 out of 187 countries in human development.

2. According to United Nations statistics, the population is estimated at 4.4 million
with an annual growth rate of 2.6 per cent. Liberia has a large youth population: in
2013, 42.9 per cent of the population was estimated to be less than 14 years old.
Poverty is widespread in Liberia, and is particularly acute in rural areas. An
estimated 51 per cent of the population lives in rural areas where poverty is heavily
concentrated, and a high percentage lack access to basic infrastructure and social
services, with poor road conditions leaving many areas inaccessible. Approximately
55 per cent of rural Liberian households are food insecure.3

3. The agricultural sector is the primary source of livelihood for 48.9 per cent of the
active population – mainly in smallholder and subsistence farming. There are also
cash-crop plantations including rubber, cocoa, coffee, palm oil and sugar cane.
Although agriculture is the largest contributor of GDP, small-scale farmers are
among the poorest in the country. Liberia has signed the Comprehensive Africa
Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP) Compact, committing to the Maputo
Protocol goal of 10 per cent national budget expenditure on agriculture by 2017
(the current level is 3 per cent of the national budget). As a result of low
agricultural production and productivity, Liberia imports between 50 per cent and
60 per cent of its staple food requirements, leaving the country vulnerable to price
fluctuations in global markets.

B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and RB-
COSOP

4. IFAD’s results-based country strategic opportunities programme (RB-COSOP) for
Liberia for the period 2011-2015 is aligned with the CAADP and national policies,
especially the Liberia Agriculture Sector Investment Program. Three
IFAD-supported projects are currently contributing to the RB-COSOP: (i) the
Agriculture Sector Rehabilitation Project; (ii) the Smallholder Tree Crop

1 Low-Income Food-Deficit Countries list for 2014, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.
2 World Bank World Development Indicators: gross national income per capita, Atlas Method (Current US$).
3 Liberia Comprehensive Food Security and Nutrition Survey, June 2013.



EB 2015/LOT/P.37/Rev.1

2

Revitalization and Support Project; and (iii) the support to the Farmers’ Union
Network.

5. As the Liberia RB-COSOP reached its midway point, its performance and relevance
were reviewed to identify the way forward for future IFAD support under the 2013-
2015 performance-based allocation system. The findings of the 2013 review
revealed that the strategic objectives under the RB-COSOP continue to be relevant,
with the provision that the transition from an emergency situation to a development
approach is realized. The needs and priorities of smallholder farmers and their
organizations are changing. Their growing interest in investing in agriculture and in
other microenterprises and small business is generating greater demand for credit
and will necessitate better access to rural finance. This demand has been
recognized in government efforts to promote growth in the local economy and
reduce poverty in the long term. The Government’s interest in building the rural
finance sector has been mirrored by the CBL. With the current RB-COSOP set to
end in 2015, the new RB-COSOP will require a stronger focus on rural finance.

II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
6. Project area. The project will facilitate the creation of new rural community

finance institutions (RCFIs) in selected areas throughout the country. RCFI locations
will be identified through feasibility studies and criteria including the degree of
commitment by host communities, absence of banking facilities and viability. CBL’s
strategic goals and objectives will also be taken into account. Priority will be given
to locations with significant business potential, including central towns with high
demand for financial services. The project area will also include all locations with
existing RCFIs.

7. Although the project will be nationwide in scope (excluding urban Montserrado
county), its coverage may initially be divided into implementation clusters. At the
district or county level, the following criteria will be used to identify suitable
communities: (i) social, poverty and demographic indicators for identifying
vulnerable communities with high potential; (ii) complementarities with ongoing
and planned initiatives; (iii) the potential for commercial activity, including the
production of cocoa and coffee, and value addition; (iv) the potential for poverty
reduction and employment creation; (v) the potential for mobilization of shares and
savings; and (vi) demand for financial services, particularly among low-income
groups.

8. Target group. The primary target group will be the economically active rural
population: petty traders, smallholder farmers, food processors, local transporters,
craftsmen, artisans and ex-combatants. Special attention will be given to reaching
women and youth, and small-scale entrepreneurs, especially women. As a project
designed to improve access to rural finance, targeting will be inclusive: by virtue of
the fact that the RCFIs will be community-owned, access to the financial services
will be open to the entire community. The project will directly target 24,000
shareholders, at least 50 per cent of them women, and 25 per cent of them young
men and women.

9. The proposed project will complement ongoing initiatives through partnerships to
maximize the impact on the target group. This includes partnerships with farmers’
organizations supported by existing projects that show interest in financial services.

B. Project development objective
10. The overall development goal of the project is to reduce rural poverty and

household food insecurity on a sustainable basis by facilitating access to finance for
at least 24,000 rural individuals and their families. The project’s development
objective is to improve access to rural financial services on a sustainable basis,



EB 2015/LOT/P.37/Rev.1

3

enabling the development of the rural sector. This project development objective
will be assessed through three indicators, namely that at least: (i) 20 per cent of
the adult rural population (over 16 years) in the project area uses the financial
services of RCFIs supported by the project; (ii) 50 per cent of RCFI shareholders
have received at least one loan; and (iii) 75 per cent of RCFIs supported by the
project achieve 100 per cent operational self-sufficiency (OSS) by the project end.

C. Components/outcomes
11. This five-year project will aim to enhance access to sustainable and affordable rural

financial services in Liberia. The three main outcomes of the project are that: (i)
RCFIs deliver demand-driven and efficient financial services to their clients; (ii)
professional and efficient technical support and supervision services are provided to
RCFIs by an apex body – the Technical Assistance and Supervision Unit/Technical
Assistance and Supervision Company (TASU/TASC)4 and; (iii) a more conducive
regulatory and supervisory environment promotes the rural financial sector. The
project will comprise three components: (i) Rural financial services; (ii) Enabling
environment for rural finance; and (iii) Project management and coordination.

12. Rural financial services. This component includes three subcomponents:
(i) direct support in the creation of 10 RCFIs and extended support to nine existing
RCFIs with support from CBL and a commercial bank; (ii) creation of a TASU/TASC
within CBL to implement the subcomponent 1.1 and support RCFIs; and (iii) a
country-specific grant to mitigate the impacts of the Ebola virus disease outbreak.
Given negative impacts of Ebola virus disease on household incomes, earning
capacity, financial and other reserves, and saving capacity, IFAD will support the
recovery of existing RCFIs and the establishment of new ones with US$0.5 million.

13. Enabling environment for rural finance. This component will provide technical
assistance to CBL for developing a sound regulatory framework for deposit-taking
and credit-only financial institutions. There will be a focus on rationalizing Liberia’s
the regulatory environment, including policies and reporting formats for RCFIs,
microfinance institutions (MFIs) and credit unions. This will be achieved in an open
manner that ensures stakeholder participation.

14. Project management and coordination. Component 3, comprising
project-related coordination, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), reporting, financial
management and procurement oversight, will be undertaken by the programme
implementation unit (PIU) operating under the supervision of the programme
management unit (PMU) within the Ministry of Agriculture. The PMU is responsible
for the coordination and harmonization of all donor-funded agricultural projects.

III. Project implementation
A. Approach
15. The institutional design of the project is simple: the existence of a centralized PIU

for all Ministry of Agriculture projects supported by IFAD makes it possible to
coordinate the rural finance activities assigned to TASU/TASC and CBL. The main
institutional responsibilities comprise: (i) implementation of all grass-roots activities
under component 1 by TASU/TASC; (ii) implementation of component 2 activities,
which are related to CBL’s core mandate, by CBL; (iii) PIU implementation of all
activities related to its mandate (see paragraph 19); and (iv) guidance on major
issues, which will be provided by a project steering committee (PSC).

4 The TASU will be established within the Central Bank of Liberia and will develop over time until
deemed sufficiently strong for transformation into an independent company (TASC), providing services
to member institutions in exchange for a fee.



EB 2015/LOT/P.37/Rev.1

4

16. TASU/TASC and CBL will share responsibility for implementation. This complies with
the international consensus that central banks’ project interventions should be
limited to activities clearly related to their primary mandates. In this case,
regulation and supervision of financial institutions fall under the mandate of CBL.
Memorandums of agreement will be signed by the PIU, TASU/TASC and CBL.
Memorandums of agreement will also be signed by TASU/TASC and each affiliated
RCFI.

B. Organizational framework
17. The project will operate under the guidance of a PSC composed of representatives

from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning,
and CBL. The PSC will provide project oversight, approve all manuals and revisions,
approve the annual workplan and budget before its submission to IFAD, receive
draft annual reports and decide on major issues. According to PIU implementation
guidelines, all sector-specific projects must have their own PSC with the necessary
technical requirements and expertise.

18. The PMU was established under the supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture and is
affiliated with that ministry’s Department of Planning and Development . The PMU is
a shared unit in charge of implementing all donor-funded projects in the agricultural
sector. The PMU is responsible for overall coordination of activities and information
exchange among partners, ministries and other stakeholders, and for ensuring
synergy among the project implementation units of the various donors.

19. Within the PMU, the IFAD PIU in Monrovia is responsible for the implementation of
all IFAD-funded projects in Liberia related to agriculture. The mandate of the PIU
comprises: project accounting, withdrawals, consolidating annual workplans and
budgets, preparing annual reports, corresponding with government authorities on
issues related to the financing agreement (excluding technical implementation),
documentation, procurement, submitting reports to IFAD and other agencies, M&E,
supervision of support and midterm review (MTR) missions, impact assessment and
end-of-project evaluation.

C. Planning, monitoring and evaluation, and learning and
knowledge management

20. A system to integrate planning, M&E, and knowledge management will be
developed at start-up to: (i) provide stakeholders with the data required to steer
implementation; (ii) provide the Ministry of Agriculture and other stakeholders with
information on progress in order to measure the project’s success in increasing
access to finance and other indicators; (iii) support coordination and synergies with
other development projects; (iv) monitor the project’s success in building
participatory processes that ensure the full involvement of rural poor people;
(v) provide participating communities and RCFIs with regular feedback and
analytics; and (vi) provide information on the achievement of RB-COSOP targets.
The PIU will manage this system in collaboration with partners.

B. Financial management, procurement and governance
21. Country context and risk rating. The inherent risk in Liberia is assessed as

medium. Liberia’s Corruption Perceptions Index score has decreased slightly from
41 in 2012 to 38 in 2013 and to 37 in 2014. According to the latest IMF Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment conducted in 2012, Liberia’s
Government has made significant improvements since the 2007 assessment, but
the overall state of the public financial management remains somewhat weak. As
part of the project design, a financial management assessment of the PIU
responsible for implementing existing IFAD projects was undertaken. The
assessment found that the existing PIU’s financial management arrangements and
capacity are adequate to meet IFAD requirements. However, since the financial



EB 2015/LOT/P.37/Rev.1

5

management arrangements of the main implementing partner TASU/TASC are not
yet in place, the initial risk rating was determined to be medium.

22. Financial management. The main responsibility for the project’s financial
management will rest with the PIU. The PIU will maintain a full set of accounts
according to IFAD’s requirements and internationally accepted accounting
standards. The PIU will prepare periodic interim financial reports and annual project
financial statements according to accounting standards acceptable to IFAD. All
financial management arrangements will be detailed by the PIU in a financial
procedures manual or equivalent guideline to be approved by the Fund.

23. Flow of funds. There will be two designated bank accounts in United States dollars
held by CBL – one for the IFAD loan and one for the IFAD grant. In addition, two
operating accounts in United States dollars in a commercial bank acceptable to
IFAD will receive funds from the designated accounts. There will also be an
operating account to receive government counterpart funds. Once the IFAD
financing has entered into force, IFAD will make an initial deposit into the
designated accounts equal to the requirements of six months of implementation
(authorized allocation). IFAD financing will be disbursed following certified
withdrawal applications in accordance with IFAD disbursement procedures, which
will be specified in the letter to the borrower.

24. Procurement. Procurement for the project will be carried out according to national
procedures as long as they comply with IFAD guidelines. By default, the project will
utilize the procurement committee established within the Ministry of Agriculture’s
PIU.

25. Audit arrangements. The PIU will appoint independent auditors acceptable to
IFAD under terms of reference cleared by IFAD and in line with IFAD’s guidelines for
project audits. An audited annual consolidated financial statement for the entire
project together with a management letter on audit observations of internal
controls shall be submitted to the Fund within six months of each fiscal year end.

D. Supervision
26. The project will be directly supervised by IFAD. Annual supervision missions,

including follow-up missions whenever needed, will be organized with the
participation of the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Finance and Development
Planning, CBL, TASU/TASC, RCFIs and beneficiaries. Supervision will not be
conducted as general inspections, but as opportunities to assess achievements and
lessons learned, and to reflect on how to improve implementation and impact.
Missions will be an integral part of the knowledge management cycle, with mission
members supporting project and implementing agencies’ staff.

IV. Project costs, financing and benefits
A. Project costs
27. The total investment and incremental recurrent costs, including price and physical

contingencies, are estimated at US$10,860,000; contingencies account for
3 per cent of these costs. The foreign exchange component is estimated at
US$3,006,000 (28 per cent). Taxes represent US$404,000. The total base cost is
US$10,426,000 while price and other contingencies account for US$434,000.
Significant contributions will be made by beneficiary communities (purchase of
shares), RCFIs (contributions to operating costs of RCFIs and TASU/TASC) and CBL
(staff time). The total costs by component and subcomponent are summarized by
financier in table 1 below.

28. The base cost of component 1 – Rural financial services – represents an investment
of US$9.7 million (93 per cent of the total base cost) while component 2 – Enabling
environment for rural finance, accounts for US$313,000 (3 per cent of the total



EB 2015/LOT/P.37/Rev.1

6

base cost). Project management and coordination under component 3 account for
4 per cent of the base cost, or US$417,000.

B. Project financing
29. The project will be financed by the Government, IFAD, CBL, RCFIs and their clients.

IFAD will finance 55 per cent of the project costs through a loan on highly
concessional terms to the Government of US$5.5 million and a grant of
US$0.49 million. The RCFI contribution to operating costs is estimated at
US$1.1 million (11 per cent) and the shareholders’ contribution to share capital is
estimated at US$3.2 million (30 per cent). For the first 30 months, CBL will house
the TASU/TASC and provide a manager, with a total cost of US$0.09 million
(1 per cent). The Government’s contribution will be in the form of waived taxes and
duties on imported and local goods and services as per standard regulations for
IFAD funding (US$0.4 million, representing 4 per cent of the total cost). Total cost
financing arrangements by category of expenses are summarized in the table 2
below.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
30. The project will generate a wide range of direct benefits for: (i) approximately

24,000 shareholders and users, and their household members; (ii) RCFIs; and
(iii) the economies of the communities where RCFIs will be located. At the macro
level, the project will bring informal financial transactions into the formal sector and
make decentralized rural financial institutions more viable. The Government will
benefit from additional tax revenues payable by the RCFIs. The entire country will
benefit from a strengthened network of financial institutions, through which
remittances and transfers can be made from within and outside the country. Finally,
the country will benefit from higher confidence in the financial sector, especially in
rural areas, as a result of the improved regulatory framework and supervisory
systems under the guidance of the CBL. Other macro-level benefits are not
quantifiable using classical methods of economic and financial analysis, such as
increased deposits in formal financial institutions, higher confidence in the formal
financial sector and a larger network for transfers and payments.

31. Total project benefits are expected to increase from US$50,050 in year 1, to
US$2.71 million in year 5, and will remain at approximately US$2.8 million during
years 7-15. The economic analysis shows that the project will generate an
economic rate of return (ERR) of 17 per cent over a 15-year period, with a net
present value of US$5.5 million. Given that many of its benefits are not
quantifiable, the actual ERR will likely be higher. Sensitivity analysis shows that in
the event of adverse factors, the ERR is relatively robust with regard to higher
costs, lower benefits and time lags.

32. The highest contribution to the ERR derives from investments made by borrowers
from RCFIs. The number of investments is constrained by the number of RCFIs
created. The number of RCFIs that can be created through the project is likewise



EB 2015/LOT/P.37/Rev.1

8

constrained by the funding available for financial and technical support. There is a
potential to increase the number of new RCFIs beyond the 10 for which funding is
available. If additional funds are provided, the ERR will be higher than the projected
17 per cent.

D. Sustainability
33. The project will support the creation of 10 new RCFIs and consolidate the nine

existing ones. The detailed projections, which are based on conservative
assumptions, show that the new RCFIs will break even in years 3 or 4 without
project support, and in years 1, 2 or 3 with project support. Two years are needed
to mobilize a sufficient number of shareholders and depositors, an adequate volume
of shares and deposits, and to disburse a sufficient number of loans with good
repayment performance. The learning curves for administrative procedures (in the
first three months) and loan management (in months six to twelve) are expected to
be steep. The sustainability of access to financial services will also improve as
RCFIs mature since they are likely to attract more customers over time. This will
create additional benefits for the economy.

34. The projections for this project compare well with the results of the Rural Finance
and Community Improvement Programme, a similar initiative in neighbouring
Sierra Leone that is also based on the Rural Community Finance Project concept.
Out of the 51 financial service associations created, 41 (or 80 per cent) had an OSS
of 100 per cent at project end. Out of 17 newly created community banks, 14 (82
per cent) had an OSS of 100 per cent at project end.

35. The projections for TASC show that this apex body of RCFIs will be able to generate
income from audit services and from fee-based support services. The resulting
income will cover related operating expenses in a progressive manner, from
0 per cent in year 1 to 26 per cent in year 5. This result will largely depend on the
quality of services, which in turn depends on the volume of shares and deposits,
and the number of RCFIs included in the TASC. If the number of RCFIs increases,
the sustainability of TASC will improve accordingly. However, this depends on the
availability of funding.

E. Risk identification and mitigation
36. The main risks related to project implementation include: (i) competition from

subsidized credit programmes; (ii) caps on interest rates; (iii) a lack of interest
from local communities; (iv) the reluctance of CBL to delegate supervision authority
to TASC; and (v) weak cooperation from the microfinance sector in efforts to
improve regulatory frameworks. Adequate risk mitigation measures have been
introduced, and the residual risk ratings after risk mitigation are rated as low or
moderate.

V. Corporate considerations
A. Compliance with IFAD policies
37. The project design is aligned with IFAD’s: (i) Strategic Framework 2011-2015;

(ii) Policy on Targeting Policy (2006); (iii) Policy on Gender Equality and Women’s
Empowerment; (iv) Rural Finance Policy; (v) Private-Sector Strategy; (vi) Rural
Enterprise Policy; (vii) Policy on Supervision and Implementation Support;
(viii) Climate Change Strategy (2010); (ix) Environment and Natural Resource
Management Policy (2012); and (x) Environmental and Social Assessment
Procedures.

B. Alignment and harmonization
38. Strategy for financial inclusion. With its 2009 Liberian Strategy for Financial

Inclusion (2009-2013), the Government aims to create an inclusive financial
environment by enabling open access to financial services. The overall objective of
inclusive finance is to establish viable microfinance providers that facilitate



EB 2015/LOT/P.37/Rev.1

9

micro-entrepreneurs’ sustained access to a diverse range of financial services. In
order to enhance sustainability, efficiency, outreach and good governance, financial
service providers will receive assistance from various actors, including CBL. The
strategy for financial inclusion will work at three levels: (i) establishing sustainable
microfinance providers at the micro level; (ii) building a supportive infrastructure at
the intermediate level; and (iii) creating an enabling policy and regulatory
environment at the macro level.

39. CBL has recently begun drafting the new Liberian Strategy for Financial Inclusion
2014-2018. Its vision is to build a sustainable financial sector that provides access
to and enhances the use of a wide range of affordable financial services in Liberia.
Its objectives are to: deliver financial services; enhance access to finance,
particularly credit; integrate the informal sector into the formal economy; improve
the environment for small and medium-sized enterprises; enhance financial
literacy; and improve consumer protection. These objectives have been
consolidated in a plan of action, which places the responsibility for establishing
RCFIs with CBL, the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, and one
commercial bank.

C. Innovations and scaling up
40. Several of the approaches adopted by this project are innovative: the creation of a

new type of financial institution in Liberia builds on the experience of several other
West African countries. Other innovations include the creation of an apex body to
support RCFIs, the biometric identification of shareholders in order to offer new
products at reduced costs, and the emulation of indigenous rural finance practices.
The project is in itself part of IFAD’s scaling-up process in West Africa following the
Rural Finance and Community Improvement Project in Sierra Leone. Upon the
successful trial of the implementation model, it will be possible to increase the
number of RCFIs beyond those created in Liberia through this project.

D. Policy engagement
41. Liberia’s microfinance sector does not have the clear regulations needed for its

development. One project component (under CBL supervision) is exclusively aimed
at developing a new legal framework for this sector and training actors on the new
regulations and reporting formats.

VI. Legal instruments and authority
42. A project financing agreement between the Republic of Liberia and IFAD will

constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the
borrower/recipient. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as
appendix 1.

43. The Republic of Liberia is empowered under its laws to receive financing from IFAD.

44. I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.

Schedule 1

Project Description and Implementation Arrangements

I. Project Description

1. Goal. The overall development goal of the Project is to reduce rural poverty and
household food insecurity on a sustainable basis.

2. Objective.  The objective of the Project is to improve access to rural financial services
on a sustainable basis, enabling the development of the rural sector. It shall focus on
expanding and consolidating the model established in neighbouring Sierra Leone under the
IFAD-supported Rural Finance and Community Improvement Project (RFCIP) which
achieved good results in the creation of new and the rehabilitation of existing rural financial
institutions.

3. Target group. The Project shall benefit the economically active rural population
(petty traders, smallholder farmers, food processors, local transporters, craftsmen and
artisans, as well as ex-combatants) who demonstrate an interest and willingness to expand
their economic activities. Special attention will be given to women and youth in both on-
farm and off-farm activities, and micro- and small-scale entrepreneurs, particularly
women.

4. Activities. The Project is geared at enhancing access to sustainable and affordable
rural financial services in Liberia. Specifically, the three main outcomes are: (i) Rural
Community Finance Institutions (RCFIs) deliver demand-driven and efficient financial
services to their clients; (ii) professional and efficient technical support and supervision
services are rendered by an apex body (TASU/TASC) to RCFIs, and; (iii) a more
conducive regulatory and supervisory environment promotes the rural financial sector.
The Project will initially aim at strengthening existing RCFIs. New RCFIs will only be
created once an initial feasibility study has been conducted by TASU and its results are
validated by the Steering Committee. A joint review of the performance of existing RCFIs
conducted by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Central Bank of
Liberia will be completed at the beginning of the Project.

5. Components.  The Project will consist of three Components, (i) Rural Financial
Services: RCFI creation and operation; technical assistance and supervision; IFAD grant
to mitigate the effect of the Ebola Virus Disease outbreak; (ii) Enabling Environment for
Rural Finance, and; (iii) Project Management and Coordination.

II. Implementation Arrangements

1. Lead Project Agency. The LPA shall be the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) of the
Republic of Liberia, with overall responsibility for the implementation of the Project.

2. Project Management. The MoA shall delegate the functional and day-to-day
implementation and coordination responsibilities for the Project to the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU), responsible for the implementation of all IFAD-financed
projects in Liberia.

3. The main institutional parameters shall be as follows:  (a) Implementation of all
grassroots operations under Component 1 will be exclusively vested with the
TASU/TASC; (b) the implementation of activities related to the CBL’s core mandate will
be exclusively implemented by CBL; (c) beyond this, no implementation unit is required;
(d) the central PIU shall take care of all activities pertaining to its defined mandate; (e) a
Project Steering Committee (PSC) will be established to provide guidance on all major
issues.



Appendix I EB 2015/LOT/P.37/Rev.1

5

4. Project Steering Committee.  The Project shall operate under the guidance of a
Project Steering Committee (PSC) composed of representatives of the MOA, Ministry of
Finance & Development Planning (MFDP) and the CBL. It will provide oversight over the
Project, approve all relevant manuals and their changes, approve Annual Work Plan and
Budgets before submission to IFAD, receive draft annual reports and take decisions over
major issues.

5. Component Implementation.  Project implementation will be vested with two
institutions, the TASU/TASC and the CBL. The TASU/TASC will be fully responsible for
Component 1, while the CBL will be vested with the responsibility to implement
Component 2. To implement this, Memoranda of Agreement, which will be submitted to
the Fund for its non-objection before being finalized, will be entered into between the PIU
on the one hand and TASU/TASC and CBL on the other, respectively. Each Memorandum
will include definitions of disbursement triggers; flow of funds; and accounting, financial
reporting, and audit arrangements. Memoranda of Agreement will also be signed
between the TASU/TASC and its affiliated RCFIs.

6. The coordination, management and M&E of project activities will be under the
responsibility of the PIU responsible for IFAD-financed projects, reporting to the MOA, the
MFDP and the CBL. The mandate of the PIU shall comprise: Project accounting,
withdrawal applications, keeping of Project accounts, consolidating AWPBs, consolidating
annual reports, correspondence with government authorities on issues related to the
Financing Agreement (excluding the technical implementation matters), document
depository, procurement, submission of reports to IFAD and other related agencies,
monitoring and evaluation, preparation, guidance and supervision of the mid-term review
(MTR) mission, commissioning the beneficiary impact assessment, and preparing the
end-of-project evaluation. Other activities will include the preparation of and support to
supervision missions.

7. At the decentralized level, contacts will be established between the field officers of
TASU/TASC on the one hand and the County Agricultural Coordinators and District
Agriculture Officers, for planning, follow-up and monitoring of interventions related to the
agricultural sector. At each county where the Project would intervene, local authorities
and chiefs would be involved in the initial mobilization steps and activities to ensure
widespread participation and ownership of communities, to ensure that suitable locations
for buildings would be found and the land donated to the new RCFIs. Partnerships with
on-going projects will reinforce the complementary nature of the Project and leverage
impact on the target group. Under component 1 partnerships with Credit Unions, other
cooperatives and farmer organizations supported under existing projects will be
attempted where these are interested in financial services. This will include the Farmers
Union Network (FUN), which is supported by IFAD with Italian Government financing.

8. Project Start-up Phase. To facilitate a prompt start-up, the PIU shall commission
technical support for the required start-up activities immediately after the entry into
force of this Agreement. Resources have been allocated for part of this process. These
will include: (a) the recruitment of initial staff for TASU (manager, rural finance officer,
accountant, IT officer); (b) procurement of essential goods and services required during
the start-up phase; and (c) conduct of the first start-up workshop with partners (MOA,
CBL, MFDP, Afriland First Bank Liberia Limited (AFB), TASU).

9. Project Implementation Manual. The PIU shall prepare a draft Project
Implementation Manual (PIM) and shall forward it to the Fund for its non-objection. If the
Fund does not comment on the draft PIM within thirty (30) days after receipt, it shall be
deemed to have no objection. The PIM, or any provision thereof, may not be waived,
suspended, terminated, amended or modified without the prior agreement of the Fund.

Recommendation for approval

The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
financing to Republic of Turkey for the Göksu Taşeli Watershed Development
Project, as contained in paragraph 32.

Proposed loan and grant to the Republic of Turkey for
the Göksu Taşeli Watershed Development Project

I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development, and poverty context
1. Socioeconomic background. Turkey is an upper-middle-income country with a

population of 74.9 million and a GDP of US$822 billion in 2013 (according to the
World Bank). It is a European Union accession candidate and a member of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the G20.
Turkey is an increasingly important donor of bilateral official development
assistance and has a functioning market economy.

2. Poverty has declined in Turkey. In the last decade alone, the poverty rate was
halved, from 44 per cent in 2002 to 21 per cent in 2011; however, regional income
disparities remain. Imbalances persist in socioeconomic structures and income
levels across both rural and urban settlements, and across regions. Since 2000, the
regional development policy of Turkey has evolved to include enhancing the
competitiveness of regions, strengthening economic and social cohesion, and
reducing regional disparities. The Tenth Development Plan (2014-2018) aims at
directing public investments to areas that prioritize reducing regional development
disparities and utilizing their potential for regional development, particularly within
the Anatolia region.

3. Agriculture is no longer Turkey’s main driver of economic growth: in 2012, it
contributed only 9 per cent of the country’s GDP. Yet it is still important for rural
development, employment (particularly for women, who account for 44 per cent of
the labour force), export and manufacturing. In Turkey, farmers fall into two
categories: (i) commercialized farmers who use the latest technologies, have links
to a wide range of domestic and international information sources, are acutely
aware of global trends and consumer preferences, are interested in innovation and
are integrated into national and international markets; and (ii) resource-poor
farmers who practise subsistence or semi-subsistence farming, and are not
business-oriented. The major constraints facing smallholder agriculture are land
fragmentation, a lack of input technology, weak producers’ organizations and
limited access to markets.

B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and
results-based country strategic opportunities programme
(RB-COSOP)

4. Turkey’s transition to upper-middle-income country status has not ended poverty in
the country. In fact, even in relatively prosperous provinces, pockets of poverty
remain, particularly in the uplands. For years, the public and private sectors have
neither been interested nor able to address the constraints facing smallholder
agriculture in upland areas. The proposed project aims to support the Government’s
efforts to reduce degradation in the upland areas of the Göksu sub-catchment and
improve the natural resource base as a means of improving income and livelihoods
in upland villages. The project area has suffered from low investment in all sectors,



EB 2015/LOT/P.23/Rev.1

2

and continuing low standards of living have resulted in rural outmigration. IFAD’s
focus on poor and vulnerable farmers in less advantaged areas is therefore highly
relevant.

II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
5. The proposed project will be implemented in selected villages within 9 districts in

the Konya and Karaman provinces of central Anatolia. These districts are located in
the Göksu sub-catchment, one of the four sub-catchment areas in the east
Mediterranean watershed. There are 32,000 households living in the project area’s
202 villages, with a total population of 114,151 situated in the mountainous zones
of these 9 districts. The elevation in this area varies from 600 to 1,800 metres. The
majority of the population is engaged in producing fruit and field crops on
166,536 hectares. On average, these farmers each cultivate about 3.5 hectares of
fragmented cropland and keep goats (between 30 and 50 heads each). Cultivation
is either totally rainfed (the most prevalent) or mostly rainfed, with some irrigated
patches (about 15 per cent).

6. The target group. The project will target 32,000 households consisting of
productive smallholder farming households, poor households and nomadic
households. Productive smallholders include men and women who reside
permanently in the uplands and who practise mixed farming, with a marginal to
adequate surplus for marketing. Poor households consist of youth and women in
search of livelihood opportunities to avoid migration. This group will benefit from
direct targeting mechanisms guided by quotas for livelihood support to women in
participating in farmers’ organizations (FOs) and value chains. The poorest
households are nearly landless, not engaged in agricultural production and rely on
social assistance. The approximately 120 nomadic households in the project area
live on rangelands and engage in small ruminant production and small-scale milk
processing for household consumption and sale.

B. Project development objective
7. The overall goal of the project is to reduce rural poverty by supporting economic

diversification. The development objective is to increase farmers’ incomes through
improved agricultural production and marketing activities, and strengthen resilience
to climate shocks. The project will also improve the living standards of the nomadic
tribes in the Taurus Mountains by improving natural resource management.
Outcomes will include: (i) sustainably increased farm productivity; (ii) higher
product prices received by smallholder producers; and (iii) climate-resilient natural
resource management practices adopted.

C. Components/outcomes
8. The project has three components:

(a) Component 1. Agricultural productivity and natural resource
management will improve overall agricultural productivity and profitability by
sustainably managing land and water resources in upland areas through good
agricultural practices and climate-smart investments that reduce external
shocks.

Subcomponent 1.1. Improved agricultural productivity and quality will
focus on promising crops upstream in the value chains to bridge critical gaps
in order to improve the productivity and quality of cherries, grapes,
strawberries and medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs). Crop selection is
based on: (i) local production capacities; (ii) comparative advantages; (iii) the
seasonality of supply and demand; (iv) market access and productive
potential in different locations; and (v) indigenous knowledge and traditions.
Project support will include the introduction of: (i) new crop varieties;



EB 2015/LOT/P.23/Rev.1

3

(ii) modern growing techniques (e.g. production in plastic tunnels and a
high-wire training system for vineyards); (iii) water-saving irrigation
techniques supported by solar energy use (e.g. on-farm drip irrigation); and
(iv) agronomic practices that increase production and improve quality.
On-farm investments will be provided through the matching grant
programme.

Subcomponent 1.2. Natural resource management will promote best
practices and introduce adaptation measures for climate-resilient investments
in agricultural and grazing lands. The project will assist beneficiaries in
developing participatory grazing plans that integrate input from herders. It
will also support investments in overnight shelters to protect shepherds from
wild animals and inclement weather, scratch posts, salt licks and portable
mobile solar panels to provide energy in highland rangelands.

(b) Component 2. Market access enhancement will: increase farmers'
incomes through higher farm-gate prices; improve market knowledge and
linkages; reduce post-harvest losses; and enhance farmers’ ability to meet
market demand for quality, volume, regularity, homogeneity, packaging and
branding.

Subcomponent 2.1. Capacity-building for marketing will improve the
knowledge and skills of small farmers and FOs such as development
cooperatives and producers’ associations, and raise awareness of the
importance of post-harvest activities. Training will be provided on food
hygiene and safety, drying and sorting practices to reduce waste and improve
quality, and accounting and marketing. Producers' access to commercial
extension will be facilitated.

Subcomponent 2.2. Value chain development will finance downstream
investments by beneficiaries to support marketing of improved produce under
component 1 through the matching grant programme. Enterprises that add
value to farm produce and service providers in the value chains will be eligible
for project support. With the participation of the beneficiaries and their
associations, strategic investment plans (SIPs) will be prepared for each value
chain. These plans will serve as an investment framework that guides support
to beneficiaries at different stages in the value chain. The SIPs will be
developed in full collaboration with farmers, FOs and small and
microenterprises for cherries, grapes, strawberries and MAPs. SIPs will guide
investments – on- and off-farm – in the following: (i) post-harvest treatments
for hygiene and food safety of all value chain products; (ii) drying, grading,
sorting and packaging of dried grapes and MAPs; (iii) labelling and branding of
newly introduced value chain crops such strawberries and MAPs; and
(iv) re-cooling for cherries and cooling for strawberries.

(c) Component 3. Project management.

III. Project implementation
ApproachA.

9. The project will be implemented over seven years. As part of a programmatic
approach, the project will be the first of two phased over two overlapping cycles of
the performance-based allocation system cycles. The approach is also in line with
multi-year government plans and programmes. The value chain approach will be
adopted as a means of strengthening the long-neglected links between productive
poor farmers and markets (given the focus of both the public and the private sector
on more prosperous, resource-endowed and less ecologically challenging areas).
The project will use the SIP approach, which was introduced in the 2005
Sivas-Erzincan Development Project and has since been used in the Diyarbakir,
Batman and Siirt Development Project and the Ardahan-Kars-Artvin Development



EB 2015/LOT/P.23/Rev.1

4

Project. The proposed project will enhance the SIP approach by selecting pro-poor
value chains with strong potential to benefit from upstream and downstream
investments and become replicable and scalable models.

Organizational frameworkB.
10. The Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock will be the lead implementing

agency. The overall management responsibility will rest with this ministry’s General
Directorate of Agricultural Reform in Ankara, where a central project management
unit (CPMU) will be established. Two provincial project management units (PPMUs)
will be set up within the ministry’s provincial directorates in Konya and Karaman,
and will be responsible for day-to-day project management and implementation.

Planning, monitoring and evaluation, and learning andC.
knowledge management

11. The investments will be implemented on the basis of annual workplans and budgets
(AWPBs) prepared in consultation with beneficiaries, with inputs from SIPs for the
identified value chains. Each farmer support team will prepare an annual workplan
in collaboration with project beneficiaries in their villages. The PPMUs will review
implementation and develop consolidated provincial-level AWPBs. The consolidated
provincial AWPBs will be reviewed and incorporated into a project-level AWPB by
the CPMU. The AWPBs will be finalized according to procedures agreed upon with
IFAD and detailed in the project implementation manual. The AWPBs will be
submitted to the General Directorate of Agricultural Reform by the project manager
for review and approval by the steering committee, and presented to IFAD on a
no-objection basis.

12. Continuous learning and knowledge management will be integrated into the project
and mainstreamed into implementation at all levels. The project’s knowledge
management framework will inform the project learning agenda, including the
outputs, outcomes and impacts defined in the logical framework. The Ministry of
Food, Agriculture and Livestock already has a computerized management
information system in place for tracking the inputs, beneficiaries and productivity of
the Government’s agricultural support programme; this system will be linked with
the project’s monitoring and evaluation system. Thematic knowledge products
generated through the project – and knowledge management tools such
as capacity-building activities, communities of practice and South-South
Cooperation initiatives – will be developed and disseminated.

Financial management, procurement and governanceD.
13. Financial management. The CPMU will be responsible for financial management,

with support from the PPMUs in Konya and Karaman. The project will adopt
accounting procedures and policies consistent with international accounting
standards and with IFAD and government requirements. The Government of
Turkey’s Public Expenditures System, developed by the Ministry of Finance, will be
used to execute all payments from government counterpart contributions and IFAD
loan and grant.

14. Disbursement arrangements and flow of funds. Separate designated accounts
denominated in euro will be opened at the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey
for the IFAD loan and grant with an authorized allocation of approximately
12 months of project expenditure. The designated accounts will be replenished
using the imprest modality. Withdrawal applications will be prepared by the CPMU
every three months or when 30 per cent of the advance has been depleted –
whichever occurs first. Details of the disbursement arrangements, including the
amounts advanced to the designated accounts, will be specified in the project
implementation manual and stated in the letter to the borrower/recipient.

15. Audit. Annual project financial statements will be audited by the Treasury
Controller, who currently carries out external audits for all externally financed



EB 2015/LOT/P.23/Rev.1

5

projects in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and under terms of
reference cleared by IFAD.

16. Governance and financial management risks. A financial management risk
assessment of the proposed project and its fiduciary arrangements has concluded
that the project’s financial management arrangements and internal control systems
satisfy IFAD’s minimum requirements to: (i) provide accurate and timely
information on the progress of project implementation; and (ii) guarantee the
separation of functions through multiple independent controls. The assessment
rated the residual control risk after the implementation of appropriate risk
mitigation measures as low. Fiduciary risk might arise from an initial lack of
financial management capacity within the CPMU and the geographical spread of
project activities. Mitigation measures include strengthening the internal audit
function to include reviews of the use of funds at the village level, recruitment of an
experienced senior accountant in the CPMU and finalization of the project
implementation manual. The latter two are conditions for disbursement of project
funds.

17. Grace period. As per the Government’s request, the grace period is five years
instead of the standard three-year grace period for loans on ordinary terms.

SupervisionE.
18. The project will be supervised directly by IFAD. Supervision and implementation

support will be based on IFAD’s operational modalities and practices, including
those for loan and grant administration, and project implementation support.

IV. Project costs, financing and benefits
A. Project costs
19. The project cost is estimated at US$25 million, of which US$18.21 million

(or 72.8 per cent of the total) will be used to finance component 1: agricultural
productivity and natural resource management; US$4.74 million (or 18.9 per cent
of the total) will finance component 2: market access enhancement; and
US$2.05 million (or 8.2 per cent) will finance component 3: project management.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
21. The overall project analysis resulted in an economic internal rate of return of

17 per cent over 20 years. The project’s contribution to economic welfare is derived
from: the increased quantity and quality of market-oriented production; better
market access; and higher prices resulting from investments in branding and
employment along the value chains. The sensitivity analysis shows that the
economic internal rate of return remains robust at 10 per cent in the event of a
10 per cent reduction in benefits or a two-year delay in benefits.

D. Sustainability
22. The project is designed to ensure producers’ sustainable access to markets through

integration into existing and new value chains while maintaining the focus on good
agricultural practices and natural resource management. This includes enhancing
the quantity and quality of target crops, and providing assistance with modern
marketing (including branding) and market information. The introduction of farming
as a business for the producers will result in the optimization of land, water and
labour resources in the project area. Strengthening FOs through training and
capacity-building will enable longer-term and more stable contractual relationships
with collectors, processors and exporters. These impacts are expected to last
beyond the seven-year project period. Partnerships between producers’ groups and
the private sector will also be strengthened as a result of improved knowledge
management.

E. Risk identification and mitigation
23. At the macro level, the main risks relate to a reduced emphasis on poverty in

Turkey and macroeconomic instability. All of the Government’s development
priorities as outlined in the national and regional development plans and its
programmes are aimed at reducing income disparity over the long term. The
project area particularly suffers from such disparities; however as a politically
stable upper-middle-income country, the prospects for continuing economic growth
in the country are sound. Turkey continues to move towards European Union
accession and measures to meet standards for trade are being adopted along with
stringent environmental protection protocols. The project team has mitigated any
risk that the implementing agencies will lack capacity to provide market-oriented
information and build capacity by planning for the long-term contracting of a



EB 2015/LOT/P.23/Rev.1

7

marketing consultant. The consultant will be tasked with enhancing the
private-sector orientation of all stakeholders, including government staff at the
central and provincial levels.

V. Corporate considerations
Compliance with IFAD policiesA.

24. The project was designed in line with the IFAD Strategic Framework (2011-2015)
and IFAD’s policies on targeting, gender and environment, and natural resource
management. In addition, the 2012 Technical Note on Matching Grants and the
Private-Sector Strategy have been utilized to ensure that the project makes the
best use of all financial, technical and knowledge products available to IFAD.

Alignment and harmonizationB.
25. Turkey is a member of OECD and is chairing the G20 in 2015. The country is an

increasingly important donor of bilateral official development assistance. In a large
upper-middle-income country like Turkey, IFAD’s overall development contribution
could seem marginal, particularly considering the size of its considerable
development assistance as a donor. There has been demand for IFAD to
demonstrate new models, approaches, knowledge products and services, and global
reach to mobilize required expertise. New models and approaches used by previous
IFAD projects are being mainstreamed by the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and
Livestock, including SIPs, which were introduced by the Sivas-Erzincan
Development Project in 2005, and also used in the Diyarbakir, Batman and Siirt
Development Project and the Ardahan-Kars-Artvin Development Project. The
matching grant programme, originally developed by the World Bank for the Village
Based Participatory Investments Program in 2004 and mainstreamed by the
Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock in 2006, was enhanced by IFAD to make
it a pro-poor instrument. Through its knowledge management agenda, this project’s
CPMU will contribute to better harmonization of donor-funded and government
programmes for rural development.

Innovations and scaling upC.
26. IFAD’s recent focus on value chains is being integrated into the project as a means

to strengthen the links between poor farmers and markets (as a consequence of
both the public and private sectors’ focus on more prosperous, resource-endowed
farmers in less ecologically challenging areas). The project further develops the SIP
approach in rural Turkey with the selection of pro-poor value chains. Given the low
level of investment in the agricultural sector, the project will promote private-sector
investment through the matching grant programme, which facilitates public-private
partnerships though a service provider for marketing. It is expected that the
business models and innovations proven to be successful through this project will
be scaled up with government or other donor support.

27. Producers' climate adaptation capacity will be improved by training in agronomic
practices and awareness-raising on natural resource management geared to
maximize their incomes within the prevailing climate. Innovations such as
integrated pest management, vegetable production under cover, drip irrigation,
solar energy, efficient methods for water harvesting and training in natural resource
management will improve climate resilience.

Policy engagementD.
28. Turkey does not have a significant bilateral donor presence and IFAD’s relatively

limited investment does not entail strong policy engagement at the macro level.
IFAD’s investment has been strategically applied to engage in policy dialogue aimed
at influencing the Government's allocation of resources in impoverished areas.
Greater strategic focus is needed on the links between poverty reduction and the
sustainable management of fragile ecosystems. The establishment of IFAD’s



EB 2015/LOT/P.23/Rev.1

8

country office in Ankara will be an opportunity to enhance its role in aid
effectiveness.

VI. Legal instruments and authority
29. A project financing agreement between the Republic of Turkey and IFAD will

constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the
borrower/recipient. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as
appendix I.

30. The Republic of Turkey is empowered under its laws to receive financing from IFAD.

31. I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.

VII. Recommendation
32. I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of

the following resolution:

RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on ordinary terms to the

Schedule 1

Project Description and Implementation Arrangements

I. Project Description

1. Target Population. Project Beneficiaries shall be 32,098 households living in
202 villages with a total population of 114,151. The majority is engaged in fruit and field
crop production on 166,536 hectares (of which only 15% is irrigated), and in keeping small
flocks of small ruminants. In addition, the Project shall benefit around 120 nomadic
households living on rangelands in the Project Area.

2. Project Area. The Project shall be implemented in selected villages of 9 districts of
Konya and Karaman provinces of Central Anatolia. The Project Area includes 202 villages
that are situated in the mountainous parts of the 9 districts where the elevation varies
between 600 meters (m) and 1 800 m (the “Project Area”).

3. Goal. The overall Goal of the Project, as phase one of a two-Project Programme, is
to reduce rural poverty by supporting economic diversification through value chain
development and sustainable natural resource management.

4. Objective. The Project Development Objective is to increase farmers’ income from
improved agricultural production and marketing activities in the targeted area with
strengthened resilience to climate shocks. The Project shall also contribute to improving
the standards of living of the nomadic Yörük tribes in the highlands of the Taurus
Mountains, through capacity building that will assist them to organize for improved
management of the common natural resources and investments in animal and rangelands
development.

5. Components. The Project shall consist of three Components: (i) Agricultural
Productivity and Natural Resource Management, (ii) Market Access Enhancement, and
(iii) Project Management.

5.1 Component 1. Agricultural Productivity and Natural Resource Management: This
Component will improve overall agricultural productivity and profitability by
sustainable management of available and often scarce land and water resources in
upland areas through good agricultural practices and climate smart investments that
reduce external shocks. There shall be two sub-components: (i) Improved
Agricultural Productivity and Quality, and (ii) Natural Resource Management.
Improved Agricultural Productivity and Quality will focus on upstream of the value
chains (VCs) of promising crops in the Project Area and target gaps critical to
improve productivity and quality. Natural Resource Management will promote best
practices and introduce adaptation measures for climate resilient investments on
agricultural and grazing lands. Under this Component, the counterpart financing will
cover expenditure related to investment in Vegetable Production, Efficient Irrigation
Practices,  Access Roads to Pastures and Terracing on Agriculture Land.

5.2 Component 2. Market Access Enhancement: This Component will increase the
incomes of the farmers through higher farm gate prices, and improved market
knowledge and linkages. The Project will support farmers to reduce post-harvest
losses and add value to accommodate market demands for quality, volume,
regularity, homogeneity, range of varieties and packaging and branding. The
Component will build on the untapped entrepreneurial capacity of the semi-
commercial smallholders and will have two sub components: (i) Capacity Building for
Marketing, and (ii) Value Chains Development. Capacity Building for Marketing will
improve the knowledge and skills of small farmers and organizations (FOs) where



Appendix I EB 2015/LOT/P.23/Rev.1

5

they are members (e.g. development cooperatives, producers’ associations). Such
improvement is imperative for these producers to ensure remaining competitive and
accelerate the shift from “semi-subsistence farming” to “farming as a business”. This
will be accomplished through extensive training and capacity building for producers
and/or the FOs in order for them to make production and marketing decisions that
are guided by the value chains of crops that they produce. Value Chains
Development will finance, through the Matching Grants Programme (MGP),
downstream investments by the beneficiaries in support of the marketing of the
improved production and quality under Component 1. Service providers and
enterprises that add value to the farm gate or those that provide services to existing
and new VCs will be eligible to benefit.

Under components 2 and 3, the counterpart financing will cover expenditures related to
developing Strategic Investment Plans and seconded government staff respectively.

II. Implementation Arrangements

1. Project Duration. The Project shall be implemented over seven years. The first year
(2016) of implementation will predominantly be dedicated to initial studies, surveys, gap
analyses, and demand assessments. Activities in the first year will nevertheless not
exclude investment activities as long as they are supported with viable business plans. In
the first year, priority will be given to the capacity building, awareness raising,
sensitization and comprehensive training of all stakeholders on the approaches and
opportunities in the Project.  These activities will cover all producers, farmers
organizations, Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs), women, the Yörük, and
Project staff at all levels ranging from the Provincial Directorates of MFAL (PDA) and
District Directorates of Food Agriculture and Livestock (DDAs) to MFAL in Ankara.

2. Implementation. The Lead Project Agency shall be the MFAL located in Ankara. The
overall management responsibility will rest with the General Directorate of Agrarian
Reform (GDAR of MFAL) in Ankara where a Central Project Management Unit (CPMU) will
be established. The responsibility for field implementation will lie with the Provincial
Directorates of Konya and Karaman for the respective implementations in these
provinces. To be able to take advantage of experiences gained from various
internationally funded projects when it is needed by GDAR technical assistance can be
procured from related international agencies which have experience in providing similar
technical assistance in project management and coordination.

3. Provincial Project Management Units. Two Provincial Project Management Units
(PPMUs) will be embedded in the PDA in Konya and Karaman and will be charged with
the day-to-day field management and implementation of the Project. All staff of the
CPMU and the two PPMUs will be seconded from the cadres of MFAL. Eight
multi-disciplinary Farmer Support Teams (FSTs), each one comprising specialists for field
crop production, horticultural production and agricultural economics, where one will be
female and will be assigned by the PDA to the PPMUs to carry out extension services and
maintain frequent contact with the beneficiaries. Each team will be responsible for one or
more districts identified based on their number of villages and the proximity of those to
each other and the district centers.

4. Project Parties. Several government agencies are active in the Project Area. Close
collaboration and coordination will be sought with the following that are directly related
to the objectives of the Project and will complement its rural poverty reduction and
marketing enhancement initiatives: (i) the Konya Regional Development Administration
(KOP); (ii) the Regional Directorate of Forestry of the Ministry of Forestry and Water
Affairs (MFWA); (iii) the Greater Metropolitan Municipality of Konya; (iv) the Governors’
Offices of Konya and Karaman as Turkish Employment Agency (İŞKUR) and Ministry of



Appendix I EB 2015/LOT/P.23/Rev.1

Recommendation for approval

The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation on the proposed
financing to the Republic of El Salvador for the National Programme of Rural Economic
Transformation for Living Well - Rural Adelante, as contained in paragraph 46.

Proposed loan and grant to the Republic of El Salvador
for the National Programme of Rural Economic
Transformation for Living Well - Rural Adelante

I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1. El Salvador has the highest population density in Latin America, with an area of

just 20,742 km² and a population of 6,279,783 (2014). Demographic growth was
0.5 per cent per annum during the period 2001-2013, the lowest rate in Central
America and one of the lowest in Latin America as a whole, owing to negative
migratory flows and a low gross birth rate.

2. El Salvador is a middle-income country. The economy has transitioned from an
agrarian model to a model based on services, consumption, and nontraditional
agricultural and industrial exports. Real GDP grew 1.9 per cent per annum and GNI
per capita 1.19 per cent per annum during the period 2001-2013. Inflation in 2013
stood at 0.76 per cent compared to a high of 7.26 per cent in 2008. Low growth
results in part from low levels of investment – leading in turn to insufficient
employment that is poor in quality and limited income growth for the population.
The low level of economic growth is directly related to poor productivity both
overall and by sector, in addition to insecurity and crime.

3. Poverty in El Salvador is associated with both historic internal issues – the civil
war, the economic and market model and natural disasters such as the earthquake
in 2011 – and, more recently, a series of external shocks such as falling coffee
prices, the global recession and higher oil prices, all of which have contributed to
low economic growth and slow progress on social indicators. Poverty affects in
particular vulnerable and traditionally excluded population groups such as
indigenous peoples, children, young people, women and seniors. Among rural
young people between the ages of 18 and 35, 38 per cent live in poverty and are
seriously impacted by crime and violence. Among rural women, many of whom are
subject to unemployment and family violence, 42 per cent are poor. Although there
are no exact figures on the number of indigenous people in El Salvador, Ministry of
Health estimates indicate that in the Eastern region alone there are 32,725
indigenous people (2014), the vast majority of whom are living in poverty. This
population group has historically been marginalized, until 2014 when the
Legislative Assembly issued official recognition.

4. During the period 2000-2013 poverty declined in the country. The percentage of
households living in poverty fell from 38.8 per cent to 29.6 per cent with the
reduction in rural poverty of 18 per cent. Urban poverty also posted a slight decline
from 29.9 per cent to 26.2 per cent.

5. Despite the reduction in poverty overall and the decline in rural poverty, growth in
the agriculture sector has stagnated, as a result of the crisis in the traditional
export agriculture model, low levels of domestic and foreign private investment and
increasing environmental vulnerability. High price volatility within the agriculture
sector, for both inputs and products, has increased uncertainty and reduced
incentives to invest in agriculture. The sector's contribution to GDP fell slightly



EB 2015/LOT/P.34

2

during the period 2001-2013, from 10.12 per cent of GDP in 2001 to 10 per cent in
2013.

6. Climate change and increasing climate volatility pose one of the greatest
challenges to agriculture given the magnitude and frequency of extreme events,
which have caused significant losses and economic damage in recent decades. El
Salvador is one of the most climate change-vulnerable countries in the world. The
country's exposure to intense rainfall in the North-east and recurring drought in the
Eastern region, within the dry corridor, results in losses – particularly for
smallholder farmers.

7. The Government of El Salvador launched the Five-year Development Plan 2014-
2019 to spur economic and social growth. This document sets out a roadmap to
achieve equitable and inclusive development that will translate into living well for
the population. The plan highlights three priorities: productive employment, under
a model of sustained economic growth; education with inclusion and social equity;
and effective citizen safety. The plan also recognizes that environmental policy and
risk mitigation are a social and economic imperative. These priorities are geared to
achieve, within five years, a human development index of 0.7, associated with
countries at a higher level of human development.

B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and RB-
COSOP

8. National and sector policy priorities call for a number of actions to generate
opportunities for living well for the population as a whole, while recognizing the
different needs of various population groups. IFAD's priorities and interests in the
country are aligned with government policies: areas of complementarity include
economic development; developing human potential; inclusion and equity,
especially for young people, women and indigenous people; sustainable production
with adaptation to climate change; government consultation with society by
promoting dialogue and citizen participation; and promoting results-based
management.

9. In addition, the programme is fully consistent with IFAD's strategic objectives as
outlined in the new results-based country strategic opportunities programme (RB-
COSOP) for El Salvador, which are as follows: (i) improve family farmers’ access to
resources, technologies and information to enable them to develop more
sustainable agriculture and adapt better to climate change; (ii) promote economic
empowerment of youth, rural women and indigenous peoples; and (iii) contribute
to the Government’s efforts to make public spending and investments in rural
areas more efficient, effective and equitable.

II. Programme description
A. Programme area and target group
10. During the first stage, the programme area will include the four departments

comprising El Salvador's Eastern region – La Unión, Usulután, San Miguel and
Morazán – and the 87 municipalities that lie within them. In view of their condition
of poverty and climate change vulnerability, first priority will be given to the
municipalities located in the region's north and central areas, followed by those
located in the south, in accordance with national and sector priorities. The eastern
region forms part of the dry corridor and is subject to cyclical drought, which is one
of the main causes of social, environmental, productive and economic crisis and
catastrophe.

11. The target group includes rural people living in poverty in the eastern region who
have productive and associative potential. The programme will pursue three
strategies to reach the target population: (i) a value chains-based strategy; (ii) a
targeting strategy based on selection by participating organizations; and (iii) a
social targeting strategy based on selection of families and people in the most
excluded groups: women, youth and indigenous people.



EB 2015/LOT/P.34

12. Through their participation in organizations, and on an individual basis in the case
of young people and adults participating in the technical training programme, a
total of 8,300 families will benefit directly and an estimated 32,000 people will
benefit directly and indirectly. Direct beneficiaries will be mainly women or men
heads of household, young people and women, acting as representatives for
purposes of the programme. Indirect beneficiaries will be members of the direct
representatives' families, estimated at four people per family.

13. Women account for 40 per cent of all direct beneficiaries of Rural Adelante, young
people 20 per cent and indigenous people 5 per cent. In the case of young people,
equal numbers of men and women are included to continue encouraging egalitarian
participation by both groups and the creation of a more equitable new generation
ready to take over.

B. Programme development objective
14. The development objective of Rural Adelante is to sustainably increase the incomes

of poor rural families in the departments of San Miguel, Usulután, La Unión and
Morazán and facilitate their adaptation to climate change. The programme will have
achieved its objective when at least 8,300 families (33,200 beneficiaries) have
received services under the project, 5,900 families with business plans have
improved their incomes1 and 5,000 producers (20,000 beneficiaries) have been
provided with more climate change-resilient organizational business plans.

C. Components/outcomes
15. The programme is structured in four interrelated components:

(a) Capacity-building for sustainable production adapted to climate
change. The objective of this component is to improve research, extension,
education and training services to develop priority value chains under a
climate change adaptation approach. The component seeks to generate
knowledge by: (i) setting up a climate information service; (ii) conducting
technology research and innovation; (iii) developing climate change
adaptation plans; and (iv) strengthening human talent. The latter includes
two actions: (i) developing training for producers linked to value chains; and
(ii) designing and implementing a technical training programme for young
people and adults.

(b) Competitive, sustainable and inclusive value chain development. The
objective of this component is to promote sustainable market access by
target groups – smallholder farmers, women, youth and indigenous people –
as a way of raising the incomes of poor rural families. To this end, a
competitive, inclusive and sustainable value chains approach will be
promoted, based on market demand. The expected outcome is for
organizations to make the necessary improvements to sell high quality
products demanded by the market. The programme will encourage value
chain actors – input suppliers, technical assistance and training providers,
financial service providers, private and public collection and
commercialization centres and marketers – to achieve more efficient
coordination and enter into strategic partnerships to strengthen links and
support services.

(c) Strengthening the public policy framework for rural development. The
objective of this component is to strengthen the institutional and policy
framework for rural development. This will be based on policy analysis,
formulation and implementation in connection with selected value chains –
with policies on gender, rural youth and indigenous peoples, the environment
and climate change adaptation. To this end, support will be provided for the
functional capacities of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG), the
National Youth Institute (INJUVE), municipalities, and associations of

1 Measured by gross income increased by 100 per cent for one or more years, taking into account diversified income sources associated
with the programme.



EB 2015/LOT/P.34

4

producers, rural youth, women and indigenous peoples. The expected
outcome is strengthened capacities of women, rural youth and indigenous
peoples, to improve their participation in the rural development public policy
cycle.

(d) Programme management and M&E. This component covers programme
management and administration, and includes M&E.

III. Programme implementation
A. Approach
16. The programme approach is based on three pillars promoting sustainable action:

competitiveness, inclusion and sustainability. These provide the frame of reference
or approach guiding the strategic and operational decisions to be taken to achieve
the objectives and expected outcomes, i.e. they provide the elements that
determine whether a programme action can be included in accordance with these
three pillars.

17. Competitiveness refers to increased capacity on the part of organizations, families
and people to participate in markets for goods and services around selected value
chains with the required quality, quantity and frequency. Inclusion, besides
covering differences in gender, culture and economic sector of provenance, seeks
to create and defend a level playing field – equal conditions and opportunities for
all in accessing resources, opportunities, and participatory and decision-making
platforms under the programme. Sustainability calls for directing all programme
actions to respect and guarantee environmental quality, in order to avoid
environmental degradation, conserve and protect natural resources, promote the
generation and use of climate change adapted technologies, and employ mitigation
measures to address natural disasters and risk management, resulting in a
population with greater resilience to environmental risks.

B. Organizational framework
18. Responsibility for programme implementation will reside with Ministry of

Agriculture and Livestock. Setting up the programme management unit (PMU),
which will have functional autonomy but report to the Ministry of Agriculture and
Livestock, will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock as
the implementing agency, through the Rural Development Directorate (DGDR). The
PMU will be headed up by programme management. Implementation will also
involve the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as the agency
administering resources and specialized service providers, which will include among
its activities a capacity-building strategy for the Ministry of Agriculture and
Livestock in procurement.

19. The PMU will have a structure comprising a general manager, five advisory units
(administrative and financial; communication; capacity-building; inclusion, gender
and planning; and M&E and knowledge management). In addition, there will be
three specialists in thematic areas performing a coordination role: environment and
climate change adaptation, rural business and public policy. The PMU will have, as
part of financial administration, an administrator, an accountant, a procurement
specialist, an accounting assistant, a financial assistant responsible for the
integrated financial administration system (SAFI) and a logistics officer.

20. To implement the programme and its components, the PMU will enter into the
necessary agreements with local, national, public and private entities. To this end,
selection and accreditation processes will take place for service providers based on
value chain needs and strategies, organizational business plans and other
initiatives.



EB 2015/LOT/P.34

C. Planning, monitoring and evaluation, and learning and
knowledge management

21. The programme will design and implement a planning and monitoring system to
serve as a management instrument to facilitate platforms for learning, exchange of
experiences, best practices and results dissemination, and generate updated
relevant information on programme performance, with an emphasis on results
measurement (outputs, outcomes and impact).

D. Financial management, procurement and governance
22. The DGDR of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, through the PMU

administrative and financial unit, will be responsible for the programme's financial
management – including the annual workplan, flow of funds, disbursements,
internal controls, accounting, financial reporting and audit. In addition, to improve
funds management, the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock will sign an
agreement with UNDP, which will support the programme in resource
administration and procurement. The programme will record accounting
transactions in SAFI.

23. Flow of funds. The borrower/recipient, through MAG, will open a designated
account exclusively for the loan proceeds and another designated account
exclusively for the ASAP grant proceeds at the Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador.

24. Procurement. Procurement of goods and contracting for works and consulting
services under the programme will be conducted in accordance with the guidelines
on the procurement of goods and contracting of works and services for IFAD
projects (IFAD guidelines).

25. UNDP will support the programme in procurement processes, and the agreement
between the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock and UNDP will cover capacity-
building activities to strengthen the procurement area within the Ministry of
Agriculture and Livestock.

26. Audit. The annual consolidated financial statements will be audited each year by
an independent auditor in accordance with IFAD guidelines on project audits. All
project accounts will be audited, including those designated for loan funds, grant
funds and national counterpart funds. The audit reports will be delivered to IFAD
six months after the end of each fiscal year.

D. Supervision
27. IFAD will provide direct supervision of the programme. Implementation support will

be provided from the outset of the programme to prepare properly for start-up.
IFAD and the borrower will perform a midterm review following year three.

IV. Programme costs, financing, benefits
A. Programme costs
28. The programme will have a total cost of approximately US$18.69 million, including

contingencies. Component 1 will involve an expense of US$3.64 million, equivalent
to 19 per cent, and component 2 will cost US$10.46 million, representing 56 per
cent of total investment. Component 3 will involve an expense of approximately
US$1.22 million, representing 7 per cent of the total. Finally, component 4 will cost
approximately US$3.37 million, or 18 per cent.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
30. The cost-benefit methodology was used for the economic analysis, based on a

calculation of the flow of net incremental annual benefits for the selected 10-year
period. The cost-benefit or profitability analysis was done using the internal rate of
return (IRR) and net present value (NPV). The IRR was calculated on the basis of
the economic flow of funds generated by Rural Adelante (economic IRR). Generally
a project is considered economically viable if the IRR exceeds the opportunity cost
of capital, 12 per cent in the case of this programme. In calculating the IRR,
economic benefits and costs for a 10-year period were taken into account.

31. The financial IRR for the programme overall is 20 per cent with an NPV of US$6.40
million, and US$22.20 million if the NPV is calculated for a 20-year period.

D. Sustainability
32. Since the Rural Adelante approach was put forward, plans have called for actions

and innovations to remain in place beyond the programme implementation period.
Specifically, sustainability is expected to be achieved once the target population is
able to replicate what is being proposed or implemented, and to go even further
upon achieving the capacity to continue developing innovations – i.e. the target
group has the potential to innovate by consciously making adjustments and
changes for their own benefit in the organizations and value chains in which they
participate. Equally, sustainability will have been achieved once the Ministry of



EB 2015/LOT/P.34

7

Agriculture and Livestock is replicating, improving upon and making adjustments to
innovations.

E. Risk identification and mitigation
33. The programme implementation risks identified have a low to medium probability

of occurring and little potential impact on achieving the objectives and expected
outcomes.

34. Among the main risks are: (i) natural and climate phenomena having a severe
impact on the eastern region; and (ii) an escalation of crime and violence in the
programme area.

35. Measures to mitigate these risks could include: (i) undertaking concrete risk
management actions to address natural and climate phenomena by Rural Adelante
and other IFAD projects operating in the region; and (ii) maintaining contingency
plans and clear safety regulations for programme staff and an ongoing dialogue
with the relevant authorities in the programme area.

V. Corporate considerations
A. Compliance with IFAD policies
36. The programme proposal falls within the overarching goal of IFAD's Strategic

Framework 2011-2015 and contributes to achieving the strategic objectives to
improve access to services that contribute to poverty reduction and to promote
economic and natural assets that strengthen the resilience of disadvantaged rural
populations. In addition, the programme approach and implementation strategies
are aligned with IFAD's policies and strategies on policy dialogue, targeting rural
poor people, gender equality and women's empowerment, engagement with
indigenous peoples (including matters relating to free, prior and informed consent),
natural resource management and the environment, climate change, social,
environmental and climate evaluation procedures, rural finance and business
management risk, and knowledge management and innovation.

B. Harmonization and alignment
37. IFAD's priorities and interests in the country are aligned with the policies of the

Government of El Salvador. Areas of complementarity include economic
development; developing human potential; inclusion and equity, especially for
youth, women and indigenous people; sustainable production adapted to climate
change; government consultation with society by promoting dialogue and citizen
participation; and promoting results-based management.

38. Within the sector, IFAD is consistent with the priorities of promoting food
sovereignty and security; production development through value chains;
environmental sustainability and adaptation to climate change; developing family
farming; reactivating cooperatives and modernizing institutions.

39. In addition, the programme will directly address the strategic objectives of the RB-
COSOP 2015-2019.

C. Innovation and scaling up
40. For the Government of El Salvador and IFAD, this new operation offers an

opportunity to capitalize on the experiences of recent years around rural
development and rural poverty reduction in the eastern region. These experiences
include the Rural Development Project for the North-Eastern Region (PRODERNOR)
and the Rural Development and Modernization Project for the Eastern Region
(PRODEMORO) and, more recently, the Rural Territorial Competitiveness
Programme (Amanecer Rural) – in addition to participation in regional programmes
on, inter alia, gender, policy dialogue and remittances. IFAD's loans and grants
operations have generated significant human and social capital that is fundamental
to the qualitative leap the country intends to take in reactivating productive and
entrepreneurial capacity in rural areas by strengthening profitable economic
initiatives.



EB 2015/LOT/P.34

41. A new intervention in the eastern region is based on transforming the traditional
economic, social and environmental model, whereby the intention is to bring about
change with the following innovative elements: (i) targeting territory, organizations
and people coordinated under a single platform with a value chain orientation,
rather than on the isolated initiatives traditionally undertaken; (ii) competitiveness
and market demand driving value chains to generate income and permanent
quality employment and improve wellbeing; (iii) promoting collective participation
around a single chain in which various groups and actors come together as a
function of the market and strengthening business and financing criteria, such as
sustainability considerations; (iv) IFAD financing acting as a catalyst, distributed in
different proportions according to the expenditure category in the business plan
and the type of organization; (v) linking the target population with financial
services to reduce their dependence on nonreimbursable transfers, inculcating a
sustainable business rather than a welfare-based culture; (vi) developing value
chain businesses under an approach that protects natural resources, the
environment and adaptation to climate change; (vii) promoting inclusion and
equity in participation by young people, women and indigenous people as actors
that require support for their development.

D. Policy engagement
42. The programme will demonstrate experience with integrating public policy dialogue

around value chains at the regional level with other platforms for dialogue already
existing in the country, and with support for implementing public policies in support
of climate change adaptation and mainstreaming rural women, youth and
indigenous people.

VI. Legal instruments and authority
43. A financing agreement between the Republic of El Salvador and IFAD will constitute

the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the borrower/
beneficiary. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as an
appendix.

44. The Republic of El Salvador is empowered under its laws to receive financing from
IFAD and the Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP) Trust
Fund, through IFAD in its capacity as Trustee of the ASAP Trust Fund.

45. I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Lending Policies and Criteria for IFAD.

VII. Recommendation
46. I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of

the following resolutions:

RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on ordinary terms to the
Republic of El Salvador in an amount equivalent to ten million eight hundred
fifty thousand euros (EUR 10,850,000) and upon such terms and conditions
as shall be substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions
presented herein.

RESOLVED FURTHER: that, under the Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture
Programme (ASAP), the Fund shall provide a grant to the Republic of El
Salvador in an amount equivalent to three million five hundred sixty thousand
special drawing rights (SDR 3,560,000) and upon such terms and conditions
as shall be substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions
presented herein.

Anexo 1

Descripción del Programa y disposiciones de ejecución

I. Descripción del Programa

1. Población-objetivo. La población-objetivo del Programa incluye a la población rural
en condición de pobreza de la región Oriental, con potencial productivo y asociativo. El
Programa utilizará tres estrategias para alcanzar su población objetivo: i) una estrategia
basada en cadenas de valor, ii) una estrategia de focalización basada en la selección de
las organizaciones participantes y iii) una estrategia de focalización social basada en la
selección de familias y personas de los grupos más excluidos: mujeres, jóvenes e
indígenas.

2. Meta y área el Programa. La meta del programa es “contribuir a reducir la pobreza
rural en la Región Oriental de El Salvador”, que comprende los Departamentos de San
Miguel, Usulután, La Unión y Morazán. El área del Programa podrá modificarse de común
acuerdo entre las Partes siempre que se tenga en cuenta los criterios de selección
iniciales.

3. Objetivos. El objetivo de desarrollo del Programa es “incrementar de forma
sostenible los ingresos de familias rurales en condición de pobreza en los Departamentos
de San Miguel, Usulután, La Unión y Morazán y facilitar su adaptación al cambio
climático”.

4. Componentes. El Programa consta de tres (3) componentes:

Componente 1. Fortalecimiento de capacidades para la producción sustentable con

Recommendation for approval

The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
grant to the Republic of Burundi for the Value Chain Development Programme –
Phase II (PRODEFI-II), as contained in paragraph 64.

Proposed grant to the Republic of Burundi for the Value
Chain Development Programme – Phase II (PRODEFI II)

I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1. Rural development and poverty. Burundi is among the world’s poorest countries,

ranking 178th of 187 according to the Human Development Index. In 2013, despite a
growth rate of 4.5 per cent, GDP per capita (US$298) was lower than in 1990
(US$497). The incidence of poverty remains high, with 67 per cent of the population
living below the poverty line.

2. More than 90 per cent of people living in Burundi derive their livelihoods from
agriculture. Family farming, which provides 95 per cent of the food supply, does not
meet nutritional needs, and the rate of self-sufficiency in food production1 is
estimated at just over 42 per cent. Malnutrition affects 70 per cent of children in
poor households, mainly in rural areas.

3. Most rural poor people are smallholders – mainly women and orphan heads of
household – cultivating plots of less than one hectare and subsisting on the food
crops they grow. Their poverty is attributable mainly to low productivity as a result
of: (i) extremely small landholdings, hence the need to intensify production; (ii) poor
soil fertility in the absence of livestock and manure, and soil degradation from
erosion; (iii) a lack of equipment and technical and financial capital; (iv) a lack of
inputs such as seed and fertilizer owing to limited purchasing power; (v) a lack of
technical knowledge; (vi) prolonged dry periods in recent years and reduced periods
of rainfall; (vii) the lack of water management systems; (viii) poor processing and
marketing capacity countrywide; (ix) emerging farmers organizations that have not
yet developed profitable activities to ensure sustainability; and (x) poorly managed
markets.

4. Policy, governance and institutions, political and economic issues. Burundi’s
economy is characterized by structural weaknesses, in particular isolation, poor
diversification, uncompetitive agricultural products and high demographic growth.

5. The Government undertook, in its Vision 2025, to lower the rate of demographic
growth to 2 per cent and, in the National Agricultural Investment Plan (PNIA), to
boost growth in the agriculture sector to 6 per cent per annum. In 2013, the country
joined the Scaling Up Nutrition movement and the Multi-sector Food and Nutritional
Security Platform in order to achieve the first Millennium Development Goal.

6. The electoral process now under way risks slowing expected progress as a result of
putting in place policies and regulatory frameworks, both at the macro-economic
level and in implementing programmes and projects.

1 Source: PNIA, "The food deficit for the year 2010 is evaluated at 471,884 tonnes of grain equivalents (GEs), out of total
estimated needs of 817,000 tonnes of GEs nationally, representing an unmet basic needs rate of close to 58 per cent".



EB 2015/115/R.6

2

B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities
7. PRODEFI is the cornerstone of the country programme in that it encompasses

common implementation functions at the central and regional level, such as
procurement and financial management.

8. Needed action includes: (i) completing activities2 under PRODEFI and replicating
them on a larger scale to achieve sufficient production volume (milk and rice), to
facilitate structuring the value chains; and (ii) better supporting actors throughout
the value chain by linking activities under the rural youth employment component
with core programme activities.

9. In view of the agriculture sector’s vulnerability to climate change, IFAD proposes to
provide a complementary grant under the Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture
Programme (ASAP).

10. Nutritional considerations will be introduced into PRODEFI-II to raise awareness
around adopting best practices in diet and hygiene.

II. Programme description
A. Programme area and target group
11. The PRODEFI-II programme area will be identical to that of the first phase, i.e. the

provinces of Bubanza, Cibitoke, Gitega, Karusi, Kayanza, Muramvya and Ngozi, as
well as the province of Muyinga. The programme interventions will be implemented
in communes adjacent to those covered by the Agricultural Intensification and Value-
enhancing Support Project (PAIVA-B).

12. This decision is fully aligned with the strategy adopted by IFAD on geographical
concentration around managed wetlands to enhance the visibility and scale of
impact.

13. Targeting will be simultaneously by activity, by province and by commune. The
priority target group of PRODEFI-II will be smallholders, crop and livestock farmers,
women and rural young people promoting economic initiatives upstream, within and
downstream of the rice and milk value chains and other secondary value chains such
as bean, maize, plantain and banana.

B. Programme development objectives
14. Overall objective. The overall objective of PRODEFI-II will be to promote increases

in incomes and improvements in food security for poor households in the programme
area.

15. Development objective. The specific PRODEFI-II objectives are as follows:
increase physical productive capital by building the resilience of production systems
to climate change; intensify crop and livestock farming to improve nutritional status
and, ultimately, structure the milk and rice value chains, inter alia, to promote youth
employment and strengthen capacity of the actors.

C. Components/outcomes
16. The programme is structured around three main components:

Component 1: Sustainable growth in productive capital and institutional
capacity-building for value chain actors

17. The activities implemented under subcomponent 1.1 – Hydro-agricultural
improvements and infrastructure – will be as follows: (i) development of 2,330 ha of
new wetlands on nine sites; (ii) rehabilitation of 147 km of tracks over nine sections
of access roads to open up access to the new wetland sites identified and one stretch
of track for a developed wetland straddling the provinces of Karusi and Ngozi; (iii)
development of 23,300 ha of watersheds around the new wetland sites identified and

2 This will also provide an opportunity to complete PAIVA-B activities in shared intervention areas.



EB 2015/115/R.6

3

implementation of the second phase of watershed development in 17 wetlands,
undertaken under IFAD projects (10 PRODEFI sites and seven PAIVA-B sites), of
which close to 10 per cent are financed under ASAP; and (iv) capacity-building for
four communal land registration offices to accelerate the issuance of 5,000 titles.

18. Subcomponent 1.2 – Adaptation to climate change – will be divided into three
sections: (i) integrated protection of investments against climate risk at the
watershed level, over 1,000 ha (Ruvubu watershed); (ii) adaptation of rural
engineering designs to climate variability by setting national technical standards;
and (iii) building the resilience of erosion control structures and crops to climate
change by intensifying forage and legume crops.

19. Activities under subcomponent 1.3 – Agricultural intensification – will be as follows:
(i) input supply (e.g. quality seed, fertilizer and manure, phytosanitary products);
(ii) strengthening the community livestock solidarity chain (3,000 cattle) by
promoting small livestock among young people; and (iii) building the capacities of
crop and livestock farmers with farmers field schools (FFS) (39, 112 and 100 FFS for
rice, food crops and livestock, respectively). A climate early warning system will be
developed using ASAP financing.

20. Activities under subcomponent 1.4 – Inclusive community organization and
institutional linkages – will be as follows: (i) capacity-building for Burundi public and
private institutions such as the community development committees (CDC) and
communal community development committees (CCDC); (ii) development of a
gender equality strategy for IFAD-funded projects in Burundi; and (iii) awareness-
raising around fundamental women’s rights, adult functional literacy, support for
organizing and financing solidarity groups, legal and psycho-social support for
victims and post-traumatic reconstruction, and reduction of women’s workload.

21. Subcomponent 1.5 – Combating chronic malnutrition – will include the following
activities: (i) training 2,000 people in the home nutritional learning (FAN) method for
preventing chronic malnutrition; (ii) setting up 350 FAN; (iii) awareness-raising for
community leaders, including 200 rural development actors; and (iv) implementation
of 350 microprojects in livestock (pigs, chickens, rabbits, goats) and market
gardening (kitchen gardens).

Component 2: Value-addition and strengthening of value chains

22. Support provided under subcomponent 2.1 – Organizational framework and value
chain financing – will cover the following activities: (i) development of financial
instruments adapted to the programme area to finance production cycles and
storage and processing cycles; and (ii) professionalization of dairy cooperatives, rice
growers cooperatives and the three cooperatives operating in the maize value chain,
to enable them to provide services to their members.

23. Subcomponent 2.2 – Support for priority value chains – will have two sections.

24. Dairy value chain. Support will be provided to: (i) complete the installation of
facilities to secure milk (refrigerated tanks and milk collection centres in areas where
dairy livestock is already kept; (ii) promote the installation of sales points with a
target of one or two per milk collection centre; (iii) install two mini-dairies in areas
with high dairy potential (Gitega and Ngozi); and (iv) establish partnerships with
private actors.

25. Rice value chain. Support will be provided to: (i) install drying infrastructure
(7,800 m² of new drying areas) and storage infrastructure (2,600 m² of new
warehouses); (ii) set up two improved husking units and two mini-rice mills for
quality rice marketing; and (iii) strengthen the consultative platform for value chain
actors.

26. Secondary value chains. Support will be provided to: (i) lift constraints on
segments of the major value chains (bean, maize, banana) in the event of



EB 2015/115/R.6

4

bottlenecks, such as the lack of healthy varieties of banana, the lack of bean
varieties tolerant of higher temperatures; and (ii) install storage infrastructure and
processing equipment.

27. Under component 2.3 – Improving sustainable and decent employment for rural
young people – the following activities will take place: (i) put in place an enabling
institutional environment for youth employment; (ii) strengthen specialized
proximity structures (research, innovation and training centres) to enable them to
provide employment-related services to young people; and (iii) create jobs for 150
young entrepreneurs, and income-generating activities for 1,500 rural young people.

Component 3: Organizational support, knowledge management and
facilitation.

28. This component calls for good coordination and sound and transparent management
of the programme.

29. Subcomponent 3.1 calls for: (i) providing the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock,
specifically the provincial departments of agriculture and livestock (DPAE), including
at the communal level, with monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and planning
assistance to contribute to participatory planning of programme activities,
monitoring of implementation and dissemination of results; and (ii) capacity-building
for regional coordination units.

30. Under subcomponent 3.2: (i) overall coordination and administrative, financial and
procurement functions will be centralized in Bujumbura; (ii) technical functions will
be decentralized to facilitate the implementation and close monitoring of activities by
regional coordination units; and (iii) the PRODEFI programme facilitation and
coordination unit (PFCU) will manage the programme at the national level and two
regional facilitation and coordination units will manage it at the regional levels, one
in the centre covering Gitega, Karusi and Muramvya and one in the north covering
Kayanza and Ngozi.

III. Programme execution
A. Approach
31. The intervention will be based on the following approach: (i) expansion of activities

in the PRODEFI area such that the technical package is implemented in its entirety;
(ii) development of new wetland sites; (iii) gradual implementation of nutritional
activities in areas where dairy, rice, legume and food production has increased under
PRODEFI; (iv) implementation of rural employment activities in areas where
PRODEFI has successfully set up milk collection centres and dehusking units; and (v)
implementation of activities to intensify and develop forage crops under an ASAP
grant in areas where PRODEFI was first active. The aim is to consolidate PRODEFI
activities and gradually expand the intervention area to the new wetlands identified.

B. Organizational framework
32. Programme oversight and steering. The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock will

continue to oversee PRODEFI-II. The strategic steering committee, which will provide
general steering and coordination, and the technical steering committee, which will
report to the Government on programme implementation and general
administration, will continue to be the supervisory bodies, one at the strategic level
and the other at a more technical level.

33. Organization and management. The regional coordination units will be set up by
redeploying the PRODEFI branch office heads, including two regional coordinators,
and the other branch office heads will be assigned to M&E or regional components.
Part of the PRODEFI technical staff will also be redeployed to regional coordination
units and additional staff will be recruited in the regions as needed.



EB 2015/115/R.6

C. Planning, monitoring and evaluation, and learning and
knowledge management

34. Monitoring and evaluation. The M&E manual used during the first phase of
PRODEFI will be updated to include a limited number of files. In addition, steps will
be taken to address the constraints encountered in the last phase, such as the lack
of centralized data, poor data analysis and insufficient capacity for information
systems management. The overall organization of M&E arrangements will be based
on the information provided by DPAE and communal technicians providing
government functions at the local level.

35. Learning, capitalization and knowledge management. The knowledge
generated by the M&E system, beneficiaries and exchanges of experience between
IFAD projects and those funded by other technical and financial partners will be
capitalized on. PRODEFI-II will draw on lessons learned during implementation of the
first phase of PRODEFI and of PAIVA-B, particularly in terms of organizing value
chains.

D. Financial management, procurement and governance
36. Capacity-building will be provided for the PRODEFI financial management team to

ensure better use of the TOM2PRO software (multi-site model) on all financial
matters: accounting, commitments, financial statements, budgetary monitoring, etc.
The PFCU will be responsible and accountable to the Government and to IFAD for
using the programme resources in compliance with the financing agreement signed
with IFAD. The accounting system will be consistent with internationally accepted
accounting principles and standards set by the Government of Burundi. The PFCU
will draw up quarterly statements of the accounting and financial situation and
transmit them regularly to the Government and to IFAD. The unit will also prepare
consolidated financial statements each year on the programme operations, resources
and expenditures. The financial management risk for PRODEFI is deemed moderate.

37. Procurement. The works, goods and specialized or consulting services required to
implement the programme and funded under the financing agreement, as amended
where applicable, will be provided in accordance with the procurement code
prevailing in Burundi. A procurement plan based on the AWP/B and stipulating
procurement methods, estimated costs and timelines will be prepared each year at
the national and regional levels.

38. Governance. To apply the principles of good governance and transparency in
programme implementation, the decentralized territorial collectivities will take part
in the planning process and in the monitoring of results.

39. M&E tools in the form of feedback and participatory evaluation workshops will be
built into the planning and M&E system to ensure beneficiaries transparency and
opportunities for continual feedback and to ensure that their recommendations are
taken into account in implementation.

E. Supervision
40. The programme will be supervised jointly by IFAD and the Government of Burundi.

One or two supervision missions will take place each year, in addition to missions in
support of implementation as activities are carried out. In addition, four internal
management control mission (quarterly audits) will be held each year at the central
and regional levels. A midterm review will be conducted jointly by IFAD and the
Government at the end of year three.

IV. Programme cost, financing, benefits
A. Programme cost
41. PRODEFI-II is being financed by a DSF grant from IFAD in the amount of US$36.6

million and an ASAP grant in the amount of US$4.9 million, cofinancing from the



EB 2015/115/R.6

6

Government of Burundi in the amount of US$3.1 million and a contribution in cash
and in kind from beneficiaries in the amount of US$0.3 million. Investment
expenditures are US$40.9 million, or 91.5 per cent of total cost, and recurring
expenditures are US$3.8 million, or 8.5 per cent of total cost. This is attributable to
the fact that the PRODEFI team already in place will be responsible for implementing
the second phase.

42. The DSF grant provided by IFAD represents 81.8 per cent of the total investment

and the ASAP grant 11 per cent. Cofinancing from the Government is estimated at
approximately 6.5 per cent of total investment, mainly in the form of tax waivers
and a contribution to the monitoring costs of the programme.

43. The beneficiaries will make a financial contribution to certain investments, including
those intended to add value to agricultural products. They will also contribute to
some development work such as levelling. The contribution of beneficiaries
represents 0.6 per cent of total additional costs.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
44. Benefits. Development of paddy production in wetlands. Crop intensity with

and without the programme is 0.7 and 1, respectively. Rice generates annual
revenues of US$169 per ha, or US$0.46 per day on average, with economic value
addition of labour equal to US$3.04 per day worked. In total, an average plot of 0.28
ha generates US$67.92 per ha per year without the programme compared to
US$88.3 in the scenario with the programme. Additional paddy production will be
about 10,000 tonnes annually.

45. Development of paddy transformation. Two improved huskers are to be
installed. The quantity of paddy that could be processed by the two huskers planned
is 8,000 tonnes per year, with a maximum of 15 per cent broken grains. The huskers
to be installed with the new financing will have a theoretical production capacity of
5,205 tonnes of superior quality rice per year (realistic scenario), reduced by 20 per
cent to come closer to reality in financial and economic analysis. This represents a
total increase in capacity for paddy transformation of 6,000 tonnes per year. The
husking units will generate net annual revenues of US$140,550, for an annual
increase of US$122,746.

46. Increase in milk production. The new financing will make it possible to purchase
and put to work 3,000 cattle by the end of the programme in 2021. Total milk
production will be about 4,000 tonnes per year – 40 per cent for self-consumption
and 60 per cent for sale.

47. Development of milk marketing. Four 1,000 litre capacity and two 500 litre
capacity milk collection centres will be created with the new financing. This new
financing will therefore make it possible to increase collection and storage capacity
by four tonnes per day, or 1,460 tonnes of fresh milk per year.

48. Employment benefits. Agricultural intensification will enable a high proportion of
small and medium-sized farmers to increase their incomes. Intensification will also
result in increased labour needs for these farms. The increase in work days will
initially reduce underemployment at the family level and then at the local level, as
wage workers are hired.

49. Improvements in employment and incomes for women and young people.
PRODEFI-II proposes to reach women and young people at the rate of at least 30
per cent for women, including women heads of household (widows), as a priority,
and 30 per cent young entrepreneurs/ farmers, including those who are landless, for
marketing activities and to take employment in marketing agricultural products or
providing services.



EB 2015/115/R.6

50. The programme will provide representatives of farmers organizations with training
and technical support, particularly in the organization and management of wetlands
and watersheds. Better structuring of farmers organizations will ensure sustainability
of the programme impact.

51. Economic and financial analysis (2016-2021). Based on the general
assumptions and financial models used, the financial internal rate of return (FIRR)
for this second phase is 18.5 per cent, which is high for an integrated agricultural
development programme implemented in marginal areas with land and infrastructure
protection problems. Based on the general assumptions and assumptions of pricing
and economic benefits, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the second
phase is 17.3 per cent. Both the FIRR and the EIRR are highly satisfactory as all
financial and economic costs have been taken into consideration while some of the
benefits have not been quantified, such as those relating to ASAP-funded activities
that will bring results over the long term.

D. Sustainability
52. The community and participatory development approach is a guarantee that the

beneficiaries will take ownership of the programme initiatives and achievements.
They will set up management committees responsible for maintaining and properly
managing the investments under the supervision of local authorities, supported in
turn by the programme to enable them to monitor activities following programme
completion.

E. Risk identification and mitigation
53. The risks to PRODEFI-II during implementation include: (i) an uncertain political

situation; (ii) limited capacity of actors to implement the hydro-agricultural
improvements; (iii) structuring and professionalization of organizations, which could
take more time than the programme duration; (iv) the random nature of the quality
of administrative and financial management; (v) deficiencies in terms of financial
reporting; and (vi) the lack of an internal audit function. Risk mitigation measures
are as follows: (i) adoption of a programme approach to recycle programme teams
already familiar with IFAD financial procedures; (ii) strengthening of long-term
international technical assistance for high-cost activities (hydro-agricultural
improvements); (iii) continuity and complementarity between old and new financing
in the same provinces, to develop value chains and build capacity among
organizations; (iv) organized redeployment of the team between the central and
regional levels; (v) establishment of a culture of communicating financial information
to ensure monitoring of management processes, specifically disbursements (reports
generated by accounting software); and (vi) creation of an internal audit unit to be
shared by all IFAD projects in the country to ensure compliance with procedures.

V. Corporate considerations
A. Compliance with IFAD policies
54. PRODEFI-II is aligned with IFAD’s Strategic Framework 2011-2015, in particular with

the objectives of achieving “a natural resource and economic asset base for poor
rural women and men that is more resilient to climate change, environmental
degradation and market transformation” and “access for poor rural women and men
to services to reduce poverty, improve nutrition, raise incomes and build resilience in
a changing environment”.

55. In addition, PRODEFI-II is aligned with the objective of “poor rural women and men
and their organizations able to manage profitable, sustainable and resilient farm and
non-farm enterprises or take advantage of decent work opportunities”.

56. The programme is aligned with IFAD’s policy on rural finance in that it will promote
access by beneficiaries and cooperatives to financial instruments, and with the policy
on gender equality and women’s empowerment as women and young people will



EB 2015/115/R.6

9

benefit from the same services as men. It is also aligned with the policy to improve
access to land and land tenure security in providing support for communal land
registration offices to issue land titles.

B. Alignment and harmonization
57. This second phase will also gradually harmonize IFAD-funded project and

programme structures, such as PFCUs, and will take another step towards setting up
the five regional facilitation and coordination units following the first phase of
creating two regional coordination offices as part of implementing PNSADR-IM (one
in the west for the provinces of Bubanza and Cibitoke and one in the east for the
provinces of Cankuzo, Rutana and Ruyigi). PRODEFI-II will be the third programme,
after PAIVA-B (additional financing) and PNSADR-IM, to align itself with the IFAD
country programme approach.

C. Innovation and scaling up
58. Innovations introduced under PRODEFI warrant scaling up during this second phase

and beyond. Among them are integrating nutritional activities and linking them to
agricultural intensification, and integrating rural youth employment activities with
value chain development. These two innovations, as well as those under the Project
to Accelerate Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (PROPA-O) relating
to nutrition, could be integrated systematically in future projects and programmes
and lay the groundwork for drafting national legislation.

D. Policy engagement
59. The main contribution by PRODEFI-II to policy engagement will be through

implementation of subcomponent 1.2, which calls for establishing design standards
for infrastructure (hydro-agricultural improvements, tracks and storage
warehouses).

60. Moreover, PRODEFI-II will contribute to operationalizing the national youth
employment strategy developed under the rural youth employment component and
adopted by Parliament.

VI. Legal instruments and authority
61. A financing agreement between the Republic of Burundi and IFAD will constitute the

legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the beneficiary country. A
copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as an appendix.

62. The Republic of Burundi is empowered under its laws to receive financing from IFAD.

63. I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Lending Policies and Criteria.

VII. Recommendation
64. I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of

the following resolution:

RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a grant under the Debt Sustainability
Framework to the Republic of Burundi in the amount of twenty-six million one
hundred thousand special drawing rights (SDR 26,100,000), and upon such
terms and conditions as shall be substantially in accordance with the terms and
conditions presented herein.

RESOLVED FURTHER: that the Fund shall provide a grant under the Adaptation
for Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP) to the Republic of Burundi in an
amount equivalent to three million five hundred ten thousand special drawing
rights (SDR 3,510,000), and upon such terms and conditions as shall be
substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions presented herein.

Annexe 1

Description du Programme et Dispositions relatives à l’exécution

I. Description du Programme

1. Population cible. Les bénéficiaires directs et indirects du Programme sont des
groupes sociaux identifiés en fonction de critères de pauvreté, d’accès aux ressources et
d’insécurité alimentaire. Ils sont répartis en cinq grands groupes: les ménages ou
personnes sans terre ou ne disposant que d’un accès très limité à celle-ci; les ménages
ou personnes disposant d’un accès limité à la terre mais sans surplus pour les marchés;
les ménages disposant d’un accès à la terre et qui participent déjà dans la production de
cultures pour le marché; les ménages pratiquant une ou plusieurs cultures de rente; et
les ménages disposant d’un accès à la terre et d’animaux en stabulation. Au sein de ces
groupes, des catégories spéciales seront ciblées d’une manière plus spécifique, il s’agit des
jeunes, hommes et femmes; des femmes veuves et orphelins chefs de famille; et  des
membres de l’ethnie minoritaire des Batwa. Ils représentent 77 588 familles au total, dont
33 534 familles bénéficiant directement du Programme. Le Programme touchera huit
provinces du Burundi, à savoir les provinces de Bubanza, Cibitoke, Gitega, Karusi,
Kayanza, Muramvya, Muyinga3 et Ngozi (“la zone du Programme”).

2. Finalité. Le Programme a pour finalité d'augmenter les revenus et améliorer la
sécurité alimentaire des ménages pauvres dans la zone du Programme.

3. Objectifs. Les objectifs du Programme sont de renforcer i) les capacités des petits
agriculteurs pauvres et des jeunes ruraux afin d'augmenter leurs revenus et leur sécurité
alimentaire et nutritionnelle à travers notamment le renforcement des filières agricoles
prioritaires, dont le riz et lait; ii) la résilience des systèmes de production face aux
changements climatiques et iii) un  partenariat durable avec les institutions publiques,
privées et la société civile.

4. Composantes. Les objectifs du Programme seront atteints par la mise en œuvre de
trois composantes: I. Accroissement durable du capital productif et renforcement des
capacités institutionnelles, II. Valorisation et renforcement des filières, et III.
Accompagnement des structures, gestion du savoir et facilitation.

Composante I. Accroissement durable du capital productif et
renforcement des capacités institutionnelles

La composante a pour objectif d’améliorer la sécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle ainsi que
les revenus des ménages grâce à l’augmentation de la productivité et de la production
vivrière et animale consécutive aux aménagements hydro-agricoles, aux activités
d’adaptation aux changements climatiques, à l’intensification agricole, à la structuration
communautaire et à la lutte contre la malnutrition aigüe et chronique. Elle s’articule autour
de cinq sous-composantes:

Sous-composante 1. Aménagements hydro-agricoles et infrastructures.

3 La province de Muyinga ne sera concernée que par l’aménagement du bassin versant de la Ruvubu et
des marais connexes.



Appendix I EB 2015/115/R.6

6

La sous-composante comprend deux volets:

a) l’accroissement de la production du riz et d’autres cultures de marais et de
colline par l’aménagement de nouveaux sites pour permettre une bonne
maîtrise de l’eau d’irrigation; et

b) le désenclavement des sites de marais aménagés à travers la réhabilitation de
pistes existantes afin de faciliter la circulation et l’écoulement des produits.

Sous-composante 2. Adaptation aux changements climatiques.

La sous-composante comprend deux volets:

a) une approche intégrée de gestion des contraintes climatiques à travers des
investissements à l’échelle du bassin versant de la Ruvubu; et

b) une approche au niveau national de renforcement des capacités et des
normes de conception afin que les ouvrages de génie rural installés au
Burundi résistent mieux aux aléas climatiques.

Sous-composante 3. Intensification agricole.

La sous-composante a pour objectif d’améliorer la sécurité alimentaire et les revenus
des ménages au travers de quatre volets:

a) l’accroissement de la production et de la productivité agricoles grâce à
l’utilisation généralisée des intrants agricoles;

b) le repeuplement et le renforcement de la chaîne de solidarité communautaire
animale;

c) l’adoption de nouvelles techniques agricoles; et
d) le renforcement des capacités des agri-éleveurs à travers les champs écoles

fermiers.

Sous-composante 4.    Structuration communautaire inclusive et articulation
institutionnelle.

La sous-composante a pour objectif de renforcer les capacités des institutions
burundaises, publiques et privées comme les Comités de Développement Communautaire
(CDC) et les Comités Communaux de Développement Communautaire (CCDC), pour
qu’elles soient parties prenantes de partenariats de qualité dans un processus de
développement des filières sélectionnées et puissent répliquer les leçons tirées au niveau
national. La sous-composante a également pour objectif de traiter des questions d’appui
aux groupes vulnérables et d’inclusion de la dimension genre dans toutes ses activités.

Sous-composante 5. Lutte contre la malnutrition aigüe et chronique.

La sous-composante a pour objectif de renforcer l'intégration de la prise en charge de la
malnutrition et la promotion nutritionnelle au niveau communautaire afin d'améliorer
durablement l'utilisation et l'accès aux aliments nutritifs locaux.

Composante II. Valorisation et renforcement des filières

La composante vise à renforcer les appuis à la production et à la valorisation des deux
filières principales (le riz et le lait) sur toute la chaîne de valeur et des filières
secondaires.



Appendix I EB 2015/115/R.6

7

Elle s’articule autour des trois sous-composantes:

Sous-composante 1. Cadre organisationnel et financement des filières.

L’objectif de la sous-composante vise à ce que les cycles de production (du semis à la
récolte) et de stockage (de la transformation à la commercialisation) puissent faire l’objet
de prêts différenciés à deux entités distinctes, que sont  le groupement de producteurs qui
va céder sa production et la coopérative qui est l’organisme stockeur. Pour cela, le
Programme va appuyer la mise en place d’instruments financiers adaptés à la zone du
Programme. La mise en œuvre des activités sera confiée à des opérateurs.

Sous-composante 2. Appui aux filières prioritaires et secondaires.

La sous-composante comprend trois volets:

a) appui à la filière prioritaire du lait : l’appui consiste à compléter les
équipements et infrastructures de collecte et de transformation de lait dans les
zones d’intervention du PRODEFI, promouvoir des réseaux de collecte de
proximité et structurer davantage la  plateforme de concertation de la filière
lait.

b) appui à la filière prioritaire du riz : l’appui consiste à installer des infrastructures
de séchage et de stockage ainsi que des équipements de décorticage et à
structurer davantage  la plateforme de concertation  de la filière riz.

c) appui aux filières secondaires que sont le haricot, le maïs et la banane : l’appui
consiste à appuyer les segments de ces filières dans les contextes spécifiques
où il existe un goulet d’étranglement et à mettre en place des équipements et
infrastructures de séchage et de stockage.

Sous-composante 3. Amélioration de l’emploi durable et décent des jeunes ruraux par le
renforcement des structures spécialisées.

La sous-composante comprend trois volets:

a) la mise en place un environnement institutionnel favorable à l’emploi des
jeunes;

b) le renforcement des structures de proximité spécialisées afin qu’elles offrent
des services liés à l'emploi des jeunes principalement dans les filières du
PRODEFI et du PRODEFI-II; et

c) la création et la diversification des emplois et activités génératrices.

Composante III. Accompagnement des structures, gestion du savoir et
facilitation

La composante a pour objectifs la bonne coordination et la gestion saine et transparente du
Programme. Elle s'articule autour de trois sous-composantes:

Sous-composante 1. Renforcement des capacités des acteurs locaux et des unités de
facilitation et de coordination (UFCR) régionales.

Un appui sera apporté pour renforcer les capacités des directions provinciales de
l’agriculture et l’élevage ainsi que les UFCR.



Appendix I EB 2015/115/R.6

8

Sous composante 2. Facilitation, coordination et gestion du Programme au niveau
national.

La coordination générale ainsi qu’une partie des fonctions administrative, financière et de
passation des marchés seront centralisées à Bujumbura et seront réalisées par l’Unité de
Coordination et de Facilitation du Programme (UFCP)  actuelle du PRODEFI.

Les fonctions techniques et l’autre partie des fonctions financière et de passation de
marchés seront décentralisées pour faciliter l’exécution du Programme et le suivi rapproché
des activités.

Clauses particulières

Conformément aux dispositions de la section 12.01 a) des Conditions générales, le Fonds
peut suspendre, en totalité ou en partie, le droit du Bénéficiaire de solliciter des retraits
du compte du don si le Bénéficiaire n’a pas respecté l'une quelconque des clauses
énoncées ci-dessous, et si le FIDA a établi que ladite défaillance a eu, ou risque d'avoir,
un effet préjudiciable important sur le Programme:

1. Suivi et évaluation (S&E). Le Fonds mettra en place un système de missions de
supervision du PRODEFI et du Programme qui seront organisées sur une base annuelle
avec la participation du MINAGRIE. Le système de S&E du Programme s’alignera sur le
système de S&E du PRODEFI. L’étude de la situation de référence du PRODEFI sera
actualisée mais fera ressortir les indicateurs à mesurer pour le Programme.

2. Recrutement. La sélection des cadres supplémentaires à recruter par le
Programme se fera par voie d’appel d’offres national publié dans la presse selon les
procédures actuelles du Bénéficiaire, excluant toute discrimination. Le recrutement de
ces cadres se fera sur la base de contrats renouvelables ne pouvant, en toute hypothèse,
excéder la durée du Programme  et le cas échéant, la décision de rompre leur contrat,
sera décidée en accord avec le Fonds. Le personnel chargé de mettre en œuvre le
PRODEFI  et le Programme sera soumis à des évaluations de performances organisées
annuellement. Il pourra être mis fin à leur contrat en fonction des résultats de ces
évaluations. Le recrutement et la gestion du personnel d’appui seront soumis aux
procédures en vigueur sur le territoire du Bénéficiaire.

3. Égalité. Toute discrimination fondée sur le sexe, l’âge, l’appartenance ethnique ou
religieuse ne sera pas admissible lors du recrutement du personnel du Programme,
conformément aux lois en vigueur sur le territoire du Bénéficiaire. Cependant, le
Bénéficiaire s’engage, à compétence égale, à privilégier les candidatures de femmes,
notamment aux postes techniques à pourvoir dans le cadre du Programme.

Recommendation for approval

The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
loan to the Republic of Madagascar for the Project to Support Development in the
Menabe and Melaky Regions – Phase II (AD2M-II), as contained in paragraph 45.

Proposed loan to the to the Republic of Madagascar for
the Project to Support Development in the Menabe and
Melaky Regions – Phase II (AD2M-II)

I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1. The agricultural sector is the backbone of Madagascar’s national economy,

accounting for 30 per cent of GDP (2009),1 generating 30 to 40 per cent of exports,
and employing 80 per cent of Malagasy families on approximately 2.5 million family
farms. The three subsectors – agriculture, livestock and fisheries – are key to
reducing poverty and enhancing food security; they support 75 per cent of the
country’s population, accounting for 86 per cent of all jobs and 60 per cent of youth
employment. Rice production is the leading economic activity, generating the
income of approximately 10 million inhabitants. Rice is grown by 86 per cent of
households, covering 40 per cent of cropland in use and accounting for 37 per cent
of agricultural cash income.

2. With an annual average growth rate of 1.5 per cent, sector performance remains
weak and is among the major causes of rural poverty. Other causes include
fragmented production, low productivity, rural insecurity, overuse of natural
resources, vulnerability to natural hazards such as cyclones, droughts and floods,
and limited access to economic and commercial opportunities due to isolation,
aging infrastructure and difficulty accessing agricultural markets and rural finance.

3. The 2009-2013 crisis had negative socioeconomic impacts, resulting in increased
poverty and, in particular, extreme poverty. The effects of the crisis were
exacerbated by the suspension of foreign aid, which represented half of the
country's overall budget. Five years of transition and political instability led to a
decline in agricultural productivity, further aggravated in 2012 and 2013 by the
locust infestation, which destroyed as much as 50 per cent of food crops, and
severe drought, which impacted negatively on agricultural production in most
regions. In 2012, the national poverty line2 was, at US$0.67 per person per day,
significantly below the international threshold of US$2. According to the 2015-2019
United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF), the poverty rate
remains high, with 71.5 per cent of people living below the poverty line in 2012.

4. In 2010, 35 per cent of Malagasy households were food insecure, against 25 per
cent in 2005. Acute malnutrition affects 8.6 per cent of children under 5 years of
age, of whom 1.4 per cent are affected severely. Madagascar is among the four
countries in the world with the highest prevalence of chronic malnutrition (47.3
per cent) and ranks fifteenth in terms of the number of children affected (2 million).

B. Rationale and alignment with Government priorities and
RB-COSOP

5. The proposed second phase of the Project to Support Development in the Menabe
and Melaky Regions (AD2M) is justified on three grounds: (i) macroeconomic
considerations; (ii) sector-specific considerations; and (iii) as a tool for achieving
development goals.

6. With regard to the performance of AD2M, agro-economic opportunities and
potential, as yet undeveloped. Key actions include: (i) scaling up good practices;
and (ii) consolidating project benefits through financial allocations under the
2013-2015 performance-based allocation system (PBAS) cycle. Phase II satisfies all
of the criteria required to receive financing from IFAD.

7. Given the risks posed by unpredictable rainfall patterns to the production systems
and populations of Menabe and Melaky, the Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture
Programme (ASAP) Trust Fund will support AD2M Phase II (AD2M-II) by
implementing a strategy focused on the governance of climate risks, and provide
added value to the resilience and adaptation activities to be developed during the
second phase.

II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
8. AD2M-II will target the same geographical area as the first phase of the project,

namely the Menabe and Melaky regions, due to: (i) the existence of significant
agro-economic potential yet to be developed; (ii) the weak coverage of communes3
in these regions during the first phase of the project; and (iii) the desired
economies of scale in terms of approach and project costs. The scope of the project
will be broadened, from 19 to 44 communes, in 7 districts (see appendix II).

9. The target group will be as follows: (i) 35,000 new direct beneficiary households
belonging to one of the three categories of family farm; and (ii) 22,000 households
that already benefited from the first phase and will benefit further from cross-
cutting consolidation activities. A total of 57,000 households will benefit from the
activities to be implemented under the project, comprising small agricultural
producers and rural promoters of economic initiatives operating within the
production poles and the communes linked to them. The number of beneficiaries is
estimated at 342,000, or 58 per cent of the total population (approximately
586,000 people) living in the 44 project area communes.

B. Project development objectives
10. The objectives of AD2M-II are consistent with those of the 2015-2019 country

strategic opportunities programme (COSOP). The overall objective is to sustainably
improve incomes and food security in the productive areas of Menabe and Melaky.
Its specific objectives are to: (i) scale up effective and climate change resilient
family farm production systems; and (ii) enhance producers’ access to
remunerative markets in priority value chains.

C. Components/outcomes
11. The updated technical components of the project comprise: (i) the promotion of

effective and climate change resilient production systems; and (ii) support for
access to markets and economic opportunities.

12. The major outcomes expected are improved water management and water balance
on plots through the redevelopment of 9,120 hectares of hydro-agricultural
schemes and the development of 6,470 hectares of new land, which will result, in
the 44 communes of the project area, in accelerated uptake of various improved
and resilient practices and significant increase in yields and production.

3 Phase I of AD2M covered 19 out of the 88 communes in the two regions.

13. In terms of land tenure security, the expected results are the establishment of
long-term land tenure administrative authorities and structures at the commune or
inter-communal level (20 land offices, a land tenure information and resource
centre, etc.) and safeguards for the land rights of small agricultural producers, so
as to increase investment and improve production methods, yields and incomes.

14. Expected outcomes in terms of input supply and small agricultural equipment
include the production of 250 tons of seed by new seed multiplier famers through
viable businesses integrated into regional and national seed networks, as well as
the provision of effective inputs and equipment to meet the needs of family farms.

15. In terms of marketing, 48 producers’ groups will be organized in order to negotiate
and fulfill production contracts, and 30 per cent of production will be sold on the
basis of written or oral contracts.

16. In terms of rural finance, eight new operational credit unions will be established
and 8,800 people will benefit from credits, including at least 1,000 from credit with
training, 3,200 for shared village granaries, and 4,000 for productive credit.

17. Farmers’ organizations will be operational and provide members with services they
could not obtain individually, especially in collective input supply.

18. Nutrition education sites and family vegetable gardens will be established, helping
at least 1,000 vulnerable farming families with children under 5 years of age to
access a more balanced diet.

19. Four hundred microprojects targeting the most vulnerable households involved in
the management of natural resources and communal village land will be
implemented, scaling collective actions to combat deforestation and environmental
degradation to the village community level so as to foster participatory natural
resource management.

III. Project implementation
ApproachA.

20. The adoption of the so-called “production poles” approach, in widespread use since
the AD2M midterm review, is fully justified in the project area. These should evolve
into “agricultural development poles”, which will form the centrepiece of the second
phase. This approach will comprise the concentration4 of productive investments,
support to agricultural services and efforts to enhance market access focused in
priority areas. It is in line with the project rationale as fine-tuned during the first
phase, incorporating the development of productive infrastructure and the
expansion of arable land, promoting more effective and market-oriented
smallholder farming as well as the organization of producers. Efforts to build the
resilience of cropping systems to climate change must be strengthened in the
second phase. The approach will remain participatory and inclusive.

21. The ASAP grant financing will be used to consolidate the agricultural resilience
benefits of AD2M and to provide the missing link in all poles by securing long-term
investments. The ASAP financing will support in particular production- and
productivity-building activities that are most likely to withstand the impacts of
climate change over the long term while generating immediate socio-economic
benefits.

B. Organizational framework
22. The project will remain under the authority of the Ministry of Agriculture as the lead

implementing agency. The bodies responsible for the coordination and guidance of
the project will remain the same: (i) the National Steering Committee (NSC), which
will ensure project alignment with national strategies; and (ii) the regional
orientation and monitoring committees, which will ensure in particular the

4 This in the context of a large and isolated project area with high potential, taking into account limited financial resources.

alignment of annual work plans and budgets (AWPBs) with the regional priorities in
Menabe and Melaky. The existing Project Management Unit (PMU) will continue
coordination and management, and its staff will be strengthened to take account of
the constraints of expansion into new communes (isolation, poles, etc.). The
performance of both project staff and staff of locally-based partner NGOs will be
evaluated annually against the functions and objectives as set out in the AWPB.

C. Planning, monitoring and evaluation, and learning and
knowledge management

23. The PMU will consolidate AWPBs, prepared in accordance with established standards
and on time. It will be responsible for project implementation and for organizing
and administering the meetings of the regional orientation and monitoring
committees and the NSC. The AWPB will be approved by the NSC and transmitted
to IFAD for approval before the first disbursements are made from the ASAP grant
and IFAD loan.

24. The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system will comprise: i) continuous
systematic internal monitoring, not only to track the implementation of activities
planned in the AWPB but primarily to ensure the attainment of various outcomes
contained in the new project logical framework. A climate change adaptation
specialist with expertise in geographic information system (GIS) and participatory
farmers’ field schools will be recruited (with ASAP financing) to serve as a key
resource throughout the project. Participatory mapping activities involving farmers’
field schools will provide system inputs. The baseline survey for the second phase
of the project will also serve as the impact survey for the evaluation of the first
phase.

25. An M&E plan will be developed to improve the coordination and implementation of
activities. The project M&E manual will be revised to reflect the new provisions and
various improvements to be made to M&E. Monitoring will be participatory so as to
facilitate the transfer and building of development self-management capacities
among the population.

D. Financial management, procurement and governance
26. The manual of administrative, financial and accounting procedures developed

during the first phase will be reviewed and updated. Existing procedures will remain
in place, to be supplemented where necessary. The financial management and
accounting of the project will respect the existing rules and practices applicable to
all IFAD-financed project in Madagascar. The existing accounting software will be
updated and accounting staff will undergo training. Aspects relating to financial
management and flow of funds are detailed in appendix 7 of the project design
report, “Financial management and disbursement systems”.

27. During the second phase, the procurement procedures will be identical to those
already used by AD2M, respecting the applicable rules and general provisions in
this area in Madagascar and IFAD.

E. Supervision
28. The East and Southern Africa Division of IFAD will directly supervise the project.

IFAD and the Government of Madagascar will jointly conduct a midterm review at
the end of the third year. The supervision plan is provided in appendix 6 of the
project design report.

IV. Project costs, financing and benefits
A. Project costs
29. The total project cost, including material and financial contingencies, for the

2016-2022 period is estimated at US$56.7 million.

30. Component 1: Promotion of effective and climate change resilient production
systems, will cost approximately US$40.8 million (72 per cent of the total project

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
32. Based on projections, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the project will

be 14.75 per cent. This EIRR, which is well above the opportunity cost of capital
(8.2 per cent), is satisfactory given that some additional benefits have not been
taken into account, including those generated by support activities (construction,
equipment, training) and those deriving from technical assistance, training,
information and awareness-raising support. Furthermore, the benefits of improving
land tenure security have not been fully reflected since they are difficult to
quantify; these include investments linked to local land tenure plans, socio-land
tenure analysis, land tenure mediation for the allocation of new plots;
strengthening land offices, partner capacities and training on offer; reducing
transaction costs by improving access to financial services and technology; and
improving living standards, hygiene and nutrition among the project target group.

33. In conclusion, the EIRR is robust with respect to changes in costs or benefits, and
remains satisfactory given that it does not take a number of direct and indirect
benefits into account. The sensitivity analysis, calculated over an extended
economic lifecycle of 20 years, assesses the risks that may constrain AD2M-II
implementation as a result of adverse changes in economic or financial conditions,
including increased prices. Under conditions favourable to the project, such as
increased benefits or reduced costs, the EIRR would further exceed the base rate of
14.75 per cent.

D. Sustainability
34. From the outset of AD2M-II, the PMU will develop an exit strategy, which it will

implement, transferring responsibilities to project-supported structures, including
communes and farmers’ organizations. The sustainability of the strategy depends
on the assumption of responsibility by producers. The sustainability of land tenure
security will be guaranteed by its inclusion in a proactive national policy and by the
institutionalization, at all territorial levels, of decentralized structures and specific
implementation modalities. It will remain, nonetheless, dependent on the
sustainability of such structures, especially land offices. The sustainability of
hydro-agricultural developments will depend primarily on the management and
maintenance of irrigation networks. The simple gravity model chosen for irrigation
networks takes into account the weak technical capacity of the management
structure, which relies primarily on users through water users’ associations; such
associations should be involved in the project from the outset, strengthened,
supported and ultimately transferred responsibility for managing irrigation
schemes.

E. Risk identification and mitigation
35. The major risks relate to governance, the severity of the climate, the destructive

effects of climate change on social and production capital of small producers, locust
infestation and physical insecurity, especially cattle rustling. Administrative and
financial management risks are considered low, relating primarily to the lack of an
operational internal audit system for IFAD projects in Madagascar. A detailed table
of risks and mitigation measures is presented in chapter III, F and in appendix 4 of
the project design report.

V. Corporate considerations
Compliance with IFAD policiesA.

36. AD2M-II project design is aligned with IFAD’s mandate and Strategic Framework
2011-2015. Project activities are aligned with IFAD’s Madagascar COSOP
2015-2019, in particular strategic objective 1: the widespread adoption of effective
and climate change resilient production systems.

Alignment and harmonizationB.
37. The AD2M-II objectives are aligned with: (i) the General Government Policy,

adopted in May 2014; (ii) the 2015-2019 National Development Plan; (iii) the
2015-2025 Agriculture, Livestock and Fishery Sectoral Programme, based on the
priorities and commitments agreed upon by the main sector stakeholders under the
National Pact, which marked Madagascar’s official accession to the Comprehensive
Africa Agriculture Development Programme; and (iv) the National Policy to Combat
Climate Change. The AD2M-II objectives are consistent with the 2015-2019 UNDAF
objectives, since the project will contribute substantively to the five pillars of
economic and social development.

Innovations and scaling upC.
38. The first phase of the project resulted in the adoption of numerous innovations in

the project area. The results have been satisfactory and the following innovations
will be scaled up during the second phase: i) farmers’ field schools; ii)
agro-ecological techniques recently introduced and popularized by the project
through farmers’ field schools; iii) off-season growing for vulnerable smallholders
with no irrigated land; and iv) the taxation, identification and certification combined
operation approach in project-supported land offices.

39. The learning process will continue, in particular by capitalizing on experiences and
instituting systematic exchanges with other rural development stakeholders,
especially projects financed by IFAD and other technical and financial partners
(such as the Japan International Cooperation Agency Central Highlands Rice
Productivity Improvement Project and the World Bank Emergency Food Security

and Social Protection Project). The project will benefit from knowledge built in
similar areas by other successful projects in the country: i) access to markets and
marketing (the Rural Income Promotion Programme and the Support Porgramme
for Rural Microenterprises and Regional Economies); and ii) agricultural advisory
services and the strengthening of professional organizations.

40. Climate change adaptation is also among the key themes. The ASAP financing will
help strengthen activities aimed at building farmers’ resilience to the effects of
climate change: hydro-agricultural development, including spate-irrigated areas,
reforestation, agro-ecology and natural resource management approaches in
general. Project implementation will thus provide the knowledge base and solid
expertise to replicate and expand the application of alternative activities to build
resilience to climate change.

Policy engagementD.
41. AD2M-II is anchored in the economy and the institutional environment at the

communal and regional levels. It promotes decentralization and the organization of
stakeholders at the local level so as to ensure the sustainability of investments. The
project incorporates activities relating to policy consultation, capacity-building,
farmers’ organizations, land tenure security, rural finance and knowledge
management.

VI. Legal instruments and authority
42. A project financing agreement between the Republic of Madagascar and IFAD will

constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the
borrower. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as appendix 1.
session.

43. The Republic of Madagascar is empowered under its laws to receive financing from
IFAD.

44. I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.

VII. Recommendation
45. I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of

the following resolution:

RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on highly concessional terms to
Republic of Madagascar in an amount equivalent to twenty-four million five
hundred thousand special drawing rights (SDR 24,500,000), and upon such
terms and conditions as shall be substantially in accordance with the terms
and conditions presented herein.

FURTHER RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a grant to the Republic of
Madagascar through the Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme in

Description du Projet et Dispositions relatives à l’exécution

I. Description du Projet

1. Zone du Projet. Le Projet interviendra dans les mêmes régions que le Projet d’Appui
au Développement du Menabe et Melaky (AD2M) et élargira son champ d'action à 25
communes portant le nombre total de communes à 44.

2. Populations cibles. Le Projet ciblera les exploitations agricoles familiales (EAF) selon
une typologie des EAF en trois niveaux, à savoir : i) les EAF de type 1  tournées vers le
marché; ii) les EAF de type 2 en situation d’autosuffisance alimentaire; et iii) les EAF de
type 3 conjoncturellement ou chroniquement déficitaires en produits vivriers, en
conformité avec le COSOP et les documents de référence nationaux. La population cible
comprend 57 000 ménages. Le Projet touchera environ 342 000 bénéficiaires directs.

3. Finalité. L’objectif global est de contribuer à l' amélioration durable des revenus et
de la sécurité alimentaire des exploitations agricoles des régions du Menabe et Melaky.

4. Objectifs. Les objectifs spécifiques sont i) l'adoption à large échelle de systèmes de
production des EAF performants et résilients au changement climatique et; ii)
l'amélioration de l' accès des producteurs aux marchés rémunérateurs dans le cadre de
filières prioritaires.

5. Composantes. Les objectifs du Projet sont structurés autour des trois
composantes et sous-composantes suivantes :

Composante 1:  Promotion des systèmes de production performants et résilients
au changement climatique

La composante a pour objectif la valorisation durable des systèmes de cultures pratiqués
sur les périmètres irrigués, les terres de baiboho et de tanety.

Sous composante 1.1 : Développement d'infrastructures productives résilientes

La sous-composante sera articulée autour de 2 volets :
1.1.1. Planification territoriale (plan communal de développement et schéma
d’aménagement communal); et
1.1.2. Aménagements hydro-agricoles.

Sous composante 1.2 : Organisation et formation des producteurs

Les activités de la sous composante porteront sur l’appui à l'organisation et la formation
des producteurs, notamment en ce qui concerne la gestion des moyens communs de
production et l’éducation nutritionnelle.



Appendix I EB 2015/115/R.8

Sous composante 1.3 : Appui aux services agricoles

La sous-composante sera articulée autour de 4 volets :
1.3.1. Sécurisation foncière;

1.3.2. Conseil agricole et appui à la gestion des ressources naturelles;

1.3.3. Appui à l’accès de proximité des producteurs aux intrants et petit matériel
agricole; et

1.3.4. Microprojets aux plus vulnérables.

Composante 2: Appui à l'accès aux marchés et aux opportunités économiques

La composante a pour objectifs de renforcer la viabilité économique des investissements
réalisés au niveau des pôles par des actions d’accompagnement appropriés, tant en
amont qu’en aval de la production.

Sous composante 2.1 : Infrastructures de désenclavement, stockage et
valorisation des produits

La sous-composante sera articulée autour de 2 volets :
2.1.1 Infrastructures de désenclavement; et
2.1.2 Infrastructures de stockage et de valorisation des produits.

Il est envisagé dans le cadre de cette sous-composante l'amélioration de l'accès aux
bassins de production, la consolidation et le développement du transport fluvial pour le
désenclavement des bassins de production , ainsi que le renforcement de la chaîne post-
récolte afin de consolider l’autonomie et la croissance économique des producteurs.

Sous composante 2.2 : Appui aux organisations paysannes, au partenariat
organisations paysannes (OP)/ opérateurs de marché (OM) et accès aux
services financiers

La sous-composante sera articulée autour de 2 volets :
2.2.1 Organisation professionnelle des producteurs et appui au partenariat
OP/OM; et
2.2.2 Finance rurale.

Il est envisagé dans le cadre de cette sous-composante qu’environ 48 groupements de
producteurs soient organisés et capables de négocier et honorer des contrats de
production, que 30% de la production soit vendue sur la base de relations contractuelles
écrites ou orales. En outre, il est envisagé que 8 nouvelles caisses deviennent
opérationnelles et que 8 800 personnes bénéficient de crédits.

Composante 3: Coordination, Gestion du Projet et suivi-évaluation

La coordination et la gestion restent assurées par l' unité de gestion du Projet (UGP) en
place dans le cadre d’AD2M, dont l'effectif actuel sera complété pour prendre en
considération les contraintes liées à l’extension dans les nouvelles communes dans le
cadre du Projet.

Les procédures de gestion seront identiques à celles en vigueur dans le cadre d’AD2M et
établies dans le manuel des procédures administratives, financières, budgétaires et



Appendix I EB 2015/115/R.8

8

comptables d'AD2M. Les procédures de passation de marché seront celles utilisées dans
le cadre d’AD2M, conformément aux règles de passation de marchés du gouvernement et
du Fonds.

Le système de suivi-évaluation sera fondé sur un suivi interne systématique et
permanent, dans le but de suivre la mise en œuvre des activités prévues aux
programmes de travail et budget annuels (PTBA), ainsi que l’obtention des différents
résultats définis par le cadre logique du Projet. L’enquête de base du Projet correspondra
à l’enquête d’impact pour l’évaluation d’AD2M, complétée par une enquête de situation
de référence dans les 25 communes additionnelles. Le don du Fonds Fiduciaire ASAP
renforcera l’UGP à travers l’intégration du Système d’Information Géographique (SIG)
comme espace de planification en finançant les renforcements de capacités et les
équipements nécessaires. Le système sera alimenté à travers des activités de
cartographie participative et l’implication des Champs Ecoles Paysans (CEP). La Cellule
d'appui au programme FIDA (CAPFIDA) appuiera le Projet au niveau de la capitalisation
des expériences et des savoirs, et de la consolidation des résultats au niveau du
Programme-pays.

B. MISE EN ŒUVRE DU PROJET ET PARTENARIAT

4. Approche

4.1 Le Projet adoptera une approche par  « pôles de développement agricole », à savoir
une approche de concentration d’investissements productifs, d’appui aux services
agricoles et à l'accès aux marchés, dans des bassins prioritaires. Elle suit la logique
d'intervention affinée dans le cadre d’AD2M, en intégrant l’aménagement
d'infrastructures productives et l’extension des terres cultivables, la promotion d'une
agriculture paysanne plus performante et tournée vers le marché, et l’organisation des
producteurs. La résilience des systèmes de cultures au changement climatique sera une
dimension importante du Projet.



Appendix I EB 2015/115/R.8

10

4.2 L'approche demeurera participative et inclusive, en ce sens qu' elle responsabilise
les bénéficiaires tout au long du processus (diagnostic, planification, mise en œuvre,
suivi), réserve un mécanisme d’inclusion des groupes vulnérables (microprojets aux plus
vulnérables, accès à la terre, crédit avec éducation) et  capitalise sur les leçons apprises
et les acquis d’AD2M.

5. Mise en œuvre

5.1. Le Projet continuera à pratiquer  une politique de "faire-faire'". La mise en œuvre
des activités du Projet sera confiée à des organismes partenaires ou prestataires de
services spécialisés (organisations non-gouvernementales de terrain (ONGT), bureaux
d'études, entreprises privées, services techniques déconcentrés), selon les besoins. Au
niveau des ONGT, l’effectif actuel des socio-organisateurs sera ajusté en tenant compte
des spécificités de la zone du Projet. L'UGP sera associée à la sélection des techniciens,
qui devront disposer d'une expérience pratique reconnue en développement agricole.

5.2 En outre, il est prévu que les activités du Projet soient mises en œuvre rapidement
au travers de la mise en chantier d'une première vague de travaux d’aménagements
hydro-agricoles et de la disponibilité des ONGT ayant déjà une bonne connaissance
d’AD2M, et disposant de bonnes capacités dans la zone du Projet.

6. Partenariat

Les partenaires pour l’exécution du Projet seront, notamment, les suivants:

i) l'Union Européenne pour la réhabilitation d'une portion de la route nationale
tertiaire RNT8 reliant les deux chefs-lieux de régions, facilitant l'accès à des

Recommendation for approval

The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
loan to the People’s Republic of Bangladesh for the National Agricultural Technology
Programme – Phase II Project, as contained in paragraph 55.

Proposed loan to the National Agricultural Technology
Programme – Phase II Project for the People’s Republic
of Bangladesh

I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1. Building on its remarkable social and economic performance over the past 20

years, the People’s Republic of Bangladesh aims to become a middle-income
country by 2021; achieving this will require that the Government of Bangladesh
overcome considerable challenges in agricultural development and rural economic
growth. The country’s annual GDP growth averaged about 6 per cent between 2000
and 2013, accompanied by a decline in the national poverty headcount rate from
48.9 to 31.5 per cent over the first decade of the century, effectively lifting some
16 million people out of poverty.

2. Bangladesh, a country of over 160 million inhabitants, has also made noteworthy
gains in education and health, and is well set to achieve most of the Millennium
Development Goals. Despite these gains, it remains a poor country, with a 2013
GDP per capita of about US$1,000. Bangladesh is regularly hit by natural disasters
that severely impact the economy, disproportionally affecting the infrastructure
and agriculture sectors, as well as vulnerable groups. Nutrition outcomes have not
kept pace with the progress achieved with most social and economic indicators.

3. Agriculture covers about three quarters of the country’s scarce land and supports
the majority of the population’s livelihoods. While overall poverty has significantly
declined over the last decade, the poverty headcount in rural areas (still around 35
per cent) has not declined as fast as in urban settings; and the proportion of
people living in extreme poverty in rural areas is still three times higher than in
urban areas.

4. Agriculture’s contribution to the country’s economic output has declined over the
past decade, but crops, livestock, forestry and fisheries still account for 17 per cent
of GDP. Some 67 per cent of the population live in rural areas and over 43 per cent
of the country’s total labour force are engaged in agriculture. Therefore, achieving
further socially and environmentally sustainable economic growth and poverty
reduction will require policies and investments conducive to lasting
transformational changes in rural areas – including through technological
innovation in agriculture.

B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and RB-
COSOP

5. While the performance of the National Agricultural Research System (NARS) has
been impressive in contributing to food security (particularly with rice), research in
some key subsectors (e.g. livestock, fisheries) has yet to reach its potential
productivity in terms of releasing a sufficient stream of useful innovations
(including a range of new climate-smart technologies for production and post-
harvest). The proposed National Agricultural Technology Programme (NATP) – the
second phase of three projects initially planned – will seek to overcome some of

the key constraints still holding back the NARS, and to add greater value to the
output of the agricultural sector.

6. The NATP phase two (NATP-II) project is fully aligned with the government’s
priorities, in particular with: (i) the Perspective Plan 2010-2021 outlining the
strategy for achieving food security, making adequate infrastructure available and
pursuing environmentally friendly development; (ii) the Sixth Five-Year Plan (6th
FYP) identifying focal sectors for pro-poor growth, including agriculture, livestock,
community-based fisheries and rural finance; (iii) the policy framework of the
National Agricultural Extension Policy (NAEP, 2012); and (iv) the Bangladesh
Agricultural Research Council (BARC, 2011).

7. Being agriculture-centric, the NATP-II project will complement the ongoing IFAD-
funded portfolio in Bangladesh and is fully aligned with the country strategic
opportunities programme’s (COSOP) objectives of achieving: (i) better adapted
livelihoods of poor people in vulnerable areas to climate change; (ii) greater
market access and improved value chains for small producers and entrepreneurs;
and (iii) economic and social empowerment for marginalized groups, including poor
rural women.

II. Programme description
A. Project area and target group
8. Project area. The three-phase programme will cover all of the 64 districts by the

third phase. In this context, NATP-II will cover 57 districts (including the 25
covered by NATP-I) and span a broad range of agroecological zones across
Bangladesh. The project will be implemented over a six-year period in up to 270
subdistricts (or upazillas); this includes 120 already covered under NATP-I, plus up
to 150 new upazillas. New upazillas will be selected following the multicriteria
approach successfully applied under NATP-I (including poverty incidence, high
prevalence of marginal farmers and agroecologically stressed areas).

9. Target group. In compliance with government policies and strategies, the primary
target group for NATP-II will be smallholder farmers: particularly small, marginal
and landless farmers. Special emphasis will be placed on targeting women.

B. Programme development objective
10. The development objective of this project is to increase agricultural productivity of

smallholder farms and improve smallholder farmers’ access to markets in selected
districts. This will be achieved by: (i) strengthening the capacity of the NARS and
the extension services to generate and diffuse agricultural technologies aimed at
increasing farm productivity and reducing post-harvest losses; and (ii) promoting
the sustainability of existing and newly created farmer groups and producer
organizations by facilitating their linkages with markets.

C. Components/outcomes
11. Component 1: Enhancing agricultural technology generation. Component 1

will improve the performance of NARS through the support to agricultural
technology development, and the strengthening of agricultural research institutions
(institutional and human capacity). Research will be funded through competitive
grants. The component will also finance a number of activities (including specific
studies, policy notes, training, research-extension linkages, and others) in support
of the implementation of the 2012 BARC Act approved under NATP.

12. To scale up NATP achievements, the project design includes – embedded in the
different project components – an agricultural innovation fund (AIF). The AIF is at
the core of the NATP-II scale-up strategy; it aims to provide grant funding for
eligible research and microproject proposals to be implemented by potential project
beneficiaries. The AIF is fully aligned with the holistic approach to agricultural
innovation promoted by the project. In order to effectively contribute to achieving

the project development objective, the AIF includes the following three funding
windows: (i) AIF-1 (US$26.2 million) will promote agricultural technology
generation through a programme-based research initiative (AIF-1 PBRG) and a
competitive research grant programme (AIF-1 CRG); (ii) AIF-2 (US$17 million),
through matching grants, will promote farmers’ adoption of innovative technologies
generated by the research community; and (iii) AIF-3 (US$4.6 million),
through matching grants, will support private operators in developing business and
market opportunities for farmers, as well as in providing relevant private services
to farmers. NATP-II will use calls for proposals, scientific and technical peer-
reviewing and transparent selection mechanisms for the allocation of all grants
under the AIF; disbursement against the AIF is subject to the Bank’s approval of an
AIF Manual of Operational Guidelines and Procedures. NATP-II will explore
synergies between its AIF and the access to rural financial services promoted under
IFAD’s new project for Promoting Agricultural Commercialization and Enterprises
(PACE).1

13. Component 2: Supporting crop development. Component 2 will increase farm
yields, diversify agricultural production, and improve market linkages for
smallholder farmers by: (i) improving the outreach and quality of crop extension
and advisory services by strengthening the skills of public extension workers from
the Department of Agricultural Extension; (ii) promoting information and
communication technology (ICT) in agricultural extension services and supporting
farmer-to-farmer extension; (iii) developing farmers’ skills to scale up the
dissemination of good agricultural practices including those developed under NATP,
as well as identifying technologies for a sustainable production of safer food;
(iv) promoting farm and off-farm mechanization to increase crop productivity, farm
output and diversification, as well as to increase efficiency in crop handling, reduce
post-harvest losses and support processing; (v) facilitating stronger collaboration
with the private sector for agribusiness development on agroprocessing, market
access for smallholders, as well as for the establishment of machinery hire-
services; and (vi) strengthening institutions involved in the crop sector, through
capacity development and selected investments in infrastructure.

14. Component 3: Supporting fisheries development. Component 3 will promote
productivity, quality and output increases through technology transfer, as well as a
better access to market opportunities for fish farmers. NATP-II will provide support
for the sustainable development of inland culture fisheries (small-scale aquaculture
ponds) and inland capture fisheries (open water fisheries in beels [a lake-like
wetland with static water] and haors [a hoar may host several beels]) by (i) scaling
up NATP good aquaculture practices for the production systems prevailing in the
project area; (ii) promoting community-based fisheries management; (iii)
supporting the participation of fisheries common interest groups (CIGs) and
partner organizations (POs) in value chains; (iv) reinforcing research-extension-
farmer linkages; and (v) strengthening the capacity of fisheries institutions. NATP-
II will explore linkages with fishery activities under the ongoing IFAD-supported
operations in the haors.

15. Component 4: Supporting livestock development. Component 4 will promote
productivity and output increases through enhanced technology transfer, service
delivery, as well as better access for livestock farmers to markets. Activities under
this component will cover dairy farming, goat rearing, beef fattening, and poultry
farming, and focus on: (i) strengthening livestock institutions, improving livestock
extension services, and reinforcing the linkages between research, extension and
livestock farmers; (ii) scaling up outreach programmes to a larger number of

microentrepreneurs, and creating wage employment for extreme and moderatly poor people. PACE will provide NATP-II
finance groups with business planning/development services to prepare business plans for funding through PACE's
microenterprise loan programme. In addition, crop, fisheries and livestock farmers unable to access NATP-II matching
grants could be referred to PACE loan schemes.

farmers; and (iii) facilitating the participation of smallholder farmers in selected
livestock markets.

16. Component 5: Project management. Activities under this component will:
(i) ensure that the project is carried out in line with the provisions in the official
project documents, in particular all fiduciary and governance aspects; (ii) establish
liaison mechanisms between the World Bank and the project, and between the
project and the Government of Bangladesh, and (iii) coordinate the implementation
of selected overarching project activities with the support of external technical
assistance.

III. Programme implementation
A. Approach
17. NATP-II will build on and scale up successful interventions and address important

lessons learned from NATP-I. The integrated approach to reaching the project
development objectives will include a foundational component that contributes
towards decentralized, demand-driven agricultural research, as the basis for an
enhanced agricultural technology system. The project will include a further three
subsector components (crops, livestock and fisheries) to address a range of
constraints to technology generation, technology transfer and adoption at farm
level, and farmers’ access to markets. This approach is expected to lead to an
enhanced linkage between agricultural research, extension, and production – an
area regularly reported under NATP as requiring further improvement.

B. Organizational framework
18. The representative of the borrower is the Ministry of Finance. NATP-II will be

implemented under the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture (lead
implementing agency) and the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock. It will be fully
integrated into the Government of Bangladesh administration, and project
implementation is designed to promote the use of existing government structures
at the central level and, when available, at decentralized levels.

19. A joint steering committee, composed of senior representatives from the
agencies under the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock
involved in project implementation, as well as representatives from the farmers
and private sector, who will provide strategic guidance, approve annual budget and
activity plans, monitor overall implementation progress, facilitate interagency
coordination and resolve any outstanding issues requiring high-level decisions.

20. Project management unit. A small project management unit (PMU) will be set up
to oversee implementation of project activities, carry out day-to-day project
management functions, facilitate coordination among components, and liaise with
the World Bank on all project implementation-related aspects. The PMU will also be
in charge of project monitoring and evaluation, producing a project implementation
manual (PIM) that is acceptable to the development partners, detailing the
operational, financial and administrative procedures of NATP-II. The PMU will also
be responsible for the implementation of component 5.

21. Project implementation units. All other project components will be integrated in
the corresponding line department (or agency); each department/agency will set
up a component-specific project implementation unit (PIU). Under the Ministry of
Agriculture, BARC and the Department of Agricultural Extension will each set up a
PIU; BARC for the implementation of component 1 (agricultural technology
generation) and the Department of Agricultural Extension for component 2 (crops).
Under the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock, the Department of Fisheries will set
up a PIU for the implementation of component 3 (fisheries) and the Department of
Livestock Services will set up a PIU for component 4 (livestock). Using project
funds, the Department of Fisheries, Department of Livestock Services and BARC
will recruit service providers (e.g. international institutions, agro-consulting firms,

academia or others) to deliver the technical assistance needed for strengthening
their institutional capacity and supporting their PIUs with the implementation of
component-specific activities.

C. Planning, monitoring and evaluation, and learning and
knowledge management

22. Planning. The PMU will be responsible for preparing the annual work plan and
budget, getting it approved by the Ministry of Finance and cleared by the World
Bank. The plan will include planned activities along with targets and expenditures
and will reflect the general project targets and activities.

23. Monitoring and evaluation. NATP-II will have a multi-tier results monitoring and
impact evaluation system that will inform on the progress made towards achieving
the development objective. Results will be sex-disaggregated reported as much as
possible to capture the gender dimension of NATP-II.

24. Learning and knowledge management. Knowledge sharing and learning is a
key activity throughout all of NATP-II’s components. The project will utilize ICT for
extension and capacity-building purposes, and further aims to build an agriculture
knowledge repository and a knowledge platform under its ICT initiative. Another
important tool will be the farmers information and advisory centres that will serve
as fully equipped agricultural technology and knowledge-sharing centres.

D. Financial management, procurement and governance
25. A fiduciary assessment of NATP-II was carried out during design, and follows World

Bank procedures. The fiduciary assessment rated the risk in financial management
(FM) as “substantial”, due to (i) the involvement of multiple PIUs and accounting
centres; (ii) the timeliness of consolidation of FM reports; and (iii) compliance with
the requirements of multiple donors. Risk-mitigating measures have been
incorporated into the design of the FM implementation arrangements, and a
number of additional measures will be taken to ensure overall FM capacity and
performance.

26. NATP-II will hire an experienced consultant for the PMU (a senior financial
management specialist), with qualifications acceptable to the Bank and IFAD, to
lead and coordinate FM activities. The consultant will support the project in
strengthening budgeting practices, internal controls, fund reconciliations, and other
relevant financial functions, including coordination with the FM staff at the PIUs.
The current manual system of accounting will be enhanced within 12 months of
project effectiveness by a computerized FM information system to facilitate easy
and timely access to financial information and its consolidation. In order to ensure
that clear practices are harmonized across the project, the PIM will include all the
relevant parts of FM operations, donors’ compliance and financial disclosure. Prior
to effectiveness, the project will also adopt an online, off-the-shelf, web-enabled
accounting software. Annual external audits of all project components will be
conducted by the Foreign Aided Project Audit Directorate and will be supplemented
by additional internal audits from an independent audit firm (twice in the project
lifetime).

27. Flow of funds. Financing from the International Development Association (IDA),
IFAD and a USAID trust fund will be disbursed through three separate designated
accounts. These will be opened and operated by the PMU. All PIUs will maintain a
designated operating account to receive funds from the PMU. The IFAD loan will be
administered by the World Bank under a cooperation agreement with IFAD. An
initial advance will be provided and will be replenished based on regular statements
of expenditure. The same method will be applied between the PMU and PIUs. After
the first year of implementation, the Bank will review the FM performance and, in
consultation with IFAD, may recommend converting the disbursement modality to

one based on interim unaudited financial reports, including a six-monthly forecast
of fund requirements.

28. Project-related transactions relating to all funding sources (IDA, USAID, IFAD and
the Government of Bangladesh) will be accounted for separately in the PMU
following double-entry bookkeeping principles and on a cash basis. The key project
accounting functions for which the PMU will be responsible are as follows:
(i) budget preparation and monitoring; (ii) payments for eligible project
expenditure to third parties; (iii) disbursement of project funds to various agencies,
as per approved work plan; (iv) maintenance of books and bank accounts; (v) cash
flow management; (vi) financial reporting to the Government of Bangladesh, the
World Bank, IFAD and other stakeholders; (vii) preparation of withdrawal
applications to claim funds from the World Bank and IFAD; and (viii) assistance to
the external auditor and ensuring appropriate follow-up of audit. Details on the
proposed FM and disbursement arrangements can be found in annex 3 of the World
Bank’s Project Appraisal Document.

29. Procurement. Procurement financed under the project will be carried out in
accordance with the World Bank’s “Guidelines: Procurement of Goods, Works and
Non-Consulting Services under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants by World
Bank Borrowers” dated July 2014 (Procurement Guidelines) and “Guidelines:
Selection and Employment of Consulting Services under IBRD Loans and IDA
Credits and Grants by World Bank Borrowers” dated July 2014 (Consultant
Guidelines), and the provisions stipulated in the financing agreement. The
procurement method will depend on the nature of the expenditure and the value of
the contract. The PMU and all PIUs will preserve all procurement records and
documents in accordance with provisions of the Public Procurement Act 2006 (PPA
2006).

30. Procurement under NATP-II will be guided by the World Bank-approved
procurement plan and processed through pooled procurement by the PMU for
selected goods and services (e.g. ICT equipment and peripherals, furniture and
office equipment, consultant services to be provided across various components,
and others) under component 5, and by the four PIUs and the PMU for all other
component-specific goods, works and services. To mitigate procurement risks from
low in-house capacity, the project will contract six procurement specialists
(consultants): two for the PMU and one for each PIU. An acceptable procurement
plan covering the first 18 months of project implementation is available.
Institutional procurement approval will be provided by the respective Head of
Procurement Entities (HOPE) or his/her delegate as per delegation of financial
powers of the four agencies (departments’ Director General and BARC Chairman);
the HOPE for the PMU is the Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture (lead
implementing agency).

31. Audit. The Foreign Aided Projects Audit Directorate of the Comptroller and Auditor
General will conduct an audit of the project’s annual financial statements within six
months from the end of the fiscal year. The project director will be responsible for
audit follow-up and taking remedial actions. Internal audits will include prepayment
audits and independent appraisals of the financial, operational and control activities
in the sector. The responsibilities of the internal auditors will further include
reporting on the adequacy of internal controls, the accuracy and propriety of
transactions, the extent to which assets are accounted for and safeguarded, and
the level of compliance with financial procedures and government laws and
regulations. The first audit will be due by the end of the second year of
implementation.

32. Governance. Lessons learned over the last five years to improve project
implementation and safeguard against potential governance issues have been
incorporated in the project design, implementation arrangements and monitoring

procedures. The project design allows for full and distinct accountability with a
single line agency (BARC, Department of Fisheries and Department of Livestock
Services) for each component. Project monitoring and impact evaluation will be
carried out in collaboration with the PMU and the PIUs by an independent entity
recruited competitively and operating with national and international consultants.
An independent assessment (technical and financial audit) of the AIF will be carried
out for project midterm review to improve the grant system’s performance
accordingly. Beneficiaries’ feedback will be obtained through IT apps tailored to the
project’s needs and channelled directly to the NATP-II management information
system’s area coordinated by the third-party monitoring firm. The project will also
set up project-level grievance redress mechanisms with local communities being
consulted early in the process. In addition, in line with the Bank’s Disclosure Policy
and the country’s Right to Information Act, all information in the project shall be
made public.

33. Several risks and risks mitigation measures related to procurement, financial
management, and environmental and social safeguards compliance have already
been described in the corresponding parts of the project appraisal document. In
order to further minimize governance and corruption risks, NATP-II will follow a
Governance and Accountability Action Plan (GAAP). This plan outlines a framework
for action, institutional arrangements, specific responsibilities, and additional
measures to facilitate effective and appropriate use of project funds. It is based on
the Bank’s and IFAD’s experiences in addressing governance and anticorruption
issues. The GAAP will be adjusted as necessary during implementation to reflect
governance issues that may emerge and/or to strengthen or add actions.

E. Supervision
34. The IFAD loan will be administered and supervised by the World Bank.

IV. Programme costs, financing, benefits
A. Programme costs
35. The total estimated cost of NATP-II amounts to US$214 million (net of beneficiary

contribution), inclusive of contingencies and taxes.

B. Programme financing
36. Of the total cost of US$214 million, US$23.8 million will be financed through an

IFAD loan on highly concessional terms. The World Bank will be providing a loan of
US$176 million and USAID will contribute a grant of US$7.4 million. The
contribution of the Government of Bangladesh, in the form of parallel cofinancing,
will cover all vehicles purchased for NATP-II, as well as the salaries of civil servants
assigned to work full-time on the project, and other expenses.2 The financing of
taxes on eligible expenditures will be permitted with IFAD funds, to harmonize with
IDA practice and simplify the project’s accounting and disbursement procedures.

2 As per the table, the Government of Bangladesh contribution reported amounts to US$6.65 million (or 3 per cent of
project costs). This is likely to be underestimated, as it does not include the hiring by DOF and DLS of upazilla-level
extension staff. However, since this process is underway and has not yet been submitted to the Manpower Committee
(Finance Division/Ministry of Finance), the final number of staff that actually will be recruited is not yet known. Hence, the
exact amount to be added to the reported government contribution is not yet available.

37. In addition, beneficiaries will be required to provide cash contributions towards the
matching grants. Beneficiary contribution is expected to amount to US$6.5 million.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
38. Project benefits. It is estimated that over one million farming households will

directly benefit from project activities, including from improved extension services,
stronger linkages with research, on-farm demonstrations of new technologies,
capacity enhancement through training and skills development, as well as
cofunding productive assets. Based on previous experience, significant spillover
effects and knowledge transfer to farmers who are not members of groups
supported by NATP (the CIGs) can be anticipated. Therefore, all members of the
supported farming communities will potentially benefit from the technologies
generated, the improved extension services provided, as well as from the market
linkages developed. Up to three million farmers in the project area are expected to
benefit from NATP-II. The project will promote gender mainstreaming and women’s
empowerment to ensure that a significant proportion of direct beneficiaries is
female.

39. Economic analysis. The parameters used in making these projections were based
on the NATP-I experience and impact. On this basis, the NATP-II internal rate of
return is calculated at 28 per cent, the project’s economic rate of return (ERR) at
31 per cent, and the corresponding net present value at US$49.9 million. This ERR
remains robust under hypothetical scenarios of a 10 per cent decrease in expected
net revenues and/or a 10 per cent increase in project costs.

D. Sustainability
40. To ensure the durability of the model for technology transfer and delivery of

advisory services to farmers, NATP-II will promote a pluralistic extension system
that supports various complementary elements (e.g. public extension staff, local
private extension agents, lead farmers, Farmers’ Information and Advice Centres,
ICT connectivity, gender focus).

41. Improved access to knowledge, markets, market and price information and
financial services will help contribute to the sustainability of CIGs and POs
supported by the project. To further increase smallholders’ voices and economic
strength in the selected value chains, NATP-II will establish producer organizations
for farmers. In addition, bankable CIGs and POs will be linked up with financing
institutions involved in other programmes/projects supporting access to finances.

42. The sustainability of NATP-II outcomes will further be supported by the institutional
capacity and skills development agenda of the project.

E. Risk identification and mitigation
43. The overall risks of NATP-II not achieving the project development objectives and

targets, and for NATP-II activities to have a negative impact on the people and the
environment are considered substantial.

44. The substantial risks identified with regard to policies and sector strategies refer to
the potential for lack of operationalization of the Bangladesh Agricultural Research
Council Act; delays in hiring public extension workers by the Ministry of Fisheries
and Livestock; and the lengthy approval process for the validation of the NAEP.
Under NATP-II, these will be addressed through: (i) strengthening the BARC
institutional capacity in the area of research management by hiring an international
service provider; (ii) expanding the use of private community-based extension
agents for livestock and fisheries with the aim of developing sustainable models for
private extension (e.g. scaling up fee-based services for livestock, promoting
additional sources of revenues for local extension agents for fisheries; and
(iii) adopting in NATP-II some of the core pillars of the NAEP (e.g. promoting a
group approach, complementary farmer-to-farmer extension; promoting private
extension services, etc.).

45. The substantial risk identified with respect to institutional capacity for
implementation refers to the challenges in coordinating four line agencies from two
different ministries and their capacity to implement the respective components. As
shown in the previous project, the coordination challenge can be adequately
addressed through a neutral PMU that has strong leadership. The recruitment of a
senior project director and a team of technical experts (consultants only, no civil
servants) at the PMU level will be a key factor for the successful coordination
across line agencies. An important mitigation measure in the implementation
arrangements for NATP-II (different from the previous project) is the support from
service providers recruited internationally for each line agency.

V. Corporate considerations
A. Compliance with IFAD policies
46. NATP-2 is fully aligned with the IFAD Strategic Framework 2011-2015 and with the

current RB-COSOP for Bangladesh, focusing on market access and value chains,
and on the economic empowerment of marginalized people. The project design
adheres to IFAD policies on private sector participation, environment, targeting and
gender. It further complies with the World Bank’s safeguards on indigenous people.
In terms of environmental impacts, the project is classified as “B”.

B. Alignment and harmonization
47. The project, whose design has seen the close involvement of the Government of

Bangladesh, will support the Government’s strategic priorities in agriculture, i.e.
increasing production, achieving food security, supporting adaptation to climate
change, and enhancing nutrition through safer and more diversified food. NATP-II
will support the decentralization process already under way for agricultural
research and extension services.

48. Project implementation will be done through existing government structures at
central level and, when available, at decentralized levels.

49. NATP-II will be cofinanced by the World Bank and USAID. It benefits from the
experience of all three partners and will link up with existing and relevant projects,
such as the IFAD-supported PACE project and the Haor Infrastructure and
Livelihood Improvement Project.

C. Innovations and scaling up
50. With the Agricultural Innovation Fund, NATP-II offers a tool to promote research

efforts for new and innovative technologies. The AIF is at the core of the NATP-II
scaling-up strategy; it aims at providing grant funding for eligible research and
microproject proposals to be implemented by potential project beneficiaries. The
AIF promotes a competitive research grant programme; farmers’ adoption of
innovative technologies generated by the research community; and will support
private operators in developing business and market opportunities for farmers and
by providing relevant private services to farmers (through matching grants).

D. Policy engagement
51. With its contributions to the agricultural technology development, NATP-II is

expected to support policies that create an enabling environment for smallholder
farmers. This work will include commodity-specific market and value chain
analyses, and the preparation of sector policy notes for senior decision makers.

VI. Legal instruments and authority
52. A programme financing agreement between the People’s Republic of Bangladesh

and IFAD will constitute the legal instrument for extending the proposed financing
to the borrower. A copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as
appendix I.

53. The People’s Republic of Bangladesh is empowered under its laws to receive
financing from IFAD.

54. I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.

VII. Recommendation
55. I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of

Recommendation for approval
The Executive Board is invited to approve the recommendation for the proposed
financing to the Republic of Nepal for Samriddhi – Rural Enterprises and
Remittances Project, as contained in paragraph 42.

Proposed loan and grant to the Republic of Nepal for
Samriddhi – Rural Enterprises and Remittances Project

I. Strategic context and rationale
A. Country and rural development and poverty context
1. Nepal has a population of 26.6 million people, of whom 56 per cent are 20-40

years of age. It is a low-income country with a per capita GDP of US$642, which is
the second lowest in South Asia. Since the end of the decade-long internal conflict
in 2006, insecurity and political instability have contributed to relatively slow GDP
growth. The majority of the population still lives on low-input/low-output
agriculture that provides limited income. Thus wage labour and widespread
migration have obligated 3 million Nepalese, mostly from rural areas, to be
employed abroad. The development of the service sector is partly due to a boom in
migration remittances, which have multiplied by a factor of six since 2003-2004,
now reaching 25 per cent of GDP, to about 55 per cent of rural households and still
increasing. Additionally, the poverty incidence decreased from 42 per cent in 1996
to 25 per cent in 2010, primarily due to the impact of remittances.

B. Rationale and alignment with government priorities and
RB-COSOP

2. Samriddhi1 – Rural Enterprises and Remittances Project has been developed in line
with the 2013-2018 results-based COSOP (RB-COSOP) and the Government of
Nepal’s request to harness remittances in support of entrepreneurship.

3. In line with Nepal’s National Development Plan, Industry Policy and Agriculture
Development Strategy, the project will diversify the range of economic activities
accessible to poor rural households and unemployed young men and women
through two main avenues. First, it will promote self-employment and small
businesses and microenterprises that can generate better incomes and jobs –
through both on farm and off-farm activities. Second, it will promote vocational
training and apprenticeship in direct connection with gainful job placement. In
addition, the approach to rural enterprises and remittances (RER) will develop
mechanisms specifically targeting migrant households and returnees, so they can
make the best possible use of their remittances.

4. Samriddhi will contribute to all three RB-COSOP strategic objectives. It will be the
first IFAD project to scale up Financing Facility for Remittances good practices into
an investment project, as well as the first to promote a comprehensive set of
mechanisms fostering remittance investment in livelihood development in Nepal.

II. Project description
A. Project area and target group
5. The project will be implemented in 16 districts of the Eastern and Central

Development Regions. It will use a corridor approach that links districts along the
main roads running south to north to facilitate the connection of hill districts to
larger markets in the terai (plains). Samriddhi will target a total of some 179,000

1 ‘Samriddhi’ is a Nepali word meaning prosperous or economically well-off.



EB 2015/114/R.13

2

primary beneficiaries, which will include existing rural micro/cottage and small
enterprises (RMSEs), poor households, returnee migrants and small enterprises.
The secondary target group will include medium and large enterprises as well as
service providers, who will be harnessed to provide support to the primary target
group through the development of business partnerships, vocational training,
apprenticeship packages and job placement. The project will also provide financial
education to 244,800 people to support financial inclusion.

6. Samriddhi will adopt an inclusive approach in which all existing micro-cottage and
small enterprises and all potential entrepreneurs – involved in both farming and
non-farming activities – will be eligible to access project-sponsored services in the
target districts. However, project support will vary according to the size of
enterprises, with a higher proportion of project grant funding provided to family-
based enterprises and the poorest groups, and a lesser proportion extended to
small enterprises. In addition, the project will ensure that poorer households,
women and other disadvantaged groups have access to project services and that
these are adapted to their needs.

B. Project development objective
7. The project goal is to contribute to reducing poverty and achieving sustainable

peace through employment-focused, equitable and inclusive economic
development. The development objective is that viable RMSEs, in both farm and
off-farm sectors, provide sustainable sources of income to poor households,
migrant families and returnees. Main indicators are: (i) 57,500 rural entrepreneurs
expand their existing business or create a new one; (ii) 30,000 rural youth access
job placement services; (iii) 34,500 enterprises are supported by Samriddhi
(22,500 new and 12,000 existing); and (iv) 21,000 vocational trainees and
apprentices are supported by Samriddhi, of which no less than 33 per cent are
women.

C. Components/outcomes
8. The project has three components: Component 1 – Promotion of RMSEs aims to

(i) provide micro and small entrepreneurs with sustainable access to adapted
business development services, so they can expand existing businesses or create
new ones; and (ii) assist members of poor households in building their skills and
securing gainful wage employment in RMSEs. Activities will be driven by an
assessment of markets, business opportunities and available services and by an
inventory and classification of existing RMSEs through a validation process.
Enterprise Service Centres (ESCs)2 will facilitate RMSE linkages with financial and
non-financial service providers, provide counselling services and information,
promote business partnerships and manage a system for the qualification,
capacity-building and quality monitoring of service providers.

9. Component 2 – Productive investment aims to (i) support the access of
RMSEs, migrants and remittance recipient households to responsive and suitable
financial services; and (ii) facilitate the financial inclusion of migrants and their
families, support their access to reintegration and peer-counselling services and
harness remittances for productive investment in rural enterprises. It will develop
innovative financial instruments designed to offset major constraints faced by
RMSEs in affordably accessing investment loans and to stimulate migrants’ savings
and investment in small business development. This will include: a risk-sharing
scheme to address RMSEs lack of collateral; a performance-based matching grant
scheme for family and microenterprises with insufficient cash flow to borrow money
in the initial stages of microenterprise development; and a departure loan buy-
back scheme targeting migrants. Capacity-building will be provided to financial
institutions in target districts, and in particular to savings and credit cooperatives

(SCCs) and to Small Farmers Cooperatives Limited, to deliver responsive services
to the target population.

10. Component 3 – Institutional support and project management aims to
promote a favourable policy and institutional environment supporting the
development of RMSEs and the contribution of migration to sustainable
development. To this effect, Samriddhi will finance policy studies and research, as
well as activities enabling selected stakeholders representing the interests of
RMSEs or of migration stakeholders to participate in policy dialogue with the
Government. Additionally, Samriddhi will support capacity-building of institutions
that play a key role in creating a conducive environment for small businesses and
microenterprises and for migrants’ reintegration. Finally, it will assist in setting up
a multi-stakeholder platform on migration and development (MPMD), which will
provide a venue for policy dialogue on the integration of migration into the
development agenda and for developing policy measures to facilitate migrant
reintegration and to promote their economic initiatives in the country.

III. Project implementation
A. Approach
11. The project strategy is driven by a primary concern that existing RMSEs need

support at national and local levels to develop, increase family income, generate
economic activities and improve employment. In addition, the promotion of RMSEs
must rest on sustainable structures and on mechanisms allowing continued access
of entrepreneurs to commercially-oriented services even beyond project
completion. Thus the project is designed as a temporary intervention aiming to
prepare public and private stakeholders to take over the responsibilities and costs
of securing continued RMSEs access to financial and non-financial services.

B. Organizational framework
12. The set-up of Samriddhi is based on public/private partnerships geared to support

inclusive and sustainable rural economic growth. While the Government retains
overall implementation and facilitation responsibility, non-governmental players will
have a key role in providing business development and financial services to target
groups for the creation and expansion of RMSEs and for maximizing the
development impact of migrant remittances through business investment.
Implementation arrangements also take stock of the long-lasting and strong
partnership between the Government and the Federation of Nepal Chambers of
Commerce and Industry, which is already implementing several initiatives
supporting RMSEs and rural producers.

C. Planning, monitoring and evaluation, and learning and
knowledge management

13. The integrated monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and knowledge management (KM)
system will be developed in accordance with government frameworks and with
IFAD guidelines. It will have three main objectives: steer project implementation;
support economic decisions and policymaking; and share knowledge and scale up
good practices.

14. The M&E/KM cycle will start with the preparation of the annual workplan and
budget (AWP/B). All Samriddhi stakeholders will have an active and important role
in identifying and reporting data. M&E officers at all levels will ensure that women
are adequately represented in this process and that they are supported in voicing
their specific concerns. To guarantee an inclusive M&E/KM system, Samriddhi will
provide capacity-building to the project management team (PMT), corridor teams
and ESC staff.

15. The purpose of knowledge management is to ensure that knowledge generated
within the project is systematically identified, analysed, documented and shared.



EB 2015/114/R.13

4

Particular attention will be given to documenting: innovative models; information
to be shared with and discussed by the MPMD with a view to assessing progress
and discussing measures to improve performance; and Learning Routes, which will
be organized to support the exchange of knowledge and good practices among
ESCs.

D. Financial management, procurement and governance
16. Financial management will be governed by Ministry of Finance regulations and

will be in line with IFAD guidelines on financial management. The financial
management system will be under the overall responsibility of the Samriddhi
project manager and the accounts officer. A finance and administrative officer will
also be competitively hired from the open market. The draft project
implementation manual (PIM) – established at final design and to be approved by
IFAD – includes a financial management section describing IFAD procedures for the
withdrawal application process, flow of funds, accounting and financial reporting
and audit requirements. A complete financial management assessment was
undertaken and the residual risk was found to be ‘medium’, to be mitigated
efficiently through the following measures: professional software-based
accounting; stringent reporting requirements; accountability; internal audit
provision; and a detailed finance manual. Two designated accounts in United States
dollars will be opened at the Nepal Rastra Bank (central bank), through which
advance resources from the loan and grant will be channelled respectively. The
Government’s Financial Administration Regulations will be used as the basis for
accounting and appropriate controls over financial transactions, and will be
supplemented by separate ledgers, registers and reporting formats to record and
report IFAD expenditures by categories, components, subcomponents and
activities. Consolidated project financial statements will be prepared in accordance
with internationally recognized accounting standards.

17. Internal control and audit. The PMT accounts officer will be responsible for
tracking project expenditure, managing assets and procurement and monitoring
fiduciary aspects of district- and corridor-level project activities. The project will
continue the existing practice of internal audit by the District Treasury Control
Office, in line with government financial rules and regulations. With regard to
external audit, the Office of the Auditor General is considered an independent body
under the respective government offices and is responsible for final project audit.
Audits shall be carried out in accordance with International Standards on Auditing
and IFAD’s Guidelines on Project Audits.

18. Procurement. The procurement of goods, works and services financed from
resources provided or administered by IFAD will be undertaken in accordance with
the provision of the Public Procurement Act and associated regulations, Public
Procurement Rules and the provisions of IFAD’s Procurement Guidelines and
Handbook. Goods and services (non-consulting) procured using national
competitive bidding, national shopping and direct contracting will follow the
procedures and processes defined in the PIM to be approved by the project
steering committee (PSC) and IFAD. The selection of individual consultants and
individual service providers will also be defined in the PIM, which will provide
details of the selection method to be applied.

E. Supervision
19. Annual supervision missions will be organized by IFAD jointly with the Government,

in close collaboration with field-level implementers and project stakeholders.
Supervision will not be conducted as an inspection, but will rather offer an
opportunity to assess achievements and lessons jointly, to review innovations and
to reflect on improvement measures.

B. Project financing
21. The Government of Nepal, IFAD, the private sector and beneficiaries will finance

the project. IFAD total financing amounts to US$38.61 million, equivalent to
56.7 per cent of total project financing (24.7 per cent under the form of a Debt
Sustainability Framework grant and 32 per cent through a highly concessional
loan). The Government would finance taxes, duties and salaries, and is further
expected to contribute to the cost of the salary of one staff member for each ESC
and to vocational training, for a total of US$9.1 million. The private sector
contribution is estimated at US$13.7 million. Overall beneficiaries’ contributions are
estimated at US$6.6 million.

22. Taxes and duties will not be financed by IFAD.

C. Summary benefit and economic analysis
23. Samriddhi will target a total of some 179,660 primary beneficiaries:

60,000 entrepreneurs; 89,660 people who will access jobs generated by the newly
created and expanded RMSEs; and about 30,000 people, mostly youth, who will
benefit from vocational training and apprenticeship.

24. Additionally, the project will provide financial education in-country and abroad to
213,100 people, mostly migrants and migrants’ households. An estimated
10 per cent of these will access other project services.

25. The secondary target group will include: (i) medium and large enterprises and
service providers, who will extend support to the primary target group; and
(ii) 22,500 enterprises (from category B to medium and large), who will benefit
from capacity-building to make the best use of apprenticeships.

26. Furthermore, project investments will lead to indirect benefits for RMSEs and poor
households beyond the target area.

27. The base-case scenario for a 20-year period of analysis shows an economic rate of
return of 26 per cent and a net present value of US$37.7 million.

D. Sustainability
28. Samriddhi strategy and activities are driven by the primary concern that, by the

end of project implementation, sustainable mechanisms will ensure continued
RMSE access to financial and non-financial services. This will be attained through:
(i) public/private partnerships that provide target groups with sufficient returns and
include capacity-building and expansion opportunities; (ii) financial sustainability of
RMSEs and ESCs through sound business plans, with incentives to support start-
up, cost-recovery mechanisms, capacity-building of key players, linkages to
performing financial service providers (SPs) and resource mobilization; (iii) use of
local resources to develop entrepreneurship, expand the range of business
development services SPs and generate jobs; and (iv) promotion of business
partnerships between the smallest enterprises and value chain aggregators, which
will facilitate continued RMSEs access to services and markets and promote their
growth beyond initial project-financed support.

29. The second interim review, planned for the end of the fifth year, will make
recommendations with regard to key measures required to secure the sustainability
of project achievements, based on which the PMT will prepare a detailed exit
strategy.

E. Risk identification and mitigation
30. Most risks associated with this project remain medium or low, and mitigation

measures have been identified for all risks. The three risks remaining high are
given below.



EB 2015/114/R.13

7

31. Risks associated with the project related to the Government or other development
organizations paying protracted subsidies and in-kind support to entrepreneurs to
establish their businesses, which will be mitigated by sharing implementation
modalities and successful achievements with the MPMD and government partners
to foster harmonization. In addition, Samriddhi and ESCs will negotiate
coordination agreements at the district level to ensure that subsidies do not
undermine the Samriddhi approach to sustainability.

32. The risk that the volume of service business will not be sufficient to generate an
adequate income for full-time SPs will be mitigated by project support to several
mechanisms facilitating sustainable SP access.

33. The risk that public/private migration stakeholders fail to take responsibility for the
operation and financing of the MPMD will be mitigated by project interventions to:
(i) set up the platform and develop plans and tools; (ii) finance the MPMD
secretariat and operations; (iii) draft a law to institutionalize the platform; and
(iv) support migrant organizations in developing advocacy skills.

V. Corporate considerations
Compliance with IFAD policiesA.

34. The design of Samriddhi was guided by IFAD’s policies and strategies on: targeting,
gender and private-sector engagement. The project is in line with IFAD’s specific
objectives on remittances, which aim to: enhance market development and
financial access through the identification, replication and scaling up of innovative
remittance transfer systems; promote financial inclusion among migrants and
remittance-recipient families in rural areas through better use of remittances; and
create an enabling environment that promotes public/private partnerships for
effective remittance development strategies.

Alignment and harmonizationB.
35. A PSC will be set up at the national level to: provide overall guidance and

oversight; ensure that Samriddhi programming is aligned with national-sector
priorities; and offer a venue for sharing Samriddhi good practices and for
channelling policy issues to the appropriate policymaking bodies. The PSC will also
approve annual AWP/Bs and annual progress and financial reports.

36. Samriddhi will rely on existing district industry promotion committees to: develop a
dialogue among stakeholders involved in RMSE development; discuss RMSE
constraints and value chain bottlenecks; agree on measures required to free them;
and identify policy gaps and provide guidance to ESCs. It will ensure that ESC
activities are inclusive of women and poor people, and that gender equality and
social inclusion issues are addressed as part of their regular agenda.

Innovations and scaling upC.
37. The PMT and business development services technical assistance will assist ESCs in

developing innovative modalities for service delivery, such as: (i) developing
systems alternative to price (commissions or mark-ups) that link payment to actual
results/impact on business; (ii) promoting SPs that have an existing business and
do not rely solely on service provision to make a living, including cooperatives or
producers’ associations; and (iii) assisting SPs in developing businesses in
conjunction with RMSEs promotion (for example, large farmers buying agricultural
products from serviced farmers). Innovative models will be thoroughly documented
with support from corridor teams and will be shared across target regions and
through multistakeholder platforms at the district industry promotion committee
level, regional (Eastern Business Forum) and national levels (National Business
Forum, the project steering committee).

Policy engagementD.
38. The project will support selected stakeholders representing the interests of RMSEs

or of migrants to participate in policy dialogue with the Government. Samriddhi will
finance studies and research enabling such stakeholders to: (i) develop policy
positions; (ii) organize policy consultations of members at regional and national
levels; and (iii) acquire advocacy skills.

VI. Legal instruments and authority
39. A financing agreement between the Republic of Nepal and IFAD will constitute the

legal instrument for extending the proposed financing to the borrower/recipient. A
copy of the negotiated financing agreement is attached as an annex.

40. The Republic of Nepal is empowered under its laws to receive financing from IFAD.

41. I am satisfied that the proposed financing will comply with the Agreement
Establishing IFAD and the Policies and Criteria for IFAD Financing.

VII. Recommendation
42. I recommend that the Executive Board approve the proposed financing in terms of

the following resolutions:

RESOLVED: that the Fund shall provide a loan on highly concessional terms to
the Republic of Nepal in an amount equivalent to fifteen million five hundred
thousand special drawing rights (SDR 15,500,000), and upon such terms and

ect Description

1.
Targ

et Population. The Project shall be implemented in sixteen (16) selected districts of the
Eastern and Central Development Regions (the “Project Area”). The Project shall target a
total of approximately one hundred and seventy nine thousand (179 000) primary
beneficiaries, including (i) existing rural micro and small enterprises (the “RMSEs”); (ii)
poor households; (iii) returnee migrants and remittance receiving households; and (iv)
small enterprises. The secondary target group includes medium and large enterprises as
well as service providers, who will provide support to the primary beneficiaries through the
development of business partnerships, vocational training, apprenticeship packages and
job placement.

2.
Goal.

The goal of the Project is to contribute to poverty reduction and sustainable peace
through employment-focused, equitable and inclusive economic development.

3.
Obje

ctive. The development objective is that viable RMSEs, in both farming and off-farming
sectors, provide sustainable sources of income to poor households, migrant families and
returnees. Main indicators include: (i) approximately fifty-seven thousand and five



Annex EB 2015/114/R.13

13

hundred (57 500) rural entrepreneurs expand their existing business or create a new one;
(ii) approximately thirty thousand (30 000) rural youth access job placement services; (iii)
approximately thirty-four thousand and five hundred (34 500) enterprises are supported
by the Project; and (iv) approximately twenty-one thousand (21 000) vocational trainees
and apprentices are supported by the Project, and the share of women is no less than
thirty-three percent (33%).

4.
Com

ponents. The Project shall consist of the following Components:

4.1. Component 1: Promotion of RMSEs

This Component aims at (i) providing micro and small entrepreneurs with sustainable
access to adapted Business Development Services (the “BDS”), so that they can expand
existing businesses or create new ones; and (ii) assisting members of poor households
to build their skills and to secure gainful wage employment in RMSEs. Activities will be
driven by an assessment of markets, business opportunities and available services and
by an inventory and classification of existing RMSEs through a validation process.
Enterprise Service Centres (the “ESCs”) will facilitate RMSEs linkages with financial and
non-financial service providers, provide counselling services and information and
promote business partnerships and manage a system for the qualification, capacity
building and quality monitoring of service providers. This Component is composed of
three (3) sub-components as follows:

4.1.1. Sub-component 1.1: Mapping and setting up capacities at district and corridor
level. Investments in this sub-component aim at mapping business potential and
stakeholders in the three target corridors managed by two Corridor Teams, and at
setting up the institutional capacities at district and corridor level to facilitate RMSEs’
access to services.

4.1.2. Sub-component 1.2: Services for RMSE promotion and development. Investments
in this sub-component aim at facilitating RMSEs’ access to responsive, gender-sensitive
and sustainable services, so that they develop profitable and sustainable businesses
taking advantage of local opportunities.

4.1.3. Sub-component 1.3: Vocational training and apprenticeship. Investments in this
sub-component aim at assisting members of poor households to build their skills and to
secure gainful wage employment in RMSEs.

4.2.
Com

ponent 2: Productive Investment

This Component aims at (i) supporting the access of RMSEs, migrants and remittance
recipient households to responsive and suitable financial services; and (ii) facilitating the
financial inclusion of migrants and their families, supporting their access to reintegration
and peer-counselling services and harnessing remittances for productive investment in
rural enterprises. It shall develop innovative financial instruments designed to offset
major constraints faced by RMSEs in accessing investment loans at an affordable cost
and to stimulate migrants’ savings and investment in small business development. This
shall include: a risk-sharing scheme to address RMSEs’ lack of collateral; a performance-
based matching grant scheme for family and micro enterprises with insufficient cash flow
for borrowing money in the initial stages of micro-enterprise development; and a
departure loan buy-back scheme targeting migrants. Capacity building will be provided
to financial institutions in the target districts, and in particular to Savings and Credit
Cooperatives (the “SCCs”) and to Small Farmers Cooperatives Limited (the “SFCLs”), to
deliver responsive services to the target population.



Annex EB 2015/114/R.13

14

This Component shall also improve financial institutions and cooperatives’ outreach in
the target districts, by co-financing investment costs related to installing innovative
modalities to reach out to rural populations. Specific activities targeting migrants and
their families shall aim at building the capacities of partner migrant organisations to
deliver a core pool of services including financial education to support better family
budget management and the productive use of remittance and access to financial
products. District SCCs and SFCLs shall also receive capacity building to provide financial
education to migrants and rural communities at large, so that they can market their
financial products and services in support to financial inclusion. This Component shall
establish a partnership with the Non-Resident Nepali Association (the “NRNA”) to deliver
a similar range of services in destination countries, to be jointly selected based on a list
of pre-set criteria;

This Component is composed of three (3) sub-components as follows:

4.2.1. Sub-component 2.1: Financial inclusion. Investments sub-component 2.1 aim at
facilitating the access of RMSEs as well as migrants and their families to adequate
financial services.

4.2.2. Sub-component 2.2: Mobilising migrant resources and skills. Investments in this
sub-component aim at strengthening and, where necessary, creating the capacity of
migrant centres and associations to expand their network and the delivery of services to
migrants and their families, both in the target districts and in destination countries.

4.3.
Com

ponent 3: Institutional Support and Project Management

Component 3 aims at promoting a favourable policy and institutional environment
supporting the development of RMSEs and the contribution of migration to sustainable
development. To this effect, the Project shall finance policy studies and research, as well
as activities enabling selected stakeholders representing the interests of RMSEs or of
migration stakeholders to participate in policy dialogue with the government.
Additionally, the Project shall support the building of capacities of institutions that play a
key role in creating a conducive environment for RMSEs and for migrants’ reintegration.
Finally it shall assist in setting up a Multi-Stakeholder Platform on Migration and
Development, which shall provide a venue for policy dialogue on the integration of
migration in the development agenda and for developing policy measures to facilitate
migrant reintegration and promote their economic initiatives.
