I. Project Context
Country Context
Ethiopia is a large and diverse country. It is land-locked and located in the Horn of Africa, with an 
area of 1.1 million km2. Its bio-physical environment includes a variety of ecosystems, with 
significant differences in climate, soil properties, vegetation types, and agricultural potential, 
biodiversity and water resources. Ethiopia is a country of many nations, nationalities and peoples, 
with a total population of 91.7 million (2012).  Only 17 percent of the population lives in urban 
centres, the great majority of them in Addis Ababa. At a current annual growth rate of 2.6 percent, 
Ethiopia’s population is estimated to reach 130 million by 2025, and is projected by the UN to be 
among the world’s ten largest countries by 2050. Ethiopia is vulnerable to terms of trade shocks 
from international food and fuel prices, and to large domestic weather-related shocks as 
demonstrated by the 2011/12 East Africa drought. 
 
Ethiopia has a federal, democratic government system, established in the early 1990s, with nine 
autonomous states (‘regions’) and two chartered cities. Decentralization of governance to the

regional and district (woreda) levels has been actively pursued since 2003. The Ethiopian People’s 
Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) has been in power in Ethiopia since 1991. EPRDF 
comprises four regionally-based parties from the four major regions (Amhara, Oromia, Southern 
Nations, Nationalities and Peoples (SNNPR), and Tigray). The long-serving Prime Minister, Meles 
Zenawi, (from Tigray) died in August 2012 and was succeeded by Hailemariam Desalegn (from 
SNNPR) who has pursued largely the same policies. The next national elections are scheduled for 
2015. 
 
Ethiopia has experienced strong economic growth over the past decade. Economic growth averaged 
10.7 percent per year in 2003/04 to 2011/12, compared to the regional average of 5.0 percent. 
Growth reflected a mix of factors, including agricultural modernization, the development of new 
export sectors, strong global commodity demand, and government-led development investments. 
Private consumption and public investment have driven demand side growth, with the latter 
assuming an increasingly important role in recent years. On the supply side, growth was driven by 
an expansion of the services and agricultural sectors, while the role of the industrial sector was 
relatively modest. Recently, annual growth rates have declined slightly, but still remain at high 
single-digit levels. Growth in the export of goods has also moderated in recent years and a decline 
was observed in 2012/13 for the first time since 2008/09. There have been bouts of high inflation in 
recent years and, while inflation is currently much lower, keeping it down remains a major 
objective for monetary policy. 
 
Ethiopia is one of the world's poorest countries, but has made substantial progress on social and 
human development over the past decade. The country’s per capita income of US$470  is 
substantially lower than the regional average of US$1,257 and among the ten lowest worldwide. 
Ethiopia is ranked 173 out of 187 countries in the Human Development Index (HDI) of the United 
Nations Development Program (UNDP). High economic growth, however, has helped reduce 
poverty in both urban and rural areas. Since 2005, 2.5 million people have been lifted out of 
poverty, and the share of the population below the poverty line has fallen from 38.7 percent in 
2004/05 to 29.6 percent in 2010/11  (using a poverty line of close to US$1.25/day). However, 
because of high population growth, the absolute number of poor (about 25 million) has remained 
unchanged over the past fifteen years. Ethiopia is among the countries that have made the fastest 
progress on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and HDI ranking over the past decade. It 
is on track to achieve the MDGs for gender parity in education, child mortality, HIV/AIDS, and 
malaria. Good progress has been made in universal primary education, although the MDG target 
may not be met. Reduction of maternal mortality remains a key challenge. 
 
GoE is currently implementing its ambitious Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP; 
2010/11-2014/15), which sets a long-term goal of becoming a middle-income country by 2025, 
with growth rates of at least 11.2 percent per annum during the plan period. To achieve the GTP 
goals and objectives, GoE has followed a “developmental state” model with a strong role for the 
government in many aspects of the economy. It has prioritized key sectors such as industry and 
agriculture as drivers of sustained economic growth and job creation. The GTP also reaffirms 
GoE’s commitment to human development. Development partners have programs that are broadly 
aligned with GTP priorities. 
 
The World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, FY13-16) builds on the progress 
achieved by Ethiopia in recent years and aims to help GoE address structural transformation and 
assist in the implementation of the GTP. The CPS framework includes two pillars. Pillar One,

“Fostering competitiveness and employment”, aims to support Ethiopia in achieving: (i) a stable 
macroeconomic environment; (ii) increased competitiveness and productivity; (iii) increased and 
improved delivery of infrastructure; and (iv) enhanced regional integration.  Pillar Two, “Enhancing 
resilience and reducing vulnerabilities”, aims to support Ethiopia in improving the delivery of social 
services and developing a comprehensive approach to social protection and risk management. Good 
governance and state building form the foundation of the CPS. In line with the GTP, gender and 
climate change have been included as cross-cutting issues to strengthen their mainstreaming across 
the portfolio. The programs of IFC and MIGA are well aligned with the CPS framework, 
contributing mainly to the strategic objectives under Pillar One.

  

Sectoral and institutional Context
The agricultural sector remains a dominant sector in the Ethiopian economy and an important 
source of economic growth. Although there is an on-going structural transformation in the 
Ethiopian economy, predominantly from agriculture to services and manufacturing, agriculture still 
comprises 45 percent of total output and continues to dominate employment (78 percent). The 
sector is also a major contributor to export earnings, with over 80 percent of goods exports. Despite 
its declining share in the economy, the agriculture sector is growing rapidly. Over the past 15 years 
the average rate of growth has been around seven percent per year according to official statistics. 
Sources of growth have come from an increased area under cultivation and from increased 
productivity, the latter driven by large public investment in the sector, including agricultural 
extension, rural roads, and advances in public policy such as improvements in land tenure security. 
In addition to contributing to economic output and exports, agricultural growth is correlated with 
poverty reduction, for smallholder farmers and also through positive impacts on non-farm rural 
economies. 
 
Although Ethiopia has a trend of negative overall balance of trade, the country has consistently had 
a positive balance of trade in the agriculture sector. The agriculture imports per capita and exports 
per capita stood at $13.28 and $18.27 respectively in 2011. The top three agriculture exports have 
been coffee, oil seeds and pulses while the largest imports have been cereals, edible oils and sugar. 
In spite of the positive trade balances in the sector, marketing (including intra-regional trade) in the 
sector is constrained by mixed and often unfavorable policies for input and output markets and poor 
infrastructure leading to high transportation costs. There remains considerable potential for both 
increased exports from the sector and further import substitution, especially for cereals 
(predominantly wheat) and sugar.   
 
The further growth of the agriculture sector is expected to feature prominently in the second phase 
of the GTP (GTP-II), currently under preparation.  Maintaining the current growth rate in the sector 
will be challenging as recent gains from land expansion may be exhausted, and further increases 
will need to come from increased agricultural productivity. Progress requires both investment and 
policy reform.  The general thrust on policy reform is to pursue agricultural transformation by 
increasing private sector investment and value added in the country to increase the value of exports. 
In 2012, the Government agreed a G8 New Alliance framework for Ethiopia with a number of 
commitments for policy actions to facilitate the expansion of private investment.  Under this 
framework, the Government intends to focus its efforts in particular on: i) increasing stability and 
transparency in trade policy; ii) improving incentives for the private sector investment; iii) 
developing and implementing a transparent land tenure policy; and iv) developing and 
implementing domestic seed policies that encourage increased private sector involvement in this

area. To support the transformation agenda, the Government established the Agricultural 
Transformation Agency (ATA) in 2011 to support the Ministry of Agriculture to advance policy 
and build capacity.  Notable achievements include the new Agricultural Cooperatives Development 
Strategy and the passing of the Seeds Proclamation. 
 
The Government’s agricultural development strategy focuses on both encouraging large scale 
investment in commercial agriculture and support to smallholder farmers, who in 2012/13 
contributed 96 percent of the total agricultural production according to official statistics. To 
increase agricultural productivity of smallholders and their transformation to commercial farmers 
requires a strengthening and focusing of support services and infrastructure, and greater private 
investment to support input and output value chains.  To drive this transformation, the Government 
is moving towards focused support to specific commercialization clusters targeting areas with the 
highest potential for the production of commodities for which Ethiopia has a comparative 
advantage and can stimulate agro-processing and value addition.   
 
Despite the large investment into public agricultural services, especially into extension, which has 
seen a rapid rise in the number of extension workers and beneficiaries served year on year, there are 
capacity weaknesses which continue to inhibit the identification and dissemination of technologies 
to support increased productivity.  Strengthening research and extension linkages, further expansion 
and capacity of the extension service and enhancing farmer access to inputs are required to support 
investments in extension workers.  Improving agriculture research has been prioritized in GTP and 
the same is expected in GTP II because of the pivotal role it plays to improve agricultural 
productivity and production and recognizing that in recent years it has been underfunded.  Animal 
health and production services also suffer from capacity limitations and low outreach, leading to 
low productivity and quality across a range of animal products.  
 
Access to and application of agricultural inputs is a decisive factor to improve agricultural 
productivity and production.  In addition to improved seeds, animal breeds and fertilizers, there is 
considerable opportunity to promote the use of machinery for production and post-harvest 
activities.  Innovations such as row planters for teff have had a considerable impact on productivity. 
However, input markets in Ethiopia are typically overly dependent on cooperative unions and the 
agro-dealer market is small and underdeveloped.  While cooperatives can play an important role in 
linking smallholder farmers to input and output markets, they are often hampered by weak 
management and facilities, and currently only handle a small percentage of agricultural output.  
There is potential for strengthening cooperatives while also enabling greater private engagement in 
both input and output markets.  
 
Output marketing system and infrastructure in Ethiopia are dominated by traditional, informal 
exchanges. For a large part of the country, this means trading with limited infrastructure. There are 
few market structures, storage, loading and unloading facilities, quality checking and banking 
services in or around most of the market centers. This has resulted in the cost of trading being very 
high due to cumbersome conditions for transaction, low product qualities and post-harvest losses.  
Value chains (other than for coffee which has a relatively efficient market structures) are therefore 
characterized by an absence of market participants, market inefficiencies and limited value addition. 
With increasing agricultural surpluses, rapid urbanization and increased opportunities for agro-
industrial investment, there are gaps in the current functioning in a number of value chains which 
are prioritized under the commercialization cluster approach to achieving transformation.

Agricultural water development is crucial to improve smallholders’ livelihood and income in 
Ethiopia, since irrigation can help farmers increase their crop production, increase crop varieties, 
and lengthen their agricultural seasons. From a very low base, over the next five years there are 
targets to increase the total area of irrigated land from the current 640,000 hectares (about 4 percent 
of currently cultivated land) to about 1.8 million hectares. Small Scale Irrigation (SSI) and Rain 
Water Harvesting (RWH) will account for about two-thirds of this expansion, as these technologies 
require lower capital and technical investments and they are possible on small plain areas. Beyond 
the next five years, plans are to reach the full irrigable potential of the country of over 5 million 
hectares. Household irrigation as well as medium- and large-scale schemes will be an important 
strategy to achieve this goal, in combination with exploring and developing groundwater potential, 
especially given that an estimated 85 percent of Ethiopia’s total surface water irrigation potential is 
estimated to be in large-scale schemes.  
 
Future agricultural growth needs t o be sensitive to gender.  On average, female farm managers in 
Ethiopia produce 23 percent less (in terms of gross value of output) per hectare than their male 
counterparts. Differences in both the levels of productive factors used and the returns that these 
factors generate drive this gender gap. Future inclusive agricultural growth should consider: (i) the 
promotion of labor-saving technologies for women; (ii) the provision of relevant information to 
female farmers, customized to the needs of female farmers; and (iii) the easing of the time burden 
of household responsibilities, by providing services to reduce the time that female farmers need to 
perform household duties to enable them to devote more time to productive farm activities. Recent 
research demonstrates the potential of women to contribute to agricultural growth and improve 
outcomes, including improved nutrition.   
 
In Ethiopia, forty percent of children under the age of five suffer from stunting as a consequence of 
chronic and cyclical malnutrition. The National Nutrition Program (NNP) was revised in 2013 to 
strategically address the nutrition problem in the country to include initiatives that have emerged 
since the 2008 NNP, including taking into account the multisectoral and multidimensional nature of 
nutrition and the linkages among key implementing sectors, one being agriculture.  This program, 
endorsed by the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Health and another eight line Ministers, 
includes a strategic objective to strengthen implementation of nutrition sensitive interventions in the 
agriculture sector. The initiatives focus on improving the consumption of diversified diets at the 
household level through: (i) diversification of crop, fruits and livestock production; (ii) promotion 
of appropriate technologies for food production and processing through the handling, preparation 
and preservation for food diversification to ensure nutritious food utilization;  (iii) building the 
capacity of Development Agents (DAs) at community level and agriculture program managers at all 
levels to implement nutrition sensitive agriculture;  (iv) supporting local complementary food 
production and creating economic opportunities for women through development groups and 
cooperatives; and, (v) supporting agricultural research centers to develop seeds of high nutritional 
value.  Thus, it calls for aligning the agricultural growth programs to improve nutritional status. 
 
With the limits of bringing uncultivated land under production being met, the likelihood of climatic 
variability and the potential degradation arising from more intensive production practices increases, 
and thus there is an urgent need for agriculture to conserve resources and reduce degradation. In 
recent years, considerable amount of work in natural resource conservation and development work 
has been undertaken. In 2013/14 alone, the communities undertook natural resources conservations 
work on 20.15 million hectares of land throughout the country, according to official statistics.  This 
current momentum of community mobilization in natural resource conservation by pursuing

activities such as slope stabilization, watershed approaches to water management and reduction of 
tillage should be sustained to make the sector more resilient and sustainable. 
 
The opportunities for inclusive and sustainable growth in the sector are strong as is the 
Government’s commitment to achieving ambitious growth and transformation targets.  The 
Agricultural Sector Policy and Investment Framework (PIF), 2010 – 2020, provides an investment 
framework to align the investment and policy priorities with higher level goals to transform the 
sector and is designed to operationalize the CAADP Compact signed by the Government and its 
development partners. Under the PIF, there have been concerted efforts to collaborate and partner 
on investments and the Agricultural Growth Project (AGP I – P113032) was a clear output of this. 
The first phase of the program was financed to around US$350 million, including US$150 million 
from IDA, US$50 million from the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP), a US
$50 million Multi-donor Trust Fund with contributions from the Netherlands, Canada and Spain, 
and parallel financing from USAID and Italy.  Currently, AGPI operates at  kebele levels (the 
lowest administrative unit) in 96 woredas of the four regions of Amhara, Oromia, SNNPR and 
Tigray and has provided support for improved public agricultural service provision, technology 
transfer, improved market access and marketing, infrastructure (household and small-scale 
irrigation, feeder roads and market centers) and capacity building.  The project further explicitly 
aims to increase the participation of women and youth in the sector.  The proposed project therefore 
aims to build on AGP1, to scale up the geographical extent, consolidate the investments, and meet 
the emerging challenges of the sector outlines above. 
 
Under AGPI, the project has been operating in 4 regions (Amhara, Oromia, SNNP and Tigray), 96 
woredas and 2,423 kebeles, targeting 1.57 million direct beneficiaries.  The AGP2 project would 
cover 157 woredas, which would include all woredas targeted under AGP1 plus an additional 61. 
The woredas are distributed among the following regions: Amhara, Oromia, SNNPR, Tigray, 
Benshangul-Gumuz, Gambella, Harari and Dire Dawa Administrative Council. The expansion into 
the new regions and Dire Dawa would be on a limited scale, with two woredas in each of 
Benshangul-Gumuz and Gambella, and one in each of Harari and Dire Dawa.

technologies to the agricultural extension system; pre-extension demonstration and participatory 
research for recommended agricultural technologies; and source technology production, including 
the production of breeder and pre-basic seeds for major crop varieties.

Component Name
Small-scale Irrigation
Comments (optional)
To increase the access to and efficient utilization of irrigation water of small holder farmers, the 
project will support the increased availability of irrigated water through: i) the rehabilitation, 
upgrading and/or improvement of existing Small-scale Irrigation Schemes; ii) establishment of new 
SSI systems integrated with access roads where necessary; and iii) household irrigation systems. 
The project would also support improved water management services through establishing and/or 
strengthening Irrigation Water Users Organizations and the introduction of improved irrigation 
agricultural management.

Component Name
Agricultural Marketing and Value Chains
Comments (optional)
To commercialize small holder farmers through market access and efficiency of input and output 
markets, the project would support: the promotion and distribution of agricultural inputs, 
specifically seed multiplication and distribution; the strengthening of formal and informal farmer 
organizations, including formal farmer organizations and informal, commercially oriented farmer 
groups; the strengthening of selected livestock and crop value chains; and market infrastructure 
development and management.

Component Name
Project Management, Capacity Building and Monitoring and Evaluation.
Comments (optional)
To ensure project implementation, the effective monitoring and evaluation of results and a 
consistent and effective approach to capacity development, the project would support: project 
management and coordination; monitoring, evaluation and learning; and the Capacity Building 
Support Facility.

V. Implementation
The AGP 2 will build on institutional arrangements and implementation mechanisms established for 
th AGPI.  As in the first phase, the implementation of the project will rely on existing GoE 
structures, with the exception of parallel funding through the USAID and Canadian DFATD that 
will be channeled through specific implementation arrangements. The Ministry of Agriculture will 
have the overall responsibility of the coordination and implementation of the project. To fulfill its

responsibilities, the MoA will use - or will establish in the new targeted regions - the institutional 
mechanisms already established for AGP 1 at Federal, Regional, and Woreda levels, i.e: (i) the 
Steering Committees (SCs), (ii) the Technical Committees (TCs), and (iii) the Project’s 
Coordination Units (CUs). The existing composition of these Committees will be reviewed in order 
to include new implementing agencies such as the Ethiopian Institute for Agricultural Research 
(EIAR). At the Zonal level, the Zonal Agriculture Office (ZAO) will provide technical support, 
extension services and M&E to the group of woredas under its authority. The ZAOs will coordinate 
with the Woreda Offices of Agriculture (WOA). 
 
Implementation of the project will be decentralized. Federal implementing agencies will provide 
guidance and support to regions, spearhead most institutional capacity building activities and 
undertake monitoring, evaluation and communication activities. At regional and woreda levels, the 
Bureaus/Offices of Agriculture will assume primary responsibility for execution of the project.  
Implementation of AGP at the regional level will also be supported by relevant service providers 
and institutions.  
 
The annual planning process will follow a two-pronged approach associating: (i) a demand-driven 
approach based on the Community Level Participatory Planning (CLPP) approach adopted for AGP-
I in which communities are assuming primary responsibility for identifying and executing the 
community-based investment of the project, and (ii) a strategic-based approach in which 
investments are pre-identified through the Kebele, Woreda and Regional development plan or 
through specific feasibility studies, and implemented in close collaboration with the community 
after a consultation process. At the woreda and kebele levels, the implementation of the project 
would be undertaken jointly by Woreda Office of Agriculture through the Woreda Development 
Committee (WDC), the Kebele Development Committee (KDC), and the communities. The WDC 
and the KDC will be guided by their respective SCs and TCs.
